643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. **The Puzzle:**  In a circle with center O, CD is the diameter, chord DE is parallel to chord OA, and the measure of angle D is 50 degrees.  What is the measure of angle C?

2. **Cracking the Code:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**  Since CD is a diameter, angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.  Also, since DE is parallel to OA, angle AOD is equal to angle DOE (alternate interior angles).

* **Step 2: Apply angle properties.**  The sum of the angles in triangle COD is 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle COD + angle CDO + angle DCO = 180 degrees.  We know angle COD = 180 degrees and angle CDO = 50 degrees.  Substituting these values, we get 180 degrees + 50 degrees + angle DCO = 180 degrees.

* **Step 3: Solve for angle DCO.**  Simplifying the equation, we get angle DCO = 180 degrees - 180 degrees - 50 degrees = -50 degrees.  However, angles cannot be negative.  This means we need to consider the other side of the angle.  Since angle DCO is an obtuse angle, its measure is 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees.

* **Step 4:  Find angle C.**  Angle C is equal to angle DCO because they are both inscribed angles that intercept the same arc (arc DE).  Therefore, angle C = angle DCO = 130 degrees.

3. **The Solution:** The degree of angle C is 130 degrees.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"1. **The Puzzle:**  Find the length of the hypotenuse, *h*, of a right triangle given that one leg is 4 units long and the angle opposite that leg is 60 degrees.

2. **Cracking the Code:**

* **Understanding the Problem:** We have a right triangle with one known side (the leg opposite the 60-degree angle) and one known angle. We need to find the hypotenuse. 

* **Trigonometric Ratios:**  We can use the trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) to relate the sides and angles of a right triangle.  

* **Choosing the Right Ratio:** Since we know the opposite side (4) and want to find the hypotenuse (h), we'll use the sine function. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse:

    sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse

* **Applying the Formula:** In our case, the angle is 60 degrees, the opposite side is 4, and the hypotenuse is *h*.  Substituting these values into the sine formula:

    sin(60°) = 4 / *h*

* **Solving for *h*:** To isolate *h*, we can multiply both sides of the equation by *h* and then divide both sides by sin(60°):

    *h* * sin(60°) = 4
    *h* = 4 / sin(60°)

* **Evaluating sin(60°):** The sine of 60 degrees is √3 / 2.

* **Calculating *h*:** Substituting the value of sin(60°) into the equation:

    *h* = 4 / (√3 / 2)
    *h* = 8 / √3

* **Rationalizing the Denominator:** To simplify the answer, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by √3:

    *h* = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
    *h* = 8√3 / 3

3. **The Solution:** The length of the hypotenuse, *h*, is **8√3 / 3** units.

2. **Cracking the Code:**

* **Understanding Inscribed Angles:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share a common endpoint on the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

* **Identifying the Relevant Arc:**  ∠ABC intercepts arc AC.  ∠AOC is the central angle that intercepts the same arc AC.

* **Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** Since ∠ABC is an inscribed angle and ∠AOC is the corresponding central angle, we can use the inscribed angle theorem:

    *  ∠ABC = (1/2) ∠AOC

* **Solving for ∠AOC:**  We know ∠ABC = 70°.  Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

    * 70° = (1/2) ∠AOC

    * Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

    * ∠AOC = 140°

    * **Step 2: Calculate the area of the rectangle.** The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. 
        * Area of rectangle = length * width
        * Area of rectangle = 41 ft * 48 ft
        * Area of rectangle = 1968 sq ft

    * **Step 3: Calculate the area of the triangle.** The area of a triangle is calculated by multiplying its base and height, then dividing by 2.
        * Area of triangle = (base * height) / 2
        * Area of triangle = (12 ft * 48 ft) / 2
        * Area of triangle = 288 sq ft

    * **Step 4: Add the areas of the rectangle and triangle to find the total area.**
        * Total area = Area of rectangle + Area of triangle
        * Total area = 1968 sq ft + 288 sq ft
        * Total area = 2256 sq ft

2. **Cracking the Code:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant angles.** We are given that angle AOD is 70 degrees. Since angles AOD and DOC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees), we can find the measure of angle DOC: 
    * Angle DOC = 180 degrees - angle AOD = 180 degrees - 70 degrees = 110 degrees.

* **Step 2: Understand the concept of angle bisector.** Ray OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides angle BOC into two equal angles. Let's call each of these smaller angles x.

* **Step 3: Apply the angle addition postulate.** The measure of angle BOC is equal to the sum of the measures of angles BOE and EOC:
    * Angle BOC = angle BOE + angle EOC = x + x = 2x

* **Step 4: Use the fact that angles BOC and DOC are supplementary.** Since angles BOC and DOC are supplementary, we can set up an equation:
    * Angle BOC + angle DOC = 180 degrees
    * 2x + 110 degrees = 180 degrees

        * We can see two right triangles in the diagram: triangle ABC and triangle ABD. 
        * We know that the length of BC is 3 (from the grid), and the length of AB is 4 (from the grid).

    * **Step 2: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**
        * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. 
        * We can use this theorem to find the length of AC (the hypotenuse of triangle ABC):
            * AC² = AB² + BC²
            * AC² = 4² + 3²

            * BD² = AB² - AD²
            * BD² = 4² - AD²
            * BD² = 16 - AD²

    * **Step 4: Find the Length of CD**

    * **Step 5: Use the Pythagorean Theorem on Triangle ACD**
        * We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle ACD to find the length of AD:
            * AC² = AD² + CD²
            * 5² = AD² + (3 - √(16 - AD²))²
            * 25 = AD² + 9 - 6√(16 - AD²) + (16 - AD²)

2. **Cracking the Code:**

    * **Understanding Medians and Midpoints:** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  A midpoint divides a line segment into two equal parts.

    * **Area of a Triangle:** The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula:  Area = (1/2) * base * height.

    * **Applying the Concepts:**
        * Since E is the midpoint of AD, AE = ED.
        * Since AD is the median of triangle ABC, BD = DC.
        * Therefore, triangles ABE and ADE share the same height (the perpendicular distance from E to AB).
        * Since AE = ED, the bases of triangles ABE and ADE are equal.
        * This means the areas of triangles ABE and ADE are equal.

    * **Solving for the Area of Triangle ABD:**
        * We know the area of triangle ABE is 2.
        * Since the area of triangle ADE is equal to the area of triangle ABE, the area of triangle ADE is also 2.
        * The area of triangle ABD is the sum of the areas of triangles ABE and ADE, so the area of triangle ABD is 2 + 2 = 4.

    * **Applying the Theorem:** In our problem, we know the hypotenuse (c = 15) and one leg (a = 9). We need to find the other leg (x).  Let's plug these values into the Pythagorean Theorem: 9² + x² = 15²

    * **Solving for x:**

2. **Cracking the Code:**

    * **Understanding Scale Factor:** The scale factor is the ratio of corresponding side lengths in two similar figures. In this case, we need to find the ratio of the side length of the smaller figure (Q) to the corresponding side length of the larger figure (Q').

    * **Identifying Corresponding Sides:** The side length of Q is 5, and the corresponding side length of Q' is x + 15.

    * **Setting up the Ratio:** The scale factor is the ratio of the side length of Q to the side length of Q': 
    
    Scale Factor = (Side Length of Q) / (Side Length of Q') = 5 / (x + 15)

    * **Finding x:**  We can use the fact that the two figures are similar to find x.  Since the corresponding sides are proportional, we can set up a proportion:

    5 / (x + 15) = 5 / 15

    * **Solving for x:**  Cross-multiplying, we get:

2. **Cracking the Code:**

* **Understanding the Incenter:** The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. It is also the center of the inscribed circle of the triangle.  

* **Key Property:**  The incenter of a triangle is equidistant from the sides of the triangle. This means that the distance from the incenter to each side is the same.

* **Using the Property:**  Since $Q$ is the incenter, we know that $QP = QM = QN$. We are given that $QM = 9$, so $QP = QN = 9$.

    * AB = 6
    * DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB (meaning it cuts AB in half at a right angle)
    * The perimeter of triangle ACE is 13

2. **Cracking the Code:**

    * **Understanding the Properties:** Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = 3 (half of AB). Also, angle ADE and angle BDE are right angles.

    * **Using the Perimeter Information:** The perimeter of triangle ACE is the sum of its sides: AC + CE + AE = 13.

    * **Finding AC:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AC.  In right triangle ADE, we have:
        * AD = 3
        * AE is a side of triangle ACE, which we don't know yet.
        * DE is a side of triangle BDE, which we don't know yet.

        The Pythagorean theorem states: a² + b² = c², where a and b are the legs of a right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse.  Applying this to triangle ADE:
        * 3² + DE² = AE²

        * BD = 3
        * DE is the same as in triangle ADE.
        * BE is a side of triangle BCE, which we don't know yet.

        Applying the Pythagorean theorem:
        * 3² + DE² = BE²

    * **Connecting the Pieces:**  We know that CE = BE + BC.  We also know that BC = AB - AC.  Substituting these into the perimeter equation of triangle ACE:
        * AC + (BE + BC) + AE = 13
        * AC + (BE + (AB - AC)) + AE = 13
        * AC + BE + AB - AC + AE = 13
        * BE + AB + AE = 13

    * **Solving for BE and AE:**  We can now substitute the expressions we found for BE and AE using the Pythagorean theorem:
        * √(3² + DE²) + 6 + √(3² + DE²) = 13
        * 2√(9 + DE²) = 7
        * √(9 + DE²) = 3.5
        * 9 + DE² = 12.25
        * DE² = 3.25
        * DE = √3.25

    * **Finding AC and BC:**  Now that we know DE, we can find AC and BC using the Pythagorean theorem in triangles ADE and BDE:
        * AC = √(3² + (√3.25)²) = √(9 + 3.25) = √12.25 = 3.5

1. **The Puzzle:**  The problem asks us to find the length of line segment EF in parallelogram ABCD, given that AB = 3, AD = 4, and the angle bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCD intersect AD at points E and F respectively.

2. **Cracking the Code:**

    * **Understanding the Properties of Parallelograms:**  We know that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel. Therefore, AD = BC = 4 and AB = CD = 3.

    * **Angle Bisectors:**  An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.  Since BE bisects ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE. Similarly, CF bisects ∠BCD, so ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

    * **Using Alternate Interior Angles:**  Since AB || CD, we have ∠ABE = ∠CDE (alternate interior angles). Similarly, ∠BCF = ∠ADE.

    * **Combining the Information:**  Now we have:
        * ∠ABE = ∠CBE = ∠CDE
        * ∠BCF = ∠DCF = ∠ADE

    * **Identifying Similar Triangles:**  Triangles ABE and CDE are similar because they have two equal angles (∠ABE = ∠CDE and ∠BAE = ∠DCE). Similarly, triangles BCF and ADF are similar because they have two equal angles (∠BCF = ∠ADE and ∠CBF = ∠DAF).

    * **Using Proportions:**  Since triangles ABE and CDE are similar, we have the proportion: AE/DE = AB/CD = 3/3 = 1. This means AE = DE.

    * **Finding EF:**  Similarly, since triangles BCF and ADF are similar, we have the proportion: BF/AF = BC/AD = 4/4 = 1. This means BF = AF.

    * **Final Calculation:**  Since AE = DE and BF = AF, we have EF = (AE + DE) + (BF + AF) = 2AE + 2BF = 2(AE + BF) = 2(AD) = 2(4) = 8.

* **Using Angle Relationships:**  We can use the following angle relationships to solve the problem:

    * **Vertical Angles:** Vertical angles are opposite angles formed by the intersection of two lines. Vertical angles are always equal. In our diagram, angle AOD and angle BOC are vertical angles, so they are equal: ∠AOD = ∠BOC = 50°.

    * **Supplementary Angles:** Supplementary angles are two angles that add up to 180 degrees. In our diagram, angle AOE and angle EOB are supplementary angles: ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 180°.

* **Solving for Angle EOB:**

    1. **Find angle AOE:** Since OD bisects angle AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.  We also know that ∠AOD = 50°. Therefore, ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠DOE = 50° + 50° = 100°.

    2. **Find angle EOB:** We know that ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 180°.  We found that ∠AOE = 100°.  Therefore, ∠EOB = 180° - ∠AOE = 180° - 100° = 80°.

    * **Diameter as a Central Angle:**  An angle formed by a diameter of a circle is a central angle, and its measure is 180 degrees.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
    * ∠ADC intercepts arc AC.  Therefore, ∠ADC = 1/2 * measure of arc AC.
    * Since ∠ADC = 26 degrees, the measure of arc AC = 2 * 26 degrees = 52 degrees.

* **Step 2: Identify relevant geometric relationships.**  Since AM bisects angle BAC, we know that angles BAM and MAC are equal.  Since BM is perpendicular to AM, we know that angle BMA is a right angle.  We also know that N is the midpoint of BC, so BN = NC.

* **Step 3: Use the Pythagorean Theorem.**  Triangle BMN is a right triangle, so we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BM:  BM² = BN² - MN² = (BC/2)² - 2² = (BC/2)² - 4.

* **Step 4: Use the Angle Bisector Theorem.**  The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that a bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.  In our case, this means that AB/AC = BM/MC.

* **Step 5: Solve for AC.**  We know AB = 8 and BM = √((BC/2)² - 4).  We also know that MC = BC - BM.  Substituting these values into the equation from Step 4, we get:

8/AC = √((BC/2)² - 4) / (BC - √((BC/2)² - 4))

* **Step 6: Simplify the equation.**  To solve for AC, we need to simplify the equation.  We can start by cross-multiplying:

8(BC - √((BC/2)² - 4)) = AC√((BC/2)² - 4)

* **Step 7: Solve for BC.**  We can solve for BC by squaring both sides of the equation and then simplifying:

64(BC - √((BC/2)² - 4))² = AC²(BC/2)² - 4AC²

* **Step 5: Solve for ∠PAB and ∠PBA**
    * We know ∠PAB + ∠PBA = 130 degrees, and ∠PAB = ∠PBA.
    * Therefore, 2 * ∠PAB = 130 degrees.

        * We are given that angle BEC = 35 degrees.

    * **Step 2:  Apply angle addition postulates.**
        * Since angle FBD is divided into two equal parts by BE, we can write: angle FBD = angle FBE + angle EBD = 2 * angle FBE.
        * Similarly, angle ACD = angle ACE + angle ECD = 2 * angle ACE.

    * **Step 3:  Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.**
        * Angle FBD + angle ABD = 180 degrees (angles on a straight line).

        * Angle BAE = angle BAC - angle CAE = angle ACD - angle ACE = 2 * angle ACE - angle ACE = angle ACE.
        * Therefore, angle FAE = 2 * angle FBE - angle ABD + angle ACE.

    * **Area of an Equilateral Triangle:** The area of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula: 
        Area = (√3 / 4) * side²

If ∠AOF = 40°, what is the measure of ∠F?

2. **Cracking the Code:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
    * Since AB is a diameter, ∠AEB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem).
    * Since E is the midpoint of FEB, ∠FE = ∠EB.
    * ∠AOF = 40° is given.

* **Step 2: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**
    * In triangle AOF, ∠AOF + ∠OAF + ∠OFA = 180°.
    * Since ∠AOF = 40°, we have ∠OAF + ∠OFA = 140°.

* **Step 3: Use the inscribed angle theorem.**
    * ∠OFA is an inscribed angle subtending arc AF.
    * ∠AOB is a central angle subtending the same arc AF.
    * Therefore, ∠AOB = 2 * ∠OFA.

* **Step 4: Find ∠AOB.**
    * Since AB is a diameter, ∠AOB = 180°.

* **Step 5: Calculate ∠OFA.**
    * Using the relationship from Step 3, ∠OFA = ∠AOB / 2 = 180° / 2 = 90°.

* **Step 6: Find ∠OAF.**
    * From Step 2, ∠OAF + ∠OFA = 140°.
    * Substituting ∠OFA = 90°, we get ∠OAF = 140° - 90° = 50°.

* **Step 7: Apply the angle sum property of triangles again.**
    * In triangle AEF, ∠FAE + ∠FEA + ∠AFE = 180°.
    * We know ∠FAE = ∠OAF = 50° and ∠FEA = ∠FE = ∠EB (from Step 1).

* **Step 8: Use the fact that ∠AEB is a right angle.**
    * Since ∠AEB is a right angle, ∠FEA + ∠FEB = 90°.
    * Therefore, ∠FEA = 90° - ∠FEB.

* **Step 9: Substitute and solve for ∠F.**
    * Substituting the values from Steps 7 and 8 into the angle sum property of triangle AEF, we get:
        * 50° + (90° - ∠FEB) + ∠F = 180°
        * Simplifying, we get ∠F = ∠FEB - 40°.

* **Step 10: Use the fact that E is the midpoint of FEB.**
    * Since E is the midpoint of FEB, ∠FEB = 2 * ∠F.

* **Step 3: Find the Measure of Arc DE**
    * Since CD is a diameter, arc DE is a semicircle and measures 180 degrees.

* **Understanding the Problem:**  A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle (point K in this case).  We need to find the measure of any angle formed by two radii of the circle.

* **Key Relationship:**  Since the square is inscribed in the circle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square.

* **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Let's consider right triangle FGD.  Since FG is a radius of the circle and GD is half the side of the square, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of FD (which is also a radius of the circle).  Let's say the side of the square is 's'.  Then:

    *  FG = s/2 (half the side of the square)
    *  GD = s/2 (half the side of the square)
    *  FD² = FG² + GD²
    *  FD² = (s/2)² + (s/2)²
    *  FD² = s²/4 + s²/4
    *  FD² = s²/2
    *  FD = √(s²/2) = s/√2

* **Finding the Central Angle:**  Now, we know that FD is a radius of the circle.  Since the diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square, we can find the measure of the central angle using the following logic:

    *  The diagonal of the square (which is also the diameter of the circle) is √2 times the side of the square (s√2).
    *  The central angle subtended by the diameter is 180 degrees (a straight angle).

* **Understanding the Problem:** We are dealing with a circle and an inscribed angle. An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share a common endpoint on the circle's circumference. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

* **Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that subtends arc AB.  Therefore, the central angle ∠AOB, which also subtends arc AB, is twice the measure of ∠ACB.  So, ∠AOB = 2 * 25° = 50°.

* **Identifying the Relationship:**  ∠BAO is one of the angles in triangle ABO.  We know that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180°.  Therefore, ∠BAO + ∠ABO + ∠AOB = 180°.

* **Finding ∠ABO:**  Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal in length.  This means triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle, and ∠ABO = ∠BAO.

* **Solving for ∠BAO:**  Substituting the values we know into the equation from step 3, we get: ∠BAO + ∠BAO + 50° = 180°.  Combining like terms, we have 2∠BAO = 130°.  Dividing both sides by 2, we find ∠BAO = 65°.

    * **Angle Sum Property of a Triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
    * Angle A intercepts arc BC. Since AB is a diameter, arc BC is a semicircle, and its measure is 180 degrees.
    * Therefore, angle A = (1/2) * 180 degrees = 90 degrees.

* **Step 5: Analyze the Result**
    * An angle of 0 degrees means that line CD is actually coincident with line AD. This is because the tangent line at point C is perpendicular to the radius OC, and since AB is a diameter, OC is also perpendicular to AB.

    * **Step 1: Find angle A.**  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle A:
        * ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
        * ∠A + 58° + 90° = 180°
        * ∠A = 180° - 58° - 90° = 32°

    * **Step 2: Understand corresponding angles.**  When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal (a line that crosses them), corresponding angles are equal.  Angle 1 and angle A are corresponding angles because they occupy the same relative position at the intersection of the transversal and the parallel lines. Therefore:

2. **Cracking the Code:**

    * **Understanding Equilateral Triangles:** An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal in length.  This means that $QR = QS = RS$.

    * **Setting Up the Equation:** Since all sides are equal, we can set the expressions for the sides equal to each other:
        * $QR = QS$
        * $4x = 6x - 1$

2. **Cracking the Code:**

    * **Step 1: Identify Corresponding Angles**
        * Since lines l1 and l2 are parallel, angle 1 and the angle inside the triangle that is adjacent to angle 2 are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are equal in measure.
        * Therefore, the angle inside the triangle adjacent to angle 2 is also 76 degrees.

    * **Step 2: Apply Angle Sum Property of Triangles**
        * The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
        * In this triangle, we know one angle is 30 degrees and another is 76 degrees.
        * Let's call the unknown angle inside the triangle 'x'.
        * So, 30 + 76 + x = 180

    * **Step 3: Solve for x**
        * Combine the known angles: 106 + x = 180
        * Subtract 106 from both sides: x = 74 degrees

2. **Cracking the Code:**

    * **Understanding the Concept:** The center of mass of an object is the point where the object's mass is evenly distributed. For a symmetrical object like a triangle, the center of mass lies along its line of symmetry.

    * **Visualizing the Problem:** Imagine the triangle divided into infinitesimally small horizontal strips. Each strip has a small mass, and the center of mass of each strip lies at its midpoint.

    * **Setting up the Equation:** We can find the y-coordinate of the center of mass by taking the weighted average of the y-coordinates of all these strips.  The weight of each strip is proportional to its area.

        5. **Now, we can integrate to find the total mass and the weighted average of y-coordinates:**
            * **Total mass (M):**  ∫dm = ∫(k * 2y * dy) from 0 to a/2 = k * a^2 / 2
            * **Weighted average of y-coordinates:** ∫(y * dm) / M = ∫(y * k * 2y * dy) / (k * a^2 / 2) from 0 to a/2 = (2/a^2) * ∫(y^2 * dy) from 0 to a/2 = (2/a^2) * (a^3 / 24) = a/12

We know that the area of each square is 9.

2. **Cracking the Code:**

    * **Step 1: Find the side length of each square.**
        * The area of a square is calculated by side length * side length (s * s).

        * Since BE is perpendicular to AF, we know that angle BEF is a right angle (90 degrees).

    * **Step 2: Find Angle BAE**
        * We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
        * In triangle ABE, we have angle B = 65 degrees and angle BEF = 90 degrees.

2. **Cracking the Code:**

* **Understanding the Properties of a Regular Hexagon:** A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles.  The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is 720 degrees. Therefore, each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures 720/6 = 120 degrees.

* **Identifying Key Angles:**  Angle ABO is one-sixth of the interior angle of the hexagon, so angle ABO = 120/6 = 20 degrees.

* **Using the Angle Sum Property of a Triangle:**  Triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle (AB = BO). Therefore, angles BAO and BOA are equal.  The sum of the angles in triangle ABO is 180 degrees.  So, we have:
    *  Angle ABO + Angle BAO + Angle BOA = 180 degrees
    *  20 degrees + Angle BAO + Angle BOA = 180 degrees
    *  Angle BAO + Angle BOA = 160 degrees
    *  Since Angle BAO = Angle BOA, we have 2 * Angle BAO = 160 degrees

An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle.  The intercepted arc is the arc that lies inside the inscribed angle.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Cracking the Code:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
    *  Since DB and DC are tangents to the circle, we know that angles ODB and ODC are right angles (90 degrees). This is because a tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
    *  Angle AOB is a straight angle (180 degrees) because AB is a diameter.

* **Step 2: Apply angle properties.**
    *  Angle ABO is half of angle AOB (since AB is a diameter), so angle ABO = 180/2 = 90 degrees.
    *  Angle OBC is the difference between angle ABO and angle ABC, so angle OBC = 90 - angle ABC.
    *  Angle ACB is half of angle AOB (since AB is a diameter), so angle ACB = 180/2 = 90 degrees.
    *  Angle BCD is the difference between angle ACB and angle ACE, so angle BCD = 90 - 25 = 65 degrees.

* **Step 3: Use the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.**
    *  In triangle BCD, angle BCD + angle CBD + angle BDC = 180 degrees.

    * We know one side is 16 ft long.
    * We know the base is 23 ft long.
    * We need to find the length of the other side.

* **Step 2: Use trigonometry to find the length of the other side.**
    * We can use the sine function (sin) to find the length of the other side.
    * The sine function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle.
    * In this case, the opposite side is the length of the other side of the parallelogram, and the hypotenuse is the base of the parallelogram (23 ft).
    * The angle we are using is 60 degrees.
    * The formula for sine is: sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse
    * Plugging in the values, we get: sin(60°) = opposite / 23 ft
    * Solving for the opposite side, we get: opposite = sin(60°) * 23 ft
    * Using a calculator, we find that sin(60°) = 0.866
    * Therefore, the opposite side is: 0.866 * 23 ft = 19.9 ft (approximately)

        * **Tangent-Radius Property:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.

* **Understanding the Geometry:**  We need to use the Intersecting Chords Theorem and the Tangent-Secant Theorem to solve this problem.

    * **Intersecting Chords Theorem:**  If two chords intersect inside a circle, then the product of the lengths of the segments of one chord is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the other chord.
    * **Tangent-Secant Theorem:**  If a tangent and a secant are drawn to a circle from an external point, then the square of the length of the tangent is equal to the product of the lengths of the secant and its external segment.

* **Applying the Theorems:**

    * **Tangent-Secant Theorem:**  We can use the Tangent-Secant Theorem to find the length of the entire secant (12 + *x*).  Since the tangent has a length of 12, we have:
        12² = (12 + *x*) * 8
    * **Simplifying the Equation:**
        144 = 96 + 8*x
        48 = 8*x
        *x* = 6

3. **The Solution:**  The length of segment *x* is 6.

2. **Cracking the Code:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
    *  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, ∠ACB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem: an inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle is a right angle).
    *  We are given that ∠ABD = 50°.

* **Step 2: Apply angle relationships in triangles.**
    *  In triangle ABD, we have ∠BAD = 90° (since AB is a diameter) and ∠ABD = 50°.  Therefore, ∠ADB = 180° - 90° - 50° = 40° (angle sum property of triangles).

* **Step 3: Utilize the fact that angles subtended by the same arc are equal.**
    *  ∠ADB and ∠ACB both intercept arc AB. Therefore, ∠ACB = ∠ADB = 40°.

* **Step 4: Calculate ∠BCD.**
    *  In triangle BCD, we have ∠BCD = 180° - ∠CBD - ∠CDB (angle sum property of triangles).
    *  ∠CBD = ∠ABD = 50° (angles subtended by the same arc AB).
    *  ∠CDB = ∠ADB = 40°.
    *  Therefore, ∠BCD = 180° - 50° - 40° = 90°.

2. **Cracking the Code:**

    * **Understanding the Problem:** We are dealing with a circle, where the center is point S.  The arc PQR is a major arc, meaning it's larger than 180 degrees.  We need to find the measure of the minor arc PQ, which is smaller than 180 degrees.

    * **Key Concept:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  In this case, the central angle that intercepts arc PQR is also 98 degrees.

    * **Circle Properties:** A circle has 360 degrees.  Therefore, the measure of the minor arc PQ plus the measure of the major arc PQR must equal 360 degrees.

    * **Setting up the Equation:** Let x represent the measure of minor arc PQ.  We can write the equation: x + 98 = 360

    * **Solving for x:**
        * Subtract 98 from both sides of the equation: x = 360 - 98
        * Simplify: x = 262

2. **Cracking the Code:**

* **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**  Angle bisectors divide an angle into two equal angles. Therefore, ∠ACD = ∠BCD and ∠ABE = ∠CBE.

* **Finding ∠ACB:** Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we have a right angle at G: ∠CGD = 90°.  We know ∠ACG = 32°.  Therefore, we can find ∠ACD using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°: ∠ACD = 180° - 90° - 32° = 58°.

* **Finding ∠BCD:** Since CD is an angle bisector, ∠BCD = ∠ACD = 58°.

* **Finding ∠ABC:**  We know ∠ACD = 58° and ∠ABE = ∠CBE.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, we can find ∠ABC: ∠ABC = 180° - 58° - 58° = 64°.

* **Finding ∠BFC:**  We know ∠BFC is an interior angle of triangle BFC.  We can find it using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°: ∠BFC = 180° - ∠FBC - ∠FCB.  We know ∠FBC = 1/2 * ∠ABC = 1/2 * 64° = 32° and ∠FCB = 1/2 * ∠ACB = 1/2 * 116° = 58°.  Therefore, ∠BFC = 180° - 32° - 58° = 90°.

2. **Cracking the Code:**

* **Understanding the Properties of Regular Polygons:** A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal.  
* **Central Angle of a Regular Polygon:** The central angle of a regular polygon is the angle formed by connecting the center of the polygon to two consecutive vertices.  The measure of a central angle of a regular polygon is found by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides.  In this case, the central angle of the pentagon is 360 degrees / 5 sides = 72 degrees.
* **Angle at the Center:**  Angle AOE is a central angle of the pentagon, so its measure is 72 degrees.
* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle ADE is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AE.
* **Arc Measure:** The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle.  Arc AE is intercepted by central angle AOE, so its measure is 72 degrees.
* **Calculating Angle ADE:**  Since angle ADE is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AE, its measure is half the measure of arc AE.  Therefore, angle ADE = 72 degrees / 2 = 36 degrees.

We know that one angle is 70 degrees, and the other two angles are represented by *x* and *y*.

2. **Cracking the Code:**

    * **Step 1: Identify the relationship between the angles.** The angles represented by *x*, *y*, and 70 degrees form a straight angle. A straight angle always measures 180 degrees.

    * **Step 2: Set up an equation.** We can write the equation: *x* + *y* + 70 = 180

    * **Step 3: Simplify the equation.**  Subtracting 70 from both sides, we get: *x* + *y* = 110

    * **Step 4: Substitute the given information.** We know that *y* = *x*². Substituting this into the equation, we get: *x* + *x*² = 110

    * **Step 5: Rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation.**  *x*² + *x* - 110 = 0

    * **Step 6: Solve the quadratic equation.** We can factor the equation as (*x* + 11)(*x* - 10) = 0. This gives us two possible solutions: *x* = -11 or *x* = 10.

    * **Step 7: Choose the valid solution.** Since angles cannot be negative, we discard *x* = -11. Therefore, *x* = 10.

    * **Step 8: Calculate the value of y.** We know that *y* = *x*². Substituting *x* = 10, we get *y* = 10² = 100.
