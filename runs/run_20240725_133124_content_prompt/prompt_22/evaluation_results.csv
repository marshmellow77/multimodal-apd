**Step 1: Understand the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.**

An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.

**Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.

**Step 3: Identify the corresponding central angle.**

In this case, ∠ABC is the inscribed angle, and its corresponding central angle is ∠AOC.

**Step 4: Calculate the measure of ∠AOC.**

Since ∠ABC = 70°, and the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle, we have:

Since angles AOD and BOD are supplementary angles, we have:

∠AOD + ∠BOD = 180°

Substituting the given value of ∠AOD, we get:

* q4 = 200 nC at (a, 0)

The distance between each particle is 'a' = 5.0 cm.

We need to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.

**Step 1: Calculate the force between each pair of particles.**

The electrostatic force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's Law:

F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2

where:

* k is Coulomb's constant (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
* q1 and q2 are the charges of the two particles
* r is the distance between the two particles

Let's calculate the force between each pair of particles:

* **Force between q1 and q3 (F13):**
    * F13 = k * |q1 * q3| / a^2
    * F13 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * |(-100 × 10^-9 C) * (-200 × 10^-9 C)| / (0.05 m)^2
    * F13 = 0.719 N (attractive force, directed towards q1)

* **Force between q2 and q3 (F23):**
    * F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / (√2 * a)^2
    * F23 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * |(100 × 10^-9 C) * (-200 × 10^-9 C)| / (√2 * 0.05 m)^2
    * F23 = 0.3595 N (repulsive force, directed away from q2)

* **Force between q4 and q3 (F43):**
    * F43 = k * |q4 * q3| / a^2
    * F43 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * |(200 × 10^-9 C) * (-200 × 10^-9 C)| / (0.05 m)^2
    * F43 = 1.439 N (repulsive force, directed away from q4)

**Step 2: Resolve the forces into their x-components.**

* **F13:** The force F13 is directed along the y-axis, so its x-component is 0.

* **F23:** The force F23 is directed at 45 degrees to the x-axis. Its x-component is:
    * F23x = F23 * cos(45°) = 0.3595 N * cos(45°) = 0.254 N (directed towards the right)

* **F43:** The force F43 is directed along the x-axis, so its x-component is:
    * F43x = F43 = 1.439 N (directed towards the right)

**Step 3: Calculate the net x-component of the force.**

The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of all the forces:

* Fnetx = F13x + F23x + F43x
* Fnetx = 0 + 0.254 N + 1.439 N

Angles 1 and 14 are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal intersects two parallel lines. They are located in the same relative position at each intersection.

The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the corresponding angles are congruent.

If PA = 8.0, then perimeter of △PCD is ()",16,"The image shows a circle with center O, and two tangents PA and PB drawn from an external point P. Points C and D are on PA and PB respectively, and CD is tangent to the circle. We are given that PA = 8.0 and asked to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Understanding Tangent Properties:**
   - Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.
   - The radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent. This means OA is perpendicular to PA and OB is perpendicular to PB.

2. **Constructing Key Shapes:**
   - Draw radii OA and OB.
   - Connect points O, C, and D.

3. **Analyzing Triangles:**
   - Triangles OAC and OBC are right-angled triangles (due to the tangent property).
   - Triangles OAC and OBC are congruent (by the Hypotenuse-Leg congruence theorem: OA = OB, AC = BC).

4. **Finding the Perimeter:**
   - Perimeter of △PCD = PC + CD + PD.
   - Since AC = BC, PC = PA - AC = PB - BC = PD.
   - Therefore, Perimeter of △PCD = PC + CD + PD = 2PC + CD.
   - We need to find PC and CD.

5. **Finding PC:**
   - In right-angled triangle OAC, OA is the radius of the circle (let's assume it's 'r').
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem: AC² = PA² - OA² = 8² - r² = 64 - r².
   - PC = PA - AC = 8 - √(64 - r²).

6. **Finding CD:**
   - CD is the sum of the lengths of the two tangents drawn from point C to the circle.
   - Since tangents from a point to a circle are equal, CD = 2 * OC.
   - In right-angled triangle OAC, OC² = OA² + AC² = r² + (64 - r²) = 64.
   - Therefore, OC = √64 = 8, and CD = 2 * OC = 16.

7. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   - Perimeter of △PCD = 2PC + CD = 2(8 - √(64 - r²)) + 16 = 32 - 2√(64 - r²).

**Therefore, the perimeter of triangle PCD is 32 - 2√(64 - r²), where 'r' is the radius of the circle.** 

**Note:** The exact value of the perimeter cannot be determined without knowing the radius of the circle.

We are given that:

* D is a point inside triangle ABC.
* CD bisects angle ACB.
* BD is perpendicular to CD.
* Angle A is equal to angle ABD.
* Angle DBC is 54 degrees.

**Step 2: Find the measure of angle ACD.**

Since CD bisects angle ACB, we have:

∠ACD = ∠BCD = 1/2 * ∠ACB

**Step 3: Find the measure of angle BDC.**

Since BD is perpendicular to CD, we have:

∠BDC = 90 degrees

**Step 4: Find the measure of angle ADB.**

We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle BDC:

∠DBC + ∠BDC + ∠BCD = 180 degrees

Substituting the known values:

54 degrees + 90 degrees + ∠BCD = 180 degrees

**Step 1: Understand the properties of medians**

A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  A key property of medians is that they divide the triangle into two triangles with equal areas.

**Step 2: Apply the property to the given triangle**

Since AD is a median of triangle ABC, we know that the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD.

**Step 3: Relate the areas of triangles ABE and ABD**

Since E is the midpoint of AD, we know that AE = ED.  Therefore, triangle ABE and triangle ABD share the same base (AB) and the same height (the perpendicular distance from D to AB).  This means that the area of triangle ABE is half the area of triangle ABD.

**Step 4: Calculate the area of triangle ABD**

We are given that the area of triangle ABE is 2. Since the area of triangle ABD is twice the area of triangle ABE, the area of triangle ABD is 2 * 2 = 4.

The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that a bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.  In this case, we have:

$$\frac{JQ}{QN} = \frac{JL}{LN}$$

We know that $JL = 16.5$ and $LN = 9 + QM$.  To find $QM$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $QMN$:

$$QM = \sqrt{QN^2 - MN^2}$$

We don't know $QN$ or $MN$, but we can use the fact that $Q$ is the incenter to find them.  The incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle, so $QN = QM$ and $QN = QP$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $QNP$ to find $QP$:

$$QP = \sqrt{QN^2 - NP^2}$$

We don't know $NP$, but we can use the fact that $P$ is the foot of the altitude from $N$ to $\overline{JL}$ to find it.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $JNP$:

$$NP = \sqrt{JN^2 - JP^2}$$

We know that $JN = 16.5$ and $JP = 16.5 - QP$.  Substituting this into the equation for $NP$, we get:

$$NP = \sqrt{16.5^2 - (16.5 - QP)^2}$$

Now we can substitute this into the equation for $QP$:

$$QP = \sqrt{QN^2 - \left(\sqrt{16.5^2 - (16.5 - QP)^2}\right)^2}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$QP = \sqrt{QN^2 - (16.5^2 - (16.5 - QP)^2)}$$

We can solve this equation for $QP$ to get:

$$QP = \frac{16.5^2}{2 \cdot 16.5} = 8.25$$

Now we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $QNP$ to find $QN$:

$$QN = \sqrt{QP^2 + NP^2} = \sqrt{8.25^2 + \left(\sqrt{16.5^2 - (16.5 - 8.25)^2}\right)^2} = 13.75$$

Now we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $QMN$ to find $QM$:

$$QM = \sqrt{QN^2 - MN^2} = \sqrt{13.75^2 - 9^2} = 10.5$$

Now we can find $LN$:

$$LN = 9 + QM = 9 + 10.5 = 19.5$$

1. **Understanding Perpendicular Bisectors:** A perpendicular bisector of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts and is perpendicular to the segment. Therefore, AD = DB = 3.

2. **Using the Perimeter Information:** The perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, meaning AC + CE + AE = 13.

The angle bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCD intersect AD at points E and F, respectively. We are given that AB = 3 and AD = 4, and we need to find the length of EF.

**Step 1: Understand the properties of parallelograms and angle bisectors.**

* **Parallelogram properties:** Opposite sides are equal and parallel, opposite angles are equal, and diagonals bisect each other.
* **Angle bisector property:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.

**Step 2: Apply the angle bisector property.**

Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE. Similarly, since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, we have ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

**Step 3: Use the properties of parallelograms to find angles.**

* Since AB || CD, we have ∠ABE = ∠CDE (alternate interior angles).
* Since BC || AD, we have ∠CBE = ∠CED (alternate interior angles).

**Step 4: Combine the information to find angles.**

From steps 2 and 3, we have:
* ∠ABE = ∠CBE = ∠CDE = ∠CED

**Step 5: Identify similar triangles.**

Triangles ABE and CDE are similar because they have three equal angles.

**Step 6: Use the similarity ratio to find EF.**

Since triangles ABE and CDE are similar, we have the following proportion:

AE/DE = AB/CD

Since AB = CD (opposite sides of parallelogram), we have AE = DE.

Therefore, EF = AE - AF = DE - AF = (AD/2) - AF = (4/2) - AF = 2 - AF.

**Step 7: Find AF.**

Since triangles ABF and CDF are similar (same reasoning as step 5), we have the following proportion:

AF/DF = AB/CD

Since AB = CD, we have AF = DF.

Therefore, AF = (AD/2) = (4/2) = 2.

**Step 8: Calculate EF.**

From step 6, we have EF = 2 - AF = 2 - 2 = 0.

Line OD bisects angle AOE, and angle BOC is given as 50 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle EOB.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Understanding Bisectors:** Since OD bisects angle AOE, it means that angle AOD is equal to angle DOE.

2. **Vertical Angles:** Angles BOC and AOD are vertical angles, meaning they are equal. Therefore, angle AOD = 50 degrees.

3. **Linear Pair:** Angles AOD and DOE form a linear pair, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. So, angle DOE = 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees.

* We are given that ∠ADC = 26°.
* We know that AB is the diameter of the circle, which means that ∠ACB is a right angle (90°).
* We need to find the measure of ∠CAB.

**Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

* The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* In this case, ∠ADC intercepts arc AC. Therefore, the measure of arc AC is 2 * ∠ADC = 2 * 26° = 52°.

* A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle.
* The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
* Since ∠ACB is a central angle intercepting arc AC, its measure is 52°.

**Step 4: Use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°.**

* In triangle ABC, we have:

The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, we have:

**Step 1: Draw a diameter through point C.**

Since angle C is 30 degrees, the central angle subtended by chord AC is 60 degrees (twice the inscribed angle). This means triangle AOC is a 30-60-90 triangle.

**Step 2: Use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle.**

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is √3 times the length of the shorter leg.

Since the radius of the circle is 2, the hypotenuse of triangle AOC is 2. Therefore, the shorter leg (AC) is 1, and the longer leg (OC) is √3.

**Step 3: Find the length of chord AB.**

Since triangle AOC is isosceles (AC = AO), angle OAC is also 30 degrees. Therefore, angle AOB is 120 degrees (360 - 60 - 60 - 120 = 0).

Triangle AOB is also isosceles (AO = BO), so angle ABO is 30 degrees. This means triangle AOB is a 30-60-90 triangle.

Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, we can find the length of AB:

* The shorter leg (AB) is half the length of the hypotenuse (AO).

   - Angle BAC becomes angle B'AC' (both are right angles).
   - Line segment AB becomes line segment AB' (they are perpendicular).
   - Line segment AC becomes line segment AC' (they are perpendicular).

   - Similarly, ∠ACE = ∠ECD = (1/2)∠ACD.
   - The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so in triangle BEC, we have ∠BEC + ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 180°.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Recognize that triangle ADE is a right triangle.** This is because DE is perpendicular to AB.

2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AE.** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

3. **Recognize that triangle ADC is also a right triangle.** This is because AD is perpendicular to BC.

4. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of DC.** In this case, DC is the hypotenuse, AD is one leg, and AC is the other leg. So, we have:
