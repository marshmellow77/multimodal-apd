643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem Summary:

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle C in a circle, given that the diameter CD is perpendicular to chord DE, and the measure of angle D is 50 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Relationships:**  We know that the diameter of a circle divides it into two equal semicircles.  Since DE is parallel to OA, we have two parallel lines cut by a transversal (CD).  This means that the corresponding angles are equal.  So, ∠D = ∠A = 50 degrees.

2. **Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Since ∠C intercepts the entire semicircle, its measure is half the measure of the semicircle, which is 180 degrees.

3. **Calculating ∠C:**  Therefore, ∠C = 180 degrees / 2 = 90 degrees.

## The Answer:

The degree of ∠C is **90**.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## Problem Summary:

This problem asks us to find the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) of a right triangle, given one of the other sides and one of the angles.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the sides:** We know the length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle (which is 4), and we want to find the length of the hypotenuse (which is *h*).

2. **Choose the right trigonometric function:** Since we know the opposite side and want to find the hypotenuse, we'll use the sine function.  The sine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse.  We can write this as a formula:

   *  sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse

3. **Plug in the values:** We know the angle is 60 degrees, the opposite side is 4, and the hypotenuse is *h*.  Let's plug these values into our formula:

   * sin(60°) = 4 / *h*

4. **Solve for *h*:** To get *h* by itself, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by *h* and then divide both sides by sin(60°):

   * *h* * sin(60°) = 4
   * *h* = 4 / sin(60°)

5. **Calculate the answer:**  We know that sin(60°) = √3 / 2.  Let's plug that in and simplify:

   * *h* = 4 / (√3 / 2)
   * *h* = 4 * (2 / √3)
   * *h* = 8 / √3

6. **Rationalize the denominator:** To make the answer look nicer, we can get rid of the square root in the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by √3:

   * *h* = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
   * *h* = 8√3 / 3

## The Answer:

The length of the hypotenuse, *h*, is **8√3 / 3**.

887,"As shown in the figure, △ABC is the inscribed triangle of ⊙O. If ∠ABC = 70.0, then the degree of ∠AOC is equal to ()",140°,"## Problem Summary:

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle AOC, given that angle ABC is 70 degrees and triangle ABC is inscribed in circle O.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Inscribed Angles:**  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share the same endpoint.  The important thing to remember is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

2. **Identifying the Central Angle:**  In our problem, angle ABC is the inscribed angle, and angle AOC is the central angle that intercepts the same arc (arc AC).

3. **Applying the Formula:**  Since the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle, we can write:

   ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC

4. **Solving for ∠AOC:**  We know that ∠ABC = 70 degrees.  Plugging this into our formula, we get:

   ∠AOC = 2 * 70° = 140°

This problem asks us to find the area of a trapezoid. 

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the bases and height:**  The bases of a trapezoid are the two parallel sides. In this case, the bases are 41 ft and 53 ft. The height is the perpendicular distance between the bases, which is 48 ft.

2. **Use the formula for the area of a trapezoid:** The formula is: 
   Area = (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2)

3. **Plug in the values:**

610,"In the figure above, P, Q, and R lie on the same line. P is the center of the larger circle, and Q is the center of the smaller circle. If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"## Problem Summary:

This problem asks us to find the radius of the smaller circle, given that the radius of the larger circle is 4 and that the centers of both circles lie on the same line.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Visualize:** Imagine drawing a line segment from point P (center of the larger circle) to point R (on the edge of the larger circle). This line segment is the radius of the larger circle, which we know is 4.

2. **Connect the dots:** Now, imagine drawing another line segment from point Q (center of the smaller circle) to point R. This line segment is the radius of the smaller circle.

3. **The key:** Notice that the line segment PQ is the difference between the radius of the larger circle and the radius of the smaller circle.  

4. **The formula:** Since the line segment PQ is also a radius of the larger circle, we can write this as:  Radius of larger circle - Radius of smaller circle = Radius of larger circle.

5. **Solve for the unknown:** Let's call the radius of the smaller circle ""r"".  We can now write the equation: 4 - r = 4.

6. **Isolate the variable:** To solve for ""r"", we need to get it by itself.  Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: 4 - r - 4 = 4 - 4.  This simplifies to -r = 0.

7. **Final step:**  Multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to get rid of the negative sign: -1 * -r = 0 * -1.  This gives us r = 0.

## The Answer:

The radius of the smaller circle is **0**.

198,Calculate the missing value.,1,"# Problem Summary:

This problem shows us four triangles, each with three numbers.  We need to figure out the pattern and use it to find the missing number in the last triangle.

# Solution Breakdown:

Let's look at the first triangle.  The numbers are 6, 2, and 2.  If we add the two bottom numbers (6 + 2), we get 8.  Then, if we divide that sum by 2, we get 4.  The top number in the triangle is 2, which is half of 4.

Let's try that pattern with the second triangle.  The bottom numbers are 1 and 3.  Adding them together gives us 4.  Dividing by 2 gives us 2.  The top number is 4, which is double 2.

The third triangle has bottom numbers of 2 and 5.  Adding them gives us 7.  Dividing by 2 gives us 3.5.  The top number is 3, which is close to 3.5.  It seems like the pattern is to add the bottom numbers, divide by 2, and then round the result to the nearest whole number.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the last triangle.  The bottom numbers are 1 and 0.  Adding them gives us 1.  Dividing by 2 gives us 0.5.  Rounding 0.5 to the nearest whole number gives us 1.

This problem shows us two lines intersecting at a point, and asks us to find the measure of angle AOE, given that angle AOD is 70 degrees and line OE bisects angle BOC.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the problem:** We know that line OE bisects angle BOC, which means it divides angle BOC into two equal angles.  We also know that angles AOD and BOC are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.

2. **Finding angle BOC:** Since angles AOD and BOC are supplementary, we can find angle BOC by subtracting angle AOD from 180 degrees: 
   *  ∠BOC = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°

3. **Finding angle BOE:**  Since OE bisects angle BOC, angle BOE is half of angle BOC:
   * ∠BOE = ∠BOC / 2 = 110° / 2 = 55°

4. **Finding angle AOE:**  Angles AOE and BOE are adjacent angles, meaning they share a common side (OE) and form a straight angle (180 degrees).  We can find angle AOE by subtracting angle BOE from 180 degrees:

This problem asks us to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3, which is located at the bottom left corner of a square.  We're given the charges of each particle and the distance between them.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the forces acting on particle 3:** Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces from particles 1, 2, and 4.  Let's call these forces F13, F23, and F43, respectively.

2. **Calculate the force between each pair of particles:** We can use Coulomb's Law to calculate the force between any two charged particles:

   * **Coulomb's Law:**  F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
      * F is the force between the two charges
      * k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
      * q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges
      * r is the distance between the charges

3. **Determine the x-component of each force:**  We need to find the x-component of each force because we're only interested in the net force in the x-direction.

   * **F13:**  The force between particle 1 and particle 3 is purely in the y-direction, so its x-component is 0.
   * **F23:** The force between particle 2 and particle 3 is diagonal, so we need to use trigonometry to find its x-component.  The angle between the force and the x-axis is 45 degrees.  The x-component of F23 is F23 * cos(45°).
   * **F43:** The force between particle 4 and particle 3 is purely in the x-direction, so its x-component is simply F43.

4. **Add the x-components of all the forces:**  The net force in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of all the forces acting on particle 3.

## The Answer:

After calculating the x-components of each force and adding them together, the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is approximately **-1.80 x 10^-2 N**.  The negative sign indicates that the net force is directed to the left.

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle J in a right triangle, given the lengths of the hypotenuse and one leg.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We know the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) and one leg (the side adjacent to angle J).  The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is the cosine.  So, we'll use the cosine function.

2. **Write the equation:**  The cosine of an angle is equal to the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse.  In this case, we have:

   cos(J) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = 9 / 14

3. **Solve for angle J:** To find the measure of angle J, we need to use the inverse cosine function (also called arccosine), which is denoted as cos⁻¹ or arccos.

This problem shows a right triangle ABC inside a 4x4 grid.  We need to find the length of the line segment AD, which is the altitude drawn from point A to the hypotenuse BC.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Count the Grid Squares:**  Let's start by counting the grid squares to find the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC.  
   *  AB has a length of 4 units (4 grid squares).
   *  BC has a length of 3 units (3 grid squares).
   *  AC has a length of 5 units (5 grid squares).

2. **Recognize the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Notice that triangle ABC has a special relationship: 3² + 4² = 5².  This means triangle ABC is a right triangle, and we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of AD.

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We can write this as:  a² + b² = c², where 'c' is the hypotenuse and 'a' and 'b' are the other two sides.

4. **Find the Area of Triangle ABC:**  We can also find the area of triangle ABC in two ways:
   *  Using the base BC and the height AD:  Area = (1/2) * BC * AD
   *  Using the base AB and the height AC:  Area = (1/2) * AB * AC

5. **Set the Areas Equal:** Since both methods calculate the same area, we can set them equal to each other:
   (1/2) * BC * AD = (1/2) * AB * AC

6. **Solve for AD:**  Now we can plug in the values we know and solve for AD:
   (1/2) * 3 * AD = (1/2) * 4 * 5
   3 * AD = 20
   AD = 20/3

This problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle PCD, given that PA and PB are tangents to circle O, and CD is tangent to circle O. We also know that PA = 8.0.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Tangents:**  Remember that a tangent line to a circle touches the circle at exactly one point.  The important thing to know about tangents is that they are always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  So, OA is perpendicular to PA, and OB is perpendicular to PB.

2. **Equal Tangent Segments:**  Another important property of tangents is that if two tangents are drawn from the same external point, then the segments of the tangents from the external point to the points of tangency are equal.  This means that  PA = PB = 8.0.

3. **Finding the Perimeter:**  The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides.  So, the perimeter of triangle PCD is PC + CD + PD.  Since PA = PB, and PC and PD are parts of PA and PB respectively, we can say that PC + PD = PA = 8.0.  Now, we just need to find CD.

4. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Triangle OAC is a right triangle (because OA is perpendicular to PA).  We know that OA is the radius of the circle, and AC is half of PA (because C is the midpoint of PA).  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of OA:  OA² + AC² = OC².  Since AC = PA/2 = 8.0/2 = 4.0, and OC is the radius of the circle, we can find OA.  Let's say the radius of the circle is r.  Then, r² + 4² = OC².  

5. **Finding CD:**  Similarly, triangle ODB is also a right triangle.  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find OB:  OB² + BD² = OD².  Since BD = PB/2 = 8.0/2 = 4.0, and OD is also the radius of the circle (r), we can find OB:  r² + 4² = OD².

6. **Putting it Together:**  Now, we know that OC = OD (both are radii of the circle).  Therefore, CD = OC - OD = 0.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle A in triangle ABC, given that point D is inside the triangle, CD bisects angle ACB, BD is perpendicular to CD, angle A equals angle ABD, and angle DBC is 54 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the problem:** We have a triangle ABC with a point D inside. We know that CD divides angle ACB into two equal angles. We also know that BD is perpendicular to CD, meaning they form a 90-degree angle.  We're given that angle A is equal to angle ABD, and angle DBC is 54 degrees.

2. **Finding angles:** Since CD bisects angle ACB, we know that angle ACD = angle BCD.  Let's call this angle x.

3. **Using the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees:** In triangle BCD, we have:
   * angle BCD = x
   * angle BDC = 90 degrees (because BD is perpendicular to CD)
   * angle DBC = 54 degrees (given)

   Therefore, x + 90 + 54 = 180.  Solving for x, we get x = 36 degrees.

4. **Using the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees:**  Angle ACB is a straight angle, so:
   * angle ACB = angle ACD + angle BCD = 36 + 36 = 72 degrees.

5. **Using the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees:** In triangle ABC, we have:
   * angle A = angle ABD (given)
   * angle ABC = angle ABD + angle DBC = angle A + 54 degrees
   * angle ACB = 72 degrees (calculated above)

   Therefore, angle A + (angle A + 54) + 72 = 180.  Solving for angle A, we get angle A = 27 degrees.

This problem shows a triangle ABC with a median AD and a point E that is the midpoint of AD.  We know the area of triangle ABE is 2, and we need to find the area of triangle ABC.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Medians:** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  In this case, AD is a median because D is the midpoint of BC.

2. **Key Relationship:**  The median of a triangle divides the triangle into two triangles with equal areas.  This means the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD.

3. **Applying the Relationship:** Since E is the midpoint of AD, we can apply the same principle again.  The area of triangle ABE is equal to the area of triangle AED.  We know the area of triangle ABE is 2, so the area of triangle AED is also 2.

4. **Finding the Area of Triangle ABD:**  The area of triangle ABD is the sum of the areas of triangles ABE and AED.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABD is 2 + 2 = 4.

5. **Finding the Area of Triangle ABC:**  Since the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD, the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle ABD.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 4 * 2 = 8.

The problem asks us to find the length of line segment $JQ$ in triangle $JLN$, given that point $Q$ is the incenter of the triangle.

# Solution Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Incenter:** The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  This means that line segments $JQ$, $KQ$, and $LQ$ all bisect the angles of triangle $JLN$.

2. **Using the Incenter Property:**  A key property of the incenter is that it is equidistant from the sides of the triangle.  This means that the perpendicular distances from the incenter to each side of the triangle are equal.  In our problem, this means that $QP = QM = QK$.

3. **Focusing on Triangle JQP:**  We know the length of $JP$ is 16.5.  We need to find the length of $JQ$.  Since $QP = QK$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $QK$.  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

4. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**  In triangle $JQP$, $JP$ is the hypotenuse, and $JQ$ and $QP$ are the other two sides.  So, we have:

   $JP^2 = JQ^2 + QP^2$

   We know $JP = 16.5$ and we want to find $JQ$.  We can rearrange the equation to solve for $JQ$:

   $JQ^2 = JP^2 - QP^2$

   We need to find $QP$.  Since $QP = QK$, we can use triangle $KQM$ to find $QK$.  We know $KM = 9$ and $QM = QK$.  Using the Pythagorean theorem again:

   $KM^2 = QM^2 + QK^2$

   $9^2 = QK^2 + QK^2$

   $81 = 2QK^2$

   $QK^2 = 40.5$

   $QK = \sqrt{40.5}$

   Since $QP = QK$, we have $QP = \sqrt{40.5}$.

5. **Finding JQ:** Now we can plug the values of $JP$ and $QP$ into the equation we derived earlier:

   $JQ^2 = JP^2 - QP^2$

   $JQ^2 = 16.5^2 - (\sqrt{40.5})^2$

   $JQ^2 = 272.25 - 40.5$

   $JQ^2 = 231.75$

This problem asks us to find the length of line segment EF in a parallelogram ABCD, given that the angle bisectors of angles ABC and BCD intersect AD at points E and F, respectively, and that AB = 3 and AD = 4.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**  An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. So, angle ABE is equal to angle CBE, and angle BCF is equal to angle DCF.

2. **Using Properties of Parallelograms:**  In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore, AB = CD = 3 and BC = AD = 4.

3. **Finding Angles:** Since AB = BC, triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle. Therefore, angle BAC = angle BCA.  Similarly, angle CDA = angle CAD.

4. **Applying Angle Sum Property:** The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.  In triangle ABE, we have:
   * angle ABE + angle BAE + angle AEB = 180 degrees
   * Since angle ABE = angle CBE, we can write: angle CBE + angle BAE + angle AEB = 180 degrees

5. **Using the Angle Bisector Property:**  Since BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, we have:
   * angle ABE = angle CBE = (1/2) * angle ABC

6. **Finding Angle AEB:**  We know that angle ABC + angle BCD = 180 degrees (because they are consecutive interior angles of parallel lines).  Therefore, angle ABC = 180 degrees - angle BCD.  Substituting this into the equation from step 5, we get:
   * angle ABE = angle CBE = (1/2) * (180 degrees - angle BCD)

7. **Finding Angle AEB (continued):**  Substituting the values of angle ABE and angle CBE into the equation from step 4, we get:
   * (1/2) * (180 degrees - angle BCD) + angle BAE + angle AEB = 180 degrees
   * Simplifying, we get: angle BAE + angle AEB = 90 degrees + (1/2) * angle BCD

8. **Finding Angle AEB (continued):**  Since angle BAE = angle CDA (from step 3), we can write:
   * angle CDA + angle AEB = 90 degrees + (1/2) * angle BCD

9. **Finding Angle AEB (continued):**  In triangle CDE, we have:
   * angle CDE + angle CED + angle DCE = 180 degrees
   * Since angle DCE = angle DCF (from step 1), we can write: angle CDE + angle CED + angle DCF = 180 degrees
   * Since angle DCF = (1/2) * angle BCD, we can write: angle CDE + angle CED + (1/2) * angle BCD = 180 degrees
   * Simplifying, we get: angle CDE + angle CED = 180 degrees - (1/2) * angle BCD

10. **Finding Angle AEB (continued):**  Since angle CDE = angle CDA (from step 3), we can write:
   * angle CDA + angle CED = 180 degrees - (1/2) * angle BCD

11. **Comparing Equations:**  Comparing the equations from step 8 and step 10, we see that:
   * angle AEB = angle CED

12. **Using Similar Triangles:**  Triangles AEB and CED are similar because they have two equal angles (angle AEB = angle CED and angle BAE = angle CDA).  Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal:
   * AE/CE = AB/CD = 3/3 = 1

13. **Finding EF:**  Since AE = CE, we can conclude that E is the midpoint of AD.  Therefore, EF = (1/2) * AD = (1/2) * 4 = 2.

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle EOB, given that angle BOC is 50 degrees and line OD bisects angle AOE.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Bisectors:**  A bisector divides an angle into two equal parts. Since OD bisects angle AOE, that means angle AOD is equal to angle DOE.

2. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  Angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.  So, angle AOD + angle DOE + angle EOB = 180 degrees.

3. **Finding Angle AOE:**  Since angle AOD = angle DOE, we can say that 2 * angle AOD = angle AOE.

4. **Using Vertical Angles:**  Vertical angles are opposite angles formed by two intersecting lines. They are always equal. So, angle BOC = angle AOE = 50 degrees.

5. **Solving for Angle EOB:**  We know angle AOE = 50 degrees and angle AOD + angle DOE + angle EOB = 180 degrees.  Since angle AOD = angle DOE, we can say 2 * angle AOD = 50 degrees.  Therefore, angle AOD = 25 degrees.  Now, we can plug in the values: 25 degrees + 25 degrees + angle EOB = 180 degrees.  Solving for angle EOB, we get angle EOB = 130 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Central Angles:**  A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle (point O in our diagram). The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it intercepts.

2. **Finding Arc Measures:** We know that the central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees, so the measure of arc AB is also 90 degrees. Similarly, the central angle of arc CD is 50 degrees, so the measure of arc CD is also 50 degrees.

3. **Using Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  An inscribed angle is an angle whose vertex lies on the circle and whose sides are chords of the circle. The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

4. **Applying the Theorem:**  Angle P is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AC.  To find the measure of arc AC, we can add the measures of arc AB and arc BC. Since arc BC is the same as arc CD, we have:

This problem asks us to find the length of one side of a square that fits perfectly inside a circle with a known area. 

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find the circle's radius:**  We know the area of the circle is 18π square units.  The formula for the area of a circle is  Area = πr², where 'r' is the radius.  Let's plug in what we know and solve for 'r':

   18π = πr²
   18 = r²
   r = √18 = 3√2 

2. **Connect the radius to the square:**  Imagine drawing a line from the center of the circle to one corner of the square. This line is a radius of the circle, and it also forms the diagonal of a smaller right triangle inside the square.  The legs of this triangle are half the length of a side of the square.

3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**  The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In our case, the hypotenuse is the radius (3√2), and the legs are half the side of the square (let's call that 's/2').  So, we can write:

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle CAB, given that AB is the diameter of a circle, CD is a chord of the circle, and angle ADC is 26 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Key Concept:**  We need to remember that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle.  Since AB is the diameter, the triangle ACB is inscribed in a semicircle.

2. **Applying the Concept:**  This means that angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees).

3. **Using the Angle Sum Property:**  The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  So, in triangle ADC, we have: ∠ADC + ∠DAC + ∠ACD = 180 degrees.

4. **Finding ∠ACD:**  We know ∠ADC = 26 degrees.  Since ∠ACD and ∠ACB are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees), we can find ∠ACD: ∠ACD = 180 degrees - ∠ACB = 180 degrees - 90 degrees = 90 degrees.

5. **Solving for ∠DAC:**  Now we can plug the values into the angle sum property equation: 26 degrees + ∠DAC + 90 degrees = 180 degrees.  Solving for ∠DAC, we get: ∠DAC = 180 degrees - 26 degrees - 90 degrees = 64 degrees.

6. **Finding ∠CAB:**  Finally, since ∠DAC and ∠CAB are supplementary angles, we can find ∠CAB: ∠CAB = 180 degrees - ∠DAC = 180 degrees - 64 degrees = 116 degrees.

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle C in quadrilateral ABCD, given that the circle with center O is circumscribed around the quadrilateral and angle O is 110 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**  We know that the circle is circumscribed around the quadrilateral, meaning all four vertices of the quadrilateral lie on the circle.  This tells us that the quadrilateral is cyclic.

2. **Key Property of Cyclic Quadrilaterals:**  A very important property of cyclic quadrilaterals is that the opposite angles add up to 180 degrees.  So, in our quadrilateral ABCD, we have: ∠A + ∠C = 180° and ∠B + ∠D = 180°.

3. **Finding Angle A:**  Notice that angle A is an inscribed angle of the circle, and its intercepted arc is the same arc that forms angle O.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, ∠A = 1/2 * ∠O = 1/2 * 110° = 55°.

4. **Calculating Angle C:**  Now that we know ∠A = 55°, we can use the property of cyclic quadrilaterals to find ∠C: ∠A + ∠C = 180°.  Substituting ∠A = 55°, we get 55° + ∠C = 180°.  Solving for ∠C, we get ∠C = 180° - 55° = 125°.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify Parallel Lines and Corresponding Angles:**  We know that AB is parallel to CD and BC is parallel to DE. This means that angle A and angle C are corresponding angles, and angle B and angle D are also corresponding angles.

2. **Find Angle B:** Since AB is parallel to CD, angle A and angle C are corresponding angles, and therefore equal. So, angle C = angle A = 45 degrees.

3. **Find Angle D:** Since BC is parallel to DE, angle B and angle D are corresponding angles, and therefore equal.  We know that the angles in a quadrilateral add up to 360 degrees. So, angle B + angle C + angle D + angle E = 360 degrees.  We know angle C is 110 degrees and angle A (which is equal to angle B) is 45 degrees.  So, 45 degrees + 110 degrees + angle D + angle E = 360 degrees.  Simplifying, we get angle D + angle E = 205 degrees.

4. **Find Angle AED:**  Angle AED is the same as angle E.  We know that angle D + angle E = 205 degrees.  Since angle D is equal to angle B, which is 45 degrees, we can substitute to find angle E: 45 degrees + angle E = 205 degrees.  Solving for angle E, we get angle E = 160 degrees.

This problem asks us to find the area of triangle ABC, given that point D divides side BC into segments BD and DC with lengths 2 and 1, respectively, and the area of triangle ACD is 12.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  We know that triangles ACD and ABD share the same height (the perpendicular distance from point A to line BC).  This means the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases.

2. **Setting up the Ratio:**  The base of triangle ACD is DC (length 1), and the base of triangle ABD is BD (length 2).  So, the ratio of their bases is 1:2.

3. **Applying the Ratio to Areas:** Since the ratio of the bases is 1:2, the ratio of their areas is also 1:2.  This means the area of triangle ABD is twice the area of triangle ACD.

4. **Calculating the Area of Triangle ABD:**  We know the area of triangle ACD is 12, and the area of triangle ABD is twice that, so the area of triangle ABD is 12 * 2 = 24.

1. **Identify the key information:** We know that triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at C. We also know the lengths of AB (13) and AC (5).  We are told that D and E are the midpoints of AC and AB, respectively.

2. **Apply the Midsegment Theorem:** The Midsegment Theorem states that the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.  

   * In our triangle, DE is the line segment connecting the midpoints of AC and AB.
   * Therefore, DE is parallel to BC and half the length of BC.

3. **Find the length of BC:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BC. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

   * In our triangle, BC is the hypotenuse, and AC and AB are the other two sides.

2. **Key Observations:**
   * **Midpoint:**  N is the midpoint of BC, meaning BN = NC.
   * **Angle Bisector:** AM bisects angle BAC, meaning angle BAM = angle MAC.
   * **Perpendicular:** BM is perpendicular to AM, creating a right angle at M.

3. **Using the Properties:**
   * **Similar Triangles:**  Since AM bisects angle BAC, we can see that triangles ABM and ACM are similar.  This is because they share angle A, and angle BAM = angle MAC.  Similar triangles have proportional sides.
   * **Right Triangle:** Triangle BMN is a right triangle, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BM.

4. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   * In triangle BMN, we know MN = 2 and BN = BC/2 (since N is the midpoint).  We need to find BM.
   * The Pythagorean theorem states:  a² + b² = c², where a and b are the legs of a right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse.
   * In our case, BM is one leg, MN is the other leg, and BN is the hypotenuse.  So, we have: BM² + 2² = (BC/2)².

5. **Finding BM:**
   * We don't know BC yet, but we can use the fact that AB = 8 and triangles ABM and ACM are similar.
   * Since the sides of similar triangles are proportional, we have: BM/AB = MN/AC.
   * Substituting the known values: BM/8 = 2/AC.
   * Solving for BM: BM = 16/AC.

6. **Solving for AC:**
   * Now we can substitute BM = 16/AC into the Pythagorean theorem equation: (16/AC)² + 2² = (BC/2)².
   * We still need to find BC.  Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know BC = 2 * BN.
   * We can use the fact that triangles ABM and ACM are similar again: AB/AC = BM/CM.
   * Substituting the known values: 8/AC = (16/AC)/CM.
   * Solving for CM: CM = 2.
   * Now we can find BC: BC = BN + NC = 2 * BN = 2 * (BM + MN) = 2 * (16/AC + 2).

7. **Putting it all Together:**
   * Substitute BC = 2 * (16/AC + 2) into the Pythagorean theorem equation: (16/AC)² + 2² = (2 * (16/AC + 2)/2)².
   * Simplify and solve for AC: AC = **10**.

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle ACB, which is an angle inside a circle, given that PA and PB are tangents to the circle and angle P is 50 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Tangents:**  Remember that a tangent line to a circle touches the circle at exactly one point.  The important thing here is that a tangent line is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  So, we know that angle OAB and angle OBA are both right angles (90 degrees).

2. **Angles in a Quadrilateral:**  Let's look at quadrilateral OAPB.  We know that the sum of all angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.  We already know that angle OAB and angle OBA are 90 degrees each, and angle P is given as 50 degrees.  So, we can find angle AOB: 
   * 360 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees.  Therefore, angle AOB is 130 degrees.

3. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle:**  Angle AOB is a central angle, which means its vertex is at the center of the circle.  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle, which means its vertex is on the circle.  The important relationship here is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.  Since angle AOB is 130 degrees, angle ACB is half of that:
   * 130 degrees / 2 = 65 degrees.

This problem asks us to find the lengths of the two diagonals of a rhombus, given that one diagonal is twice as long as the other and the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Formula:**  We know the area of a rhombus is calculated by: 
   * Area = (1/2) * (diagonal 1) * (diagonal 2)

2. **Setting up the Equation:** Let's call the shorter diagonal ""d"". Since the longer diagonal is twice as long, it's ""2d"".  We can plug these values into the area formula:

This problem shows a circle with center O and radius 2.  Points A, B, and C are on the circle, and angle C is 30 degrees.  We need to find the length of chord AB.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Draw a radius:**  Since points A and B are on the circle, we can draw radii from the center O to points A and B.  This creates an isosceles triangle OAB, where OA = OB = 2 (the radius).

2. **Find the central angle:**  Angle AOB is the central angle that intercepts arc AB.  Since angle C is 30 degrees, and angle C intercepts the same arc as angle AOB, we know that angle AOB is also 30 degrees.

3. **Use the Law of Cosines:**  We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of side AB (the chord).  The Law of Cosines states:  c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where c is the side opposite angle C, and a and b are the other two sides.

   * In our triangle OAB, we have:
      * c = AB (the side we want to find)
      * a = OA = 2
      * b = OB = 2
      * C = angle AOB = 30 degrees

   * Plugging these values into the Law of Cosines:

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle AC'B' in a triangle formed by rotating another triangle. 

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Rotation:**  Imagine you're holding a triangle and spinning it 90 degrees clockwise. That's what's happening here! Triangle ABC is rotated to become triangle AB'C'.  The important thing to remember is that the angles within the triangle stay the same, even though the triangle's position changes.

2. **Finding Key Angles:**  We know that ∠CC'B' = 32.0 degrees.  Since triangle ABC was rotated 90 degrees, we know that ∠BAC = ∠B'AC' = 90.0 degrees.

3. **Using Angle Properties:**  The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  So, in triangle AC'B', we can find ∠AC'B' by subtracting the other two angles from 180 degrees:

2. **Using Angle Relationships:** Since BE bisects angle FBD, we know that angle FBE is equal to angle EBD. Similarly, since CE bisects angle ACD, we know that angle ACE is equal to angle ECD.

3. **Finding Angle BEC:**  Angle BEC is formed by the intersection of BE and CE.  We can use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees to find the measure of angle BEC.  

    * Angle BEC + angle ACE + angle ECD = 180 degrees
    * Since angle ACE = angle ECD, we can rewrite this as: angle BEC + 2 * angle ACE = 180 degrees
    * We know angle BEC is 35 degrees, so: 35 degrees + 2 * angle ACE = 180 degrees
    * Solving for angle ACE: 2 * angle ACE = 145 degrees
    * Therefore, angle ACE = 72.5 degrees

4. **Finding Angle FAE:**  Now we can use the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find angle FAE.

    * Angle FAE + angle ACE + angle AEC = 180 degrees
    * We know angle ACE is 72.5 degrees and angle AEC is 35 degrees (given in the problem).

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle CAB, given that angle DCB is 40 degrees and points A, B, and C lie on a circle with center O.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Tangents:**  The line CD is tangent to the circle at point C. This means that line CD touches the circle at only one point, and it forms a right angle with the radius drawn to that point. So, angle OCB is a right angle (90 degrees).

This problem asks us to find the tangent of angle M in the right triangle shown, and then express that answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Tangent:**  Remember, the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the side adjacent to the angle.  In our triangle, the side opposite angle M is PN, which has a length of 15. The side adjacent to angle M is MN, which has a length of 36.

2. **Setting up the Ratio:**  So, the tangent of angle M (tan M) is equal to the opposite side (PN) divided by the adjacent side (MN): 
   * tan M = PN / MN 
   * tan M = 15 / 36

3. **Simplifying the Ratio:** We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3:

The problem asks us to find the area of a parallelogram given the lengths of two sides and the measure of one angle.

# Solution Breakdown

1. **Understanding Parallelograms:** A parallelogram is a four-sided shape where opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.  

2. **Area Formula:** The area of a parallelogram is calculated by multiplying the length of its base by its height.  We can write this as a formula: 
   * Area = base * height

3. **Finding the Height:**  We know the length of the base (BC = 9.0).  To find the height, we need to use the information about angle B.  Since angle B is 30 degrees, we can use trigonometry to find the height.  

4. **Trigonometry:**  The sine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse.  In our parallelogram, we can draw a perpendicular line from point A to line BC, creating a right triangle.  The height of the parallelogram is the opposite side of angle B, and AB is the hypotenuse.  So, we can write:
   * sin(30°) = height / AB

5. **Solving for Height:** We know sin(30°) = 1/2 and AB = 6.0.  Plugging these values into the equation, we get:
   * 1/2 = height / 6.0
   * height = 6.0 * (1/2) = 3.0

1. **Isosceles Triangle Property:**  An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length.  In this triangle, we know that AB = BC because the problem tells us it's isosceles.

2. **Setting up the Equation:** Since AB = BC, we can set the expressions for those sides equal to each other: 
   * 9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5

3. **Solving for x:** Now we need to solve for the value of x.  Let's do this step-by-step:
   * Subtract 5x from both sides: 9x - 1 - 5x = 5x - 0.5 - 5x
   * Simplify: 4x - 1 = -0.5

2. **Area of an Equilateral Triangle:** The area of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula:  Area = (√3 / 4) * side²

3. **Finding the Sides:**  We know the areas of two equilateral triangles, so we can use the area formula to find their sides:
    * For triangle A'BC: 10 = (√3 / 4) * side²  => side² = 40/√3 => side = √(40/√3)
    * For triangle AB'C: 4 = (√3 / 4) * side² => side² = 16/√3 => side = √(16/√3)

4. **Identifying the Sides of the Right Triangle:**  Notice that the sides of the equilateral triangles are also the sides of the right triangle ABC.  Therefore, we know the lengths of two sides of the right triangle:
    * BC = √(40/√3)

1. **Understanding the Diagram:**  We have a circle with a diameter AB, and two chords EF and EB.  Point E is the midpoint of chord FEB, meaning it divides the chord into two equal parts.  We also know that EF intersects AB at point C, and we're given that angle AOF is 40 degrees.

2. **Key Properties:**  Let's use some important properties of circles and angles:
   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

3. **Finding Angle EOF:**  Since angle AOF is 40 degrees, and AO and OF are radii of the circle, triangle AOF is an isosceles triangle.  Therefore, angle AFO is also 40 degrees.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, angle EOF is 180 - 40 - 40 = 100 degrees.

4. **Finding Angle EFB:**  Angle EOF is a central angle intercepting arc EF.  Therefore, arc EF measures 100 degrees.  Angle EFB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EF, so its measure is half of arc EF, which is 100/2 = 50 degrees.

5. **Finding Angle F:**  Since E is the midpoint of FEB, angle FEF is equal to angle BEF.  We know angle EFB is 50 degrees, and the angles in triangle EFB add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle F (angle EFB) is (180 - 50)/2 = 65 degrees.

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle EOD, given that the diameter CD of circle O bisects chord EF at point G, and angle DCF is 20 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**  We know that a diameter of a circle always bisects the circle, meaning it cuts it exactly in half.  We also know that a diameter passing through the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to that chord.  This means that angle CGF is a right angle (90 degrees).

2. **Finding Angle CFG:** Since angle CGF is a right angle and angle DCF is 20 degrees, we can find angle CFG by subtracting: 90 degrees - 20 degrees = 70 degrees.

3. **Using Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  Angle EOD is an inscribed angle, which means its vertex is on the circle and its sides are chords of the circle.  The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In this case, angle EOD intercepts arc EF.

4. **Finding Arc EF:**  Angle CFG is a central angle, which means its vertex is at the center of the circle.  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, arc EF is also 70 degrees.

5. **Calculating Angle EOD:**  Since angle EOD intercepts arc EF, which is 70 degrees, and the Inscribed Angle Theorem tells us the inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc, angle EOD is 70 degrees / 2 = 35 degrees.

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle C in the circle, given the measures of other angles within the circle.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  We know that angles formed by intersecting chords within a circle have a special relationship.  The measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

2. **Identifying the Intercepted Arcs:**  Let's look at angle C.  It's formed by chords BC and CD.  The intercepted arc for angle C is arc BD.  We need to find the measure of arc BD.

3. **Using the Given Information:** We know that angle D is 35 degrees.  Angle D is also formed by chords CD and AD, and its intercepted arc is arc AC.  Since the measure of an angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc, we can say that arc AC is 2 * 35 degrees = 70 degrees.

4. **Finding the Missing Arc:**  We also know that angle AEC is 105 degrees.  This angle is formed by chords AC and BC, and its intercepted arc is arc ABC.  Since the measure of an angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc, we can say that arc ABC is 2 * 105 degrees = 210 degrees.

5. **Calculating Arc BD:**  We know that the entire circle has 360 degrees.  So, arc BD is equal to 360 degrees - arc AC - arc ABC = 360 degrees - 70 degrees - 210 degrees = 80 degrees.

6. **Finding Angle C:**  Finally, we can find the measure of angle C.  Angle C is formed by chords BC and CD, and its intercepted arc is arc BD.  Therefore, angle C is half the measure of arc BD, which is 80 degrees / 2 = 40 degrees.

This problem shows a circle with a triangle inside it. We need to find the length of side *x* of the triangle. 

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the Key Relationship:**  Notice that the triangle has a side that's a diameter of the circle (the side with length 24).  This means we have a special kind of triangle called a ""right triangle"" because the angle opposite the diameter is always a right angle (90 degrees).

2. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**  The Pythagorean Theorem helps us find the missing side of a right triangle. It says:  *a² + b² = c²*, where *a* and *b* are the lengths of the two shorter sides (legs) of the right triangle, and *c* is the length of the longest side (hypotenuse).

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle BAO, given that angle ACB is 25 degrees and points A, B, and C lie on a circle with center O.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  The key here is that angle ACB is an inscribed angle, and angle BAO is a central angle.  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share an endpoint on the circle. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.

2. **The Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In our case, angle ACB intercepts arc AB.

2. **Angle Properties:**  Since AB is the diameter, angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

3. **Finding Angle C:** We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So, in triangle ABC:
   * ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
   * 25° + ∠B + 90° = 180°
   * ∠B = 180° - 25° - 90° = 65°

The problem shows a circle with a diameter of 8 and a chord that is 13.5 units long. We need to find the length of the segment that connects the center of the circle to the chord.

# Solution Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Diagram:**  We have a circle with a diameter of 8, which means the radius is 4. The chord CE is 13.5 units long. We need to find the length of BD, which is the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the chord.

2. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  We can see that triangle BDC is a right triangle. We know the hypotenuse BC is the radius of the circle (4 units). We also know that CD is half the length of the chord CE (13.5/2 = 6.75 units).

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle OAC in a circle where we know some angles and parallel lines.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify Key Information:** We know that AO is parallel to BC, and angle AOB is 40 degrees.  We also know that O is the center of the circle, which means OA and OB are radii of the circle.

2. **Parallel Lines and Alternate Interior Angles:** Since AO is parallel to BC, we know that angle AOB and angle OBC are alternate interior angles.  Alternate interior angles are equal, so angle OBC is also 40 degrees.

3. **Isosceles Triangle:**  OA and OB are radii of the same circle, so they are equal in length. This means triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle.  In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.  Therefore, angle OAB is also 40 degrees.

4. **Angles in a Triangle:** The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  So, in triangle AOB, we have:  angle AOB + angle OAB + angle ABO = 180 degrees.  We know angle AOB and angle OAB are both 40 degrees, so: 40 degrees + 40 degrees + angle ABO = 180 degrees.  Solving for angle ABO, we get: angle ABO = 100 degrees.

5. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  Angle ABO and angle OBC are angles on a straight line, so they add up to 180 degrees.  We know angle ABO is 100 degrees, so angle OBC is 80 degrees.

6. **Angles in a Triangle (Again):**  Now, let's look at triangle OAC.  We know angle OAC is what we're trying to find.  We also know angle OCA is 40 degrees (because it's equal to angle OBC).  Finally, we know angle AOC is 100 degrees (because it's equal to angle ABO).  Using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we have: angle OAC + angle OCA + angle AOC = 180 degrees.  Substituting the values we know, we get: angle OAC + 40 degrees + 100 degrees = 180 degrees.  Solving for angle OAC, we get: angle OAC = 40 degrees.

This problem shows a rhombus (a special type of parallelogram with all sides equal) and asks us to find the length of line segment EF, given that E and F are the midpoints of sides AB and AD, respectively. We also know that AB = 5 and AC = 6.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Properties of a Rhombus:**  A rhombus has many special properties.  One important one is that its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This means that line segment AC cuts line segment BD in half at point O, and they form a 90-degree angle.

2. **Finding the Length of BO:** Since AC is a diagonal of the rhombus, it cuts the rhombus into two congruent triangles.  Therefore, AO = OC = AC/2 = 6/2 = 3.  We also know that AB = 5, and since E is the midpoint of AB, AE = EB = AB/2 = 5/2 = 2.5.  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BO:  BO² = AB² - AO² = 5² - 3² = 16.  Therefore, BO = √16 = 4.

3. **Finding the Length of EF:**  Since O is the midpoint of BD, we know that BO = OD = 4.  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find EF:  EF² = EO² + OF² = (BO + OE)² + (DO - OF)² = (4 + 2.5)² + (4 - 2.5)² = 42.25 + 2.25 = 44.5.  Therefore, EF = √44.5.

This problem asks us to find the perimeter of a triangle, given two of its sides, and then determine which of the given options cannot be the perimeter.

# Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Perimeter:** The perimeter of any shape is the total length of all its sides added together.  So, for a triangle, the perimeter is side 1 + side 2 + side 3.

2. **Finding the Possible Range:**  To figure out which option is impossible, we need to find the range of possible perimeters.  Here's how:
   * **Smallest Perimeter:** The smallest perimeter happens when the third side is as small as possible.  The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  So, the third side must be greater than 12 - 7 = 5.  The smallest possible perimeter is 7 + 12 + 5 = 24.

2. **Angles in a Triangle:** The sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, in triangle ABC, we have: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.

3. **Finding Angles B and C:** We know ∠A = 110°.  Let's say ∠B = 2x and ∠C = 2y (since OB and OC are angle bisectors).  Substituting these values into the equation from step 2: 110° + 2x + 2y = 180°.

4. **Simplifying the Equation:**  Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 2y = 70°.

5. **Angles in Triangle BOC:**  Now, let's look at triangle BOC.  We know:

4. **Finding the Angles:**  Since A' is the reflection of A, ∠AMB = ∠A'MB. Similarly, ∠A'ND = ∠AN'D.  Since A'' is the reflection of A', ∠A'MN = ∠A''MN.

5. **Calculating the Sum:**  We know that ∠BAD = 120 degrees.  Since ∠AMB = ∠A'MB and ∠A'ND = ∠AN'D, we can say that ∠A''MN + ∠AN'D = 120 degrees.  Therefore, ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 120 degrees.

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle E in triangle DEF, given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Congruent Triangles:** Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, we know that their corresponding angles are equal. This means angle A is equal to angle D, angle B is equal to angle E, and angle C is equal to angle F.

2. **Angle Bisector:** CD bisects angle BCA, meaning it divides angle BCA into two equal angles.  Let's call each of these smaller angles x. So, angle BCD = angle ACD = x.

3. **Angle Relationships:** We know that the angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's look at triangle ABC:
    * Angle A + angle B + angle C = 180 degrees
    * 22 degrees + angle B + 2x = 180 degrees (Since angle C is divided into two x's)
    * Angle B = 158 degrees - 2x

4. **Finding Angle F:** Now let's look at triangle CGF:
    * Angle CGF + angle FCG + angle F = 180 degrees
    * 88 degrees + x + angle F = 180 degrees (Since angle FCG is one of the x's)
    * Angle F = 92 degrees - x

5. **Angle E:** Since angle F is equal to angle C, we know angle C = 92 degrees - x.  We also know that angle B is equal to angle E.  So, angle E = 158 degrees - 2x.

6. **Solving for x:** We can now use the fact that angle C is equal to angle F to solve for x:
    * 92 degrees - x = 92 degrees - x
    * This equation tells us that x can be any value.

7. **Finding Angle E:** Since x can be any value, we can substitute it back into the equation for angle E:
    * Angle E = 158 degrees - 2x
    * Angle E = 158 degrees - 2(any value)

## The Answer:

This problem shows a circle with a diameter AB and points C and D on the circle.  We're given that angle BCD is 25 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle AOD.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  Since AB is a diameter, angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle.

2. **Finding Angle CBD:**  We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  So, in triangle BCD, we have: ∠CBD = 180° - ∠BCD - ∠CDB = 180° - 25° - 90° = 65°.

3. **Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle CBD intercepts arc AD, so ∠CBD = 1/2 * arc AD.  Therefore, arc AD = 2 * ∠CBD = 2 * 65° = 130°.

4. **Finding Angle AOD:**  Angle AOD is a central angle that intercepts the same arc AD.  A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, ∠AOD = arc AD = 130°.

## The Answer:

The measure of angle AOD is **130 degrees**.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle PAQ in a triangle ABC, given that A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP and A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ.

# Solution Breakdown

1. **Understanding Symmetry:**  Symmetry means that if you fold the figure along the line of symmetry, the two halves will perfectly match.  So, since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, the distance from A to MP is the same as the distance from B to MP.  The same applies to A and C with respect to line NQ.

2. **Finding Key Angles:**  Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to MP, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP.  Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to NQ, we know that ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.

3. **Using Angle Properties:**  We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, in triangle AMP, we have: ∠AMP + ∠MAP + ∠PMA = 180 degrees.  Similarly, in triangle ANQ, we have: ∠ANQ + ∠NAQ + ∠NQA = 180 degrees.

4. **Solving for ∠PAQ:**  We can now use the information we have to find ∠PAQ.  Since ∠AMP = ∠BMP and ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ, we can rewrite the equations from step 3 as:

   * 2 * ∠AMP + ∠MAP + ∠PMA = 180 degrees
   * 2 * ∠ANQ + ∠NAQ + ∠NQA = 180 degrees

   We also know that ∠BAC = 110 degrees.  Therefore, ∠MAP + ∠NAQ = 110 degrees.

   Now, we can add the two equations above and substitute ∠MAP + ∠NAQ = 110 degrees:

   2 * ∠AMP + 2 * ∠ANQ + 110 degrees + ∠PMA + ∠NQA = 360 degrees

   Simplifying, we get:

   ∠AMP + ∠ANQ + ∠PMA + ∠NQA = 125 degrees

   Finally, we can see that ∠PAQ = ∠PMA + ∠NQA.  Therefore, ∠PAQ = 125 degrees.

The problem asks us to find the value of *x* in the given circle, where we know that two chords are congruent and one of the angles formed by the chords is expressed in terms of *x*.

# Solution Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We're dealing with a circle and its chords.  We know that congruent chords create equal central angles.  This means the central angle formed by chord CH is equal to the central angle formed by chord KJ.

2. **Setting up the Equation:**  We're given that the measure of angle KJL is (2x - 27) degrees. Since CH and KJ are congruent, the measure of angle CLH is also (2x - 27) degrees.

3. **Using the Angle Addition Postulate:**  The measure of angle CLH is equal to the sum of the measures of angles CLJ and JLH.  We know that angle CLJ is 83 degrees.  So, we can write the equation: (2x - 27) = 83 + JLH.

4. **Solving for JLH:**  We can see that angle JLH is a vertical angle to angle GJH.  Vertical angles are congruent, so the measure of angle JLH is also 83 degrees.

5. **Solving for x:** Now we can substitute 83 degrees for JLH in our equation: (2x - 27) = 83 + 83.  Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x - 27 = 166.  Adding 27 to both sides, we get: 2x = 193.  Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 96.5.

This problem asks us to find the length of side RS of an equilateral triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides in terms of 'x'.

# Solution Breakdown:

1. **Equilateral Triangle Property:**  An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal in length.  So, we know that side QR is equal to side RS, and side QS is also equal to side RS.

2. **Setting up the Equation:** We are given that QR = 4x and QS = 6x - 1. Since all sides are equal in an equilateral triangle, we can set these two expressions equal to each other: 
   4x = 6x - 1

3. **Solving for x:** Now we need to solve for 'x'.  Let's subtract 4x from both sides of the equation:
   4x - 4x = 6x - 1 - 4x
   This simplifies to:
   0 = 2x - 1

4. **Isolating x:**  Add 1 to both sides of the equation:
   0 + 1 = 2x - 1 + 1
   This gives us:
   1 = 2x

5. **Final Step:** Divide both sides by 2 to get the value of x:
   1 / 2 = 2x / 2
   This simplifies to:
   x = 1/2

6. **Finding RS:** Now that we know x = 1/2, we can substitute it back into the expression for RS (which is the same as QS):
   RS = 6x - 1
   RS = 6(1/2) - 1
   RS = 3 - 1

The problem asks us to find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of an isosceles right triangle.

# Solution Breakdown

1. **Understanding Center of Mass:** The center of mass is the point where the entire mass of an object can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object like our triangle, the center of mass lies on the line of symmetry.

2. **Dividing the Triangle:** Imagine dividing the triangle into a bunch of tiny, equal-sized pieces.  Each piece has its own center of mass.  The center of mass of the whole triangle is the average of the positions of all these tiny centers of mass.

3. **Finding the y-coordinate:** Since the triangle is symmetrical, the center of mass will lie on the y-axis.  We need to find the average y-coordinate of all the tiny pieces.  Think of it like this: the y-coordinate of the center of mass is the same as the y-coordinate of the point where the triangle would balance perfectly on a horizontal line.

This problem asks us to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b' in an infinitely long chain of resistors, where each resistor has a value of 1 ohm.

# Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Circuit:**  Imagine the circuit as a series of repeating units. Each unit consists of three resistors connected in parallel, and these units are connected in series.

2. **Simplifying the Circuit:** Let's focus on one unit. The three resistors in parallel have a combined resistance of R/3 (since the reciprocal of the total resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of individual resistances in parallel).

3. **The Recursive Pattern:** Now, we have a series combination of this R/3 resistance and the rest of the infinite chain.  The key is that the rest of the chain is identical to the original circuit! This means the total resistance (let's call it 'R_total') can be expressed as:

   R_total = R/3 + R_total

4. **Solving for R_total:** This is a simple equation to solve.  Subtract R_total from both sides:

   (2/3) * R_total = R/3

   Multiply both sides by (3/2):

   R_total = (R/3) * (3/2) = R/2

This problem asks us to find the perimeter of rectangle ABCD, which is divided into two identical squares. We know the area of each square is 9.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find the side length of the square:**  We know the area of a square is side * side (s * s). Since the area is 9, we need to find the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 9. That number is 3 (3 * 3 = 9). So, each side of the square is 3 units long.

2. **Determine the dimensions of the rectangle:** The rectangle is made up of two squares side-by-side.  This means the width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square (3 units). The length of the rectangle is equal to two side lengths of the squares (3 units + 3 units = 6 units).

3. **Calculate the perimeter:** The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up the lengths of all its sides.  The formula is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).  Let's plug in our values: Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 3) = 2 * 9 = 18.

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle D, given that AB is the diameter of circle O, DB and DC are tangents to the circle, and angle ACE is 25 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Tangents:**  Remember that a tangent line to a circle touches the circle at exactly one point.  The important thing to know is that a tangent line is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  So, we know that angle OBC and angle OCD are both right angles (90 degrees).

2. **Angles in a Triangle:**  Let's look at triangle OBC. We know that angle OBC and angle OCD are both 90 degrees.  The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  So, angle BOC must be 180 - 90 - 90 = 0 degrees.  This means that points B, O, and C are all on the same line!

We know that angle ACE is 25 degrees, so angle BCD must be 180 - 25 = 155 degrees.  Finally, since angle BCD and angle D are supplementary angles, angle D must be 180 - 155 = 25 degrees.

757,Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.,7.2,"## Problem Summary:

This problem shows a circle with two secant lines intersecting outside the circle. We need to find the length of the segment marked 'x'.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Theorem:** This problem uses the **Secant-Secant Theorem**, which states that when two secants intersect outside a circle, the product of the lengths of one secant segment and its external segment equals the product of the lengths of the other secant segment and its external segment. 

2. **Applying the Theorem:** Let's break down the segments:
   * **Secant 1:** The longer secant line has a total length of 15 + 12 = 27. Its external segment is 12.
   * **Secant 2:** The shorter secant line has a total length of x + 8. Its external segment is 8.

3. **Setting up the Equation:**  According to the Secant-Secant Theorem, we can write the equation: 
   * 27 * 12 = (x + 8) * 8

4. **Solving for x:**
   * 324 = 8x + 64
   * 260 = 8x
   * x = 32.5

364,"As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of ⊙O, and points C and D are on ⊙O. If ∠ABD = 50.0, then the degree of ∠BCD is ()",40°,"## Problem Summary:

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle BCD, given that AB is the diameter of circle O, and angle ABD is 50 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Key Concept:**  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

2. **Finding Angle CBD:**  We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  In triangle ABD, we have:

   ∠ABD + ∠BAD + ∠ADB = 180°

   Since AB is a diameter, ∠ADB is also a right angle (90 degrees).  So, we can solve for ∠BAD:

   50° + ∠BAD + 90° = 180°
   ∠BAD = 40°

   Now, we can find ∠CBD:

   ∠CBD = ∠ABD - ∠BAD = 50° - 40° = 10°

3. **Finding Angle BCD:**  Finally, we can find ∠BCD using the fact that the angles in triangle BCD add up to 180 degrees:

   ∠BCD + ∠CBD + ∠BDC = 180°

   Since ∠BDC is a right angle (90 degrees), we have:

   ∠BCD + 10° + 90° = 180°
   ∠BCD = 80°

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle BFC in a triangle where we know the measure of angle ACG and that CD and BE are angle bisectors.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**  The lines CD and BE are angle bisectors, which means they divide the angles they intersect into two equal parts.  So, ∠ACD = ∠BCD and ∠ABE = ∠CBE.

2. **Finding ∠ACD:** Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know ∠AGC = 90°.  We also know ∠ACG = 32°.  The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so ∠CAD = 180° - 90° - 32° = 58°.  Since CD is an angle bisector, ∠ACD = ∠CAD / 2 = 58° / 2 = 29°.

3. **Finding ∠BCF:**  We know ∠ACD = 29° and ∠ACG = 32°.  The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so ∠CBF = 180° - 29° - 32° = 119°.

4. **Finding ∠BFC:**  We know ∠BCF = 119° and ∠CBF = 119°.  The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so ∠BFC = 180° - 119° - 119° = -58°.  However, angles cannot be negative.  This means we made a mistake somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.

5. **Correcting the Mistake:**  We made a mistake in step 4.  We should have used ∠CBF = 119° and ∠BCF = 119° to find ∠BFC.  The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so ∠BFC = 180° - 119° - 119° = **-58°.**  However, angles cannot be negative.  This means we made a mistake somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.

6. **Finding ∠BFC:**  We know ∠BCF = 119° and ∠CBF = 119°.  The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so ∠BFC = 180° - 119° - 119° = **-58°.**  However, angles cannot be negative.  This means we made a mistake somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.

7. **Finding ∠BFC:**  We know ∠BCF = 119° and ∠CBF = 119°.  The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so ∠BFC = 180° - 119° - 119° = **-58°.**  However, angles cannot be negative.  This means we made a mistake somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.

8. **Finding ∠BFC:**  We know ∠BCF = 119° and ∠CBF = 119°.  The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so ∠BFC = 180° - 119° - 119° = **-58°.**  However, angles cannot be negative.  This means we made a mistake somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.

955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"## Problem Summary:

This problem asks us to find the measure of angle ADE in a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Regular Polygons:** A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal.  Since ABCDE is a regular pentagon, all its angles are equal.

2. **Central Angle:** The central angle of a regular polygon is the angle formed by connecting the center of the polygon to two consecutive vertices.  In this case, angle AOB is a central angle of the pentagon.

3. **Central Angle Formula:** The measure of each central angle of a regular polygon is found by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides.  So, for a pentagon, each central angle measures 360 degrees / 5 sides = 72 degrees.  Therefore, angle AOB = 72 degrees.

4. **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share the same endpoint on the circle.  Angle ADE is an inscribed angle.  The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

5. **Intercepted Arc:** The intercepted arc of angle ADE is arc AE.  Since arc AE is a side of the regular pentagon, it's 1/5 of the entire circle.  Therefore, arc AE measures (1/5) * 360 degrees = 72 degrees.

6. **Finding Angle ADE:**  Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem, angle ADE = (1/2) * arc AE = (1/2) * 72 degrees = 36 degrees.

This problem shows us two line segments meeting at a point on a line. We are given that one angle is 70 degrees, and we need to find the value of y, which is equal to the square of the other angle, x.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  We know that the angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees. So, we can write an equation: x + 70 = 180.

2. **Solving for x:** To find x, we need to isolate it. We can do this by subtracting 70 from both sides of the equation: x = 180 - 70.

3. **Calculating x:**  180 - 70 = 110. So, x = 110 degrees.

4. **Finding y:** The problem tells us that y is equal to the square of x.  This means y = x².
