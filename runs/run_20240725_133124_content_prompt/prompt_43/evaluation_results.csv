643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"**1. <PROBLEM>The Case:**</PROBLEM>**
   * We are given a circle with a diameter CD and a chord DE that is parallel to the radius OA. We know that angle D measures 50 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle C.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
      * Since CD is the diameter of the circle, we know that angle COD is a straight angle, meaning it measures 180 degrees.
      * Because DE is parallel to OA, we can use the property of alternate interior angles. This means that angle D and angle A are equal. 
   * **Step 2: Calculate angle A.**
      * We know that angle D is 50 degrees, and since angle D and angle A are alternate interior angles, angle A is also 50 degrees.
   * **Step 3: Calculate angle COA.**
      * We know that angle COD is 180 degrees, and we just found that angle A (which is the same as angle COA) is 50 degrees.  Therefore, angle COA is 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees.
   * **Step 4: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In our case, angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CA.  Angle COA is the central angle that intercepts the same arc CA.
      * Therefore, angle C is half the measure of angle COA.
   * **Step 5: Calculate angle C.**
      * We know that angle COA is 130 degrees.  Therefore, angle C is 130 degrees / 2 = 65 degrees.

**3. <ANSWER>The Solution:**</ANSWER>**
   * The degree of angle C is 65 degrees.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"**1. <PROBLEM>The Case:**</PROBLEM>**
* We have a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees and one side measuring 4 units. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is labeled as 'h'.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
* **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio.**
   * We know the length of the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle (4 units) and we want to find the length of the hypotenuse. 
   * The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is the cosine: 
      * **cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse**
* **Step 2: Substitute the known values.**
   * We know the angle is 60 degrees and the adjacent side is 4 units. Let's plug these values into the cosine formula:
      * **cos(60°) = 4 / h**
* **Step 3: Solve for 'h'.**
   * We need to isolate 'h' on one side of the equation. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 'h':
      * **h * cos(60°) = 4**
   * Now, divide both sides of the equation by cos(60°) to get 'h' by itself:
      * **h = 4 / cos(60°)**
* **Step 4: Calculate the value of cos(60°) and solve for 'h'.**
   * The cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2. Let's substitute this value into the equation:
      * **h = 4 / (1/2)**
   * Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 1/2 is 2/1. So, we have:
      * **h = 4 * (2/1)**
      * **h = 8**

**3. <ANSWER>The Solution:**</ANSWER>**
* The length of the hypotenuse, 'h', is 8 units.

   * **Step 1: Identify the relationship between the inscribed angle and the central angle.**
      * In this problem, angle ABC is an inscribed angle, and angle AOC is a central angle. Both angles intercept the same arc AC.
      * The relationship between an inscribed angle and a central angle intercepting the same arc is that the measure of the central angle is twice the measure of the inscribed angle.

   * We are given a diagram with two intersecting lines, AB and CD, forming four angles. One of the angles, ∠AOD, is 70 degrees. A ray OE bisects another angle, ∠BOC. Our goal is to find the measure of angle ∠AOE.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Identify the relationship between ∠AOD and ∠BOC.**
      *  ∠AOD and ∠BOC are **vertical angles**. Vertical angles are formed by two intersecting lines and are always equal in measure.
      *  Therefore, ∠BOC = ∠AOD = 70°.

   * **Step 2: Understand the concept of angle bisector.**
      * A ray that bisects an angle divides it into two equal angles.
      * Since OE bisects ∠BOC, we know that ∠BOE = ∠COE = (1/2)∠BOC.

   * **Step 3: Calculate the measure of ∠BOE.**
      * We know ∠BOC = 70°.
      * Therefore, ∠BOE = (1/2) * 70° = 35°.

   * **Step 4: Identify the relationship between ∠AOE and ∠BOE.**
      * ∠AOE and ∠BOE are **adjacent angles** that form a **linear pair**. This means they share a common side (OE) and their measures add up to 180°.

   * We need to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force acting on particle 3. This means we need to figure out how much force each of the other particles exerts on particle 3 in the horizontal direction, and then add those forces together.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**
      * Particle 1 exerts a force on particle 3, let's call it F13.
      * Particle 2 exerts a force on particle 3, let's call it F23.
      * Particle 4 exerts a force on particle 3, let's call it F43.
   * **Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of each force using Coulomb's Law.**
      * Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, it's written as:
         *  F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
         * Where:
            * F is the force between the charges
            * k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
            * q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges
            * r is the distance between the charges
      * Let's calculate the magnitude of each force:
         * F13 = k * |q1 * q3| / (2a)^2 
         * F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / a^2
         * F43 = k * |q4 * q3| / a^2
   * **Step 3: Determine the direction of each force.**
      * F13 is attractive because q1 and q3 have opposite signs, and it acts along the diagonal of the square.
      * F23 is repulsive because q2 and q3 have the same sign, and it acts horizontally to the right.
      * F43 is repulsive because q4 and q3 have the same sign, and it acts vertically downwards.
   * **Step 4: Find the x-component of each force.**
      * F13 has both x and y components. We need to find the x-component, which is F13 * cos(45°) because the angle between F13 and the x-axis is 45 degrees.
      * F23 acts entirely in the x-direction, so its x-component is simply F23.
      * F43 acts entirely in the y-direction, so its x-component is 0.
   * **Step 5: Add the x-components of all the forces to find the net x-component of the force on particle 3.**
      * Net force in x-direction = F13 * cos(45°) + F23 + 0

**3. <ANSWER>The Solution:**</ANSWER>**
   * Now, let's plug in the values and calculate the net force:
      * F13 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * |(100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C)| / (2 * 0.05 m)^2 = 0.17975 N
      * F23 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * |(100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C)| / (0.05 m)^2 = 0.719 N
      * Net force in x-direction = (0.17975 N) * cos(45°) + (0.719 N) + 0 = 0.868 N

* **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio.** We know the opposite side and the hypotenuse, so we'll use the sine function (sin). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.

   * **Step 1: Identify the Similar Triangles**
      *  We can see that triangle ABC is similar to triangle ABD and triangle ADC. This is because they share the same angles: ∠A is common to all three triangles, and ∠ADB = ∠ADC = 90°.
   * **Step 2: Use the Proportionality of Sides in Similar Triangles**
      * Since triangles ABC and ABD are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal. This means: AB/AD = AC/BC.
      * Similarly, since triangles ABC and ADC are similar, we have: AC/AD = BC/DC.
   * **Step 3: Express the Sides in Terms of Grid Units**
      * By counting the grid units, we can determine the lengths of the sides:

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Understanding Tangent Properties**
      *  We know that tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. This means that PA = PB = 8.0.
      *  We also know that the radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent. Therefore, OA is perpendicular to PA, and OB is perpendicular to PB.

   * **Step 2: Identifying Key Shapes**
      *  We can see that triangles OAC and OBC are right-angled triangles.

   * **Step 3: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**
      *  In right-angled triangle OAC, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of OC:
         *  OC² = OA² + AC²
      *  Similarly, in right-angled triangle OBC, we can find the length of OB:
         *  OB² = OB² + BC²

   * **Step 4: Recognizing Congruent Triangles**
      *  Since OA = OB (radii of the same circle), AC = BC (tangents from the same point), and ∠OAC = ∠OBC = 90°, we can conclude that triangles OAC and OBC are congruent by the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) congruence rule.

   * **Step 5: Finding the Perimeter of Triangle PCD**
      *  The perimeter of triangle PCD is PC + CD + PD.
      *  Since PC = PA - AC and PD = PB - BD, and AC = BC and CD is the common tangent, we can write the perimeter as:
         *  Perimeter = (PA - AC) + CD + (PB - BD)
         *  Perimeter = PA + PB + CD - (AC + BD)
         *  Perimeter = 8.0 + 8.0 + CD - (AC + BD)
         *  Perimeter = 16.0 + CD - (AC + BD)

   * **Step 6: Simplifying the Expression**
      *  Since AC = BC and BD = CD, we can simplify the expression:
         *  Perimeter = 16.0 + CD - (AC + BD)
         *  Perimeter = 16.0 + CD - (AC + CD)
         *  Perimeter = 16.0 - AC

   * **Step 7: Finding the Value of AC**
      *  We know that AC = BC, and we can find the value of BC using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OBC.
      *  Let's assume the radius of the circle is 'r'. Then, OB = r and BC = √(OB² - OC²).
      *  Since triangles OAC and OBC are congruent, OC = AC.
      *  Therefore, AC = √(OB² - OC²) = √(r² - AC²).
      *  Solving for AC, we get AC = r/√2.

   * **Step 8: Calculating the Perimeter**
      *  Substituting the value of AC in the perimeter expression:
         *  Perimeter = 16.0 - AC
         *  Perimeter = 16.0 - (r/√2)

**3. <ANSWER>The Solution:**</ANSWER>**
   * The perimeter of triangle PCD is 16.0 - (r/√2), where 'r' is the radius of the circle. Since we don't have the value of the radius, we cannot find the exact numerical value of the perimeter. However, we have successfully expressed the perimeter in terms of the radius.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Understanding Medians and Area**
      * A median divides a triangle into two triangles with equal areas. This is because the median creates two triangles with the same base (the side it bisects) and the same height (the perpendicular distance from the opposite vertex to the base).
      * In our case, AD is the median of triangle ABC, so triangles ABD and ACD have equal areas.

      * The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  
      * This means that the incenter is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle.
   * **Step 2: Draw the Inradius**
      * Draw a line segment from the incenter $Q$ to side $JL$, making sure it is perpendicular to $JL$. This line segment is called the inradius.
   * **Step 3: Recognize Right Triangles**
      * We now have two right triangles: $\triangle JQP$ and $\triangle LQP$.
   * **Step 4: Apply the Incenter Property**
      * Since $Q$ is the incenter, the inradius $QP$ is equal to the distance from $Q$ to both $JL$ and $LN$.

   * **Step 7: Use the Pythagorean Theorem Again**
      * In right triangle $\triangle LQM$, we know the length of one leg $QM = 9$ and we need to find the length of the hypotenuse $LN$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem again: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

      * We need to find the length of $LM$ to solve for $LN$.
   * **Step 8: Find the Length of LM**
      * Since $Q$ is the incenter, the inradius $QP$ is equal to the distance from $Q$ to both $JL$ and $LN$. Therefore, $LM = QP$.
   * **Step 9: Calculate the Semiperimeter**
      * Now that we know the lengths of all three sides of the triangle, we can calculate the semiperimeter: $s = (JL + LN + JN)/2$.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**

      * A perpendicular bisector is a line that cuts a line segment into two equal parts and is perpendicular to that line segment. 
      * In our case, since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

      * The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. 
      * Applying this to triangle ABE, we have: AB + BE > AE. 
      * Since AB = 6 and BE = BC - CE, we can substitute these values: 6 + (BC - CE) > AE.

   * **Step 4: Combine the Information**
      * We know that AC + CE + AE = 13 and 6 + (BC - CE) > AE. 
      * Adding these two inequalities, we get: AC + CE + AE + 6 + (BC - CE) > AE + 13.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Understanding Angle Bisectors**
      *  A bisector divides an angle into two equal parts. Since OD bisects angle AOE, this means that angle AOD is equal to angle DOE. 
   * **Step 2: Identifying Vertical Angles**
      * Vertical angles are opposite angles formed by two intersecting lines. They are always equal. In our diagram, angle BOC and angle AOD are vertical angles. Therefore, angle AOD = angle BOC = 50 degrees.
   * **Step 3: Finding Angle AOE**
      * Since OD bisects angle AOE, and angle AOD = 50 degrees, then angle DOE also equals 50 degrees. 
      * Angle AOE is the sum of angles AOD and DOE. So, angle AOE = 50 degrees + 50 degrees = 100 degrees.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Identify the key relationship.**  Notice that DE connects the midpoints of two sides of the triangle. This means DE is a midsegment of triangle ABC.

   * **Step 2: Apply the Midsegment Theorem.** The Midsegment Theorem states that the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length. 

   * **Step 3: Apply the theorem to our triangle.** Since DE is a midsegment, it's parallel to BC and half the length of BC.

In our case, a = AC = 5 and c = AB = 13. So, 5² + b² = 13².  Solving for b, we get b² = 13² - 5² = 144. Therefore, BC = √144 = 12.

      * It's always helpful to visualize the problem. Draw a triangle ABC with point N on BC, AM bisecting angle BAC, and BM perpendicular to AM. Label the points A, B, C, M, and N.
   * **Step 2: Identify key relationships.**
      * Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know that BN = NC.
      * Since AM bisects angle BAC, we know that angle BAM = angle CAM.
      * Since BM is perpendicular to AM, we know that angle BMA = angle CMA = 90 degrees.
   * **Step 3: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem.**
      * The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides. In our case, this means that AB/AC = BM/CM.
   * **Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem.**
      * We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the lengths of BM and CM. In right triangle BMA, we have BM² + AM² = AB². Similarly, in right triangle CMA, we have CM² + AM² = AC².
   * **Step 5: Solve for AC.**
      * We know AB = 8 and MN = 2. Since BM is perpendicular to AM, we can see that MN is the height of triangle BMA. Therefore, BM = √(AB² - MN²) = √(8² - 2²) = √60.
      * Using the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have AB/AC = BM/CM. Substituting the values we know, we get 8/AC = √60/CM.
      * Solving for CM, we get CM = (√60 * AC)/8.
      * Now, using the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle CMA, we have CM² + AM² = AC². Substituting the value of CM, we get ((√60 * AC)/8)² + AM² = AC².
      * Simplifying the equation, we get 15/16 * AC² - AC² + AM² = 0.
      * Rearranging the terms, we get AM² = 1/16 * AC².
      * Since AM is a common side to both triangles BMA and CMA, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle BMA to find AM: AM² = AB² - BM² = 8² - (√60)² = 4.
      * Substituting the value of AM² in the equation AM² = 1/16 * AC², we get 4 = 1/16 * AC².

      * Since CE bisects angle ACD, angle BCE = y.
      * Since BE bisects angle FBD, angle CBE = x.
      * So, we have: 35 degrees = y + x.

   * **Step 4: Finding Angle FAE**
      * Angle FAE is the sum of angles FAB and BAE.
      * Angle FAB is the same as angle FBD (they are vertically opposite angles). So, angle FAB = 2x.
      * Angle BAE is the same as angle BCE (they are vertically opposite angles). So, angle BAE = y.
      * Therefore, angle FAE = angle FAB + angle BAE = 2x + y.

   * **Step 5: Solving for Angle FAE**
      * We know that 35 degrees = y + x.
      * We want to find 2x + y.
      * To do this, we can multiply the equation 35 degrees = y + x by 2: 70 degrees = 2y + 2x.
      * Now we have 2x + y = 70 degrees.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
      *  Since CD is tangent to the circle at point C, we know that line segment OC is perpendicular to line segment CD. This is because a tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.
      *  We also know that angle ACB is an inscribed angle of the circle, and its intercepted arc is arc AB.

   * **Step 2: Apply the Tangent-Chord Theorem.**
      * The Tangent-Chord Theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord drawn to the point of tangency is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.
      * In our case, angle DCB intercepts arc BC. Therefore, we can write:

         *  40° = 1/2 * measure of arc BC
         *  measure of arc BC = 80°

   * **Step 3: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

   * **Step 1: Understanding the Relationship between Areas and Side Lengths**
      *  We know that the area of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula: Area = (√3/4) * side²

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
      * Since AB is the diameter of the circle, angle AEB is a right angle (90 degrees) because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle.
      * Since E is the midpoint of FEB, we know that angle FEA is equal to angle EBA.
   * **Step 2: Apply the Angle Addition Postulate.**
      * Angle AOF is equal to the sum of angles AOE and EOF.
      * We know that angle AOF is 40 degrees, so we can write: 40° = angle AOE + angle EOF.
   * **Step 3: Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
      * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * Angle AOE intercepts arc AE, and angle EOF intercepts arc EF.
      * Therefore, angle AOE = 1/2 * arc AE and angle EOF = 1/2 * arc EF.
   * **Step 4: Substitute and solve for angle EOF.**
      * We know that angle AOE + angle EOF = 40°.
      * Substituting the values from Step 3, we get: (1/2 * arc AE) + (1/2 * arc EF) = 40°.
      * Simplifying, we get: 1/2 * (arc AE + arc EF) = 40°.
      * Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: arc AE + arc EF = 80°.
      * Since arc AE + arc EF = arc AEF, we have: arc AEF = 80°.
      * Therefore, angle EOF = 1/2 * arc EF = 1/2 * 80° = 40°.
   * **Step 5: Find angle F.**
      * We know that angle FEA = angle EBA (from Step 1).
      * We also know that angle AEB = 90° (from Step 1).

   * We are given a circle with a diameter CD that intersects the midpoint G of chord EF. We know that angle DCF is 20 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle EOD.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Identify Key Relationships**
      * Since CD is a diameter, it passes through the center of the circle, O. This means that angle COD is a straight angle, measuring 180 degrees.
      * Because G is the midpoint of chord EF, we know that OG is perpendicular to EF. This means that angle OGE and angle OGF are both right angles (90 degrees).

   * **Step 2: Apply Angle Properties**
      * We know that angle DCF is 20 degrees. Since angle COD is a straight angle, we can find angle DOC by subtracting angle DCF from 180 degrees:
         * angle DOC = 180 degrees - 20 degrees = 160 degrees
      * Now, let's focus on triangle DOC. The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore:
         * angle DOC + angle OCD + angle ODC = 180 degrees
         * Since angle DOC is 160 degrees and angle OCD is half of angle DCF (because G is the midpoint of EF), we can find angle ODC:
            * angle ODC = 180 degrees - 160 degrees - 10 degrees = 10 degrees

   * **Step 3: Utilize the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
      * The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In our case, angle EOD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc ED.
      * Since angle ODC is 10 degrees, and angle ODC is half of the central angle COD, we can find the measure of arc ED:
         * arc ED = 2 * angle ODC = 2 * 10 degrees = 20 degrees

   * **Step 4: Calculate the Final Angle**
      * Now that we know the measure of arc ED, we can use the inscribed angle theorem again to find angle EOD:
         * angle EOD = 1/2 * arc ED = 1/2 * 20 degrees = 10 degrees

   * **Step 3:  Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find AE.**  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In this case, AD is the hypotenuse, AE is one leg, and DE is the other leg.  So, we have:

      * Since OC is an angle bisector, ∠BCO = 1/2 * ∠ACB.
      * Therefore, 1/2 * ∠ABC + 1/2 * ∠ACB + ∠BOC = 180°.
   * **Step 4: Using the Angle Sum Property of Triangle ABC**
      * The sum of the interior angles of triangle ABC is 180 degrees: ∠ABC + ∠BAC + ∠ACB = 180°.
      * We know ∠BAC = 110°.
      * Therefore, ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 70°.
   * **Step 5: Substituting and Solving for ∠BOC**
      * Substituting the value of ∠ABC + ∠ACB from Step 4 into the equation from Step 3, we get: 1/2 * 70° + ∠BOC = 180°.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles 1 and B.**
      *  Angle 1 and angle B are **alternate interior angles**. This means they are on opposite sides of the transversal (the line that intersects the parallel lines) and inside the parallel lines.
      * **Important Rule:** Alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines are always equal.

   * We have two parallel lines intersected by a transversal. We need to find the value of 'y' in the expression for the angle marked as '-y'.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Identify the angle relationship.**
      * The angles marked as '2x + 6' and '-y' are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal intersects two parallel lines. They occupy the same relative position at each intersection.
   * **Step 2: Apply the corresponding angles theorem.**

      * We can substitute this expression for 'y' into the second equation: 2x + 6 = 3/5(-2x - 6) + 2
      * Simplify the equation: 2x + 6 = -6/5x - 18/5 + 2
      * Combine like terms: 2x + 6 = -6/5x - 8/5

      *  ∠ACB = 180° - ∠ACD - ∠BCD = 180° - ∠BCA/2 - ∠BCA/2 = 180° - ∠BCA
   * **Step 2: Find angle BCA.** Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, we know that corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle BCA is equal to angle FDE. We also know that angle CGF is 88 degrees. Since angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle FDE:
      * ∠FDE = 180° - ∠CGF = 180° - 88° = 92°

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
      * Since AB is the diameter of the circle, we know that angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.
   * **Step 2: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**
      * In triangle BCD, we have: ∠BCD + ∠CBD + ∠CDB = 180° (The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees).
      * We know ∠BCD = 25°.  Let's call ∠CBD = x and ∠CDB = y.  So, we have: 25° + x + y = 180°.
      * Solving for x + y, we get: x + y = 155°.
   * **Step 3: Utilize the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.**
      * Angle AOD is a central angle, and angle ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc AD.  The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
      * Therefore, ∠AOD = 2 * ∠ACB = 2 * 90° = 180°.
   * **Step 4: Apply the angle sum property again.**
      * In triangle AOD, we have: ∠AOD + ∠ADO + ∠DAO = 180°.
      * We know ∠AOD = 180°.  We also know that ∠ADO = ∠CDB = y (they are vertical angles).  Let's call ∠DAO = z.  So, we have: 180° + y + z = 180°.
      * Solving for y + z, we get: y + z = 0°.
   * **Step 5: Combine the results.**
      * We found that x + y = 155° and y + z = 0°.  Adding these equations together, we get: x + y + y + z = 155° + 0°.
      * Simplifying, we get: x + 2y + z = 155°.
      * Since x + y = 155°, we can substitute to get: 155° + y + z = 155°.
      * This means y + z = 0°.  Since angles cannot be negative, this implies that both y and z are 0°.
   * **Step 6: Determine the final answer.**

   * **Step 2:  Center of Mass Intuition**
      * The center of mass is like the ""average"" position of all these tiny pieces. Since the triangle is symmetrical, we know the center of mass must lie on the line of symmetry, which is the vertical line going through the top vertex of the triangle.
   * **Step 3:  Divide the Triangle**
      * Let's divide the triangle into two equal halves by drawing a horizontal line through the midpoint of the base. Now we have two smaller triangles, each with the same area and density.
   * **Step 4:  Center of Mass of Each Half**
      * The center of mass of each smaller triangle is located at a distance of 1/3 of its height from its base. This is a general rule for triangles: the center of mass is always 1/3 of the way up from the base.
   * **Step 5:  Finding the Overall Center of Mass**
      * Since the two halves of the triangle are identical, their centers of mass are at the same distance from the base of the original triangle. This distance is 1/3 of the height of the smaller triangle, which is half the height of the original triangle.

   * We need to find the total resistance between points 'a' and 'b' in this infinite chain of resistors. Imagine you're trying to send electricity from point 'a' to point 'b' - how much resistance would it encounter along the way?

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1:  Simplify the Circuit**
      *  Notice that the circuit repeats itself. We can focus on one repeating unit, which consists of three resistors in parallel (connected side-by-side) and one resistor in series (connected end-to-end) with the parallel group. 
      *  Let's call the resistance of the parallel group 'Rp' and the resistance of the series resistor 'Rs'.

   * **Step 2: Calculate the Resistance of the Parallel Group (Rp)**
      *  The formula for calculating the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel is: 1/Rp = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3...
      *  In our case, we have three resistors with resistance 'R' in parallel. So, 1/Rp = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
      *  Therefore, Rp = R/3

   * **Step 3:  Calculate the Total Resistance of the Repeating Unit (Rt)**
      *  The total resistance of the repeating unit is the sum of the parallel group resistance (Rp) and the series resistor resistance (Rs).
      *  Rt = Rp + Rs = R/3 + R = 4R/3

   * **Step 4:  The Infinite Chain Trick**
      *  Here's the clever part!  Imagine removing the first repeating unit from the chain. The remaining circuit is still an infinite chain, just shifted over.  
      *  This means the resistance of the entire infinite chain (R∞) is equal to the resistance of one repeating unit (Rt) plus the resistance of the remaining infinite chain (R∞).
      *  We can write this as an equation: R∞ = Rt + R∞

   * **Step 5:  Solve for the Total Resistance (R∞)**
      *  Subtract R∞ from both sides of the equation: 0 = Rt

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Find the side length of each square.**
      * We know that the area of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself (side * side). 
      * Since the area of each square is 9, we need to find the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 9.

   * **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
      * Since AB is the diameter of the circle, we know that angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.
   * **Step 2: Apply the Angle Addition Postulate.**
      * We can see that angle ABD is made up of two smaller angles: angle ABC and angle CBD.  The Angle Addition Postulate states that the measure of a larger angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its smaller angles. So, we can write: ∠ABD = ∠ABC + ∠CBD.
   * **Step 3: Substitute known values.**
      * We know that ∠ABD = 50 degrees.  We also know that ∠ABC is a right angle, so ∠ABC = 90 degrees.  Substituting these values into the equation from Step 2, we get: 50° = 90° + ∠CBD.
   * **Step 4: Solve for ∠CBD.**
      * To isolate ∠CBD, we subtract 90 degrees from both sides of the equation: 50° - 90° = ∠CBD. This gives us ∠CBD = -40°. However, angles cannot be negative. This means we need to adjust our thinking.
   * **Step 5: Consider the full circle.**
      * Since ∠CBD is part of a circle, it must be less than 360 degrees.  We can find the actual measure of ∠CBD by adding 360 degrees to the negative value: -40° + 360° = 320°.
   * **Step 6: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle BCD intercepts the same arc as angle CBD. Therefore, ∠BCD = (1/2) * ∠CBD.
   * **Step 7: Calculate ∠BCD.**

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1:  Understanding Angle Bisectors**
      * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.  This means that angle ACF is equal to angle BCF, and angle ABF is equal to angle CBF.
   * **Step 2:  Using the Perpendicular Line**
      * Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know that angle CGB is a right angle (90 degrees).
   * **Step 3:  Finding Angle FCG**
      * We know that angle ACG is 32 degrees.  Since angle CGB is 90 degrees, we can find angle FCG by subtracting:
         * Angle FCG = Angle CGB - Angle ACG = 90 degrees - 32 degrees = 58 degrees.
   * **Step 4:  Finding Angle BFC**
      * We know that angle BFC is the sum of angles FCG and GCB.  Since CF is the angle bisector of angle ACB, we know that angle GCB is half of angle ACB.  Therefore:
         * Angle BFC = Angle FCG + Angle GCB = 58 degrees + (1/2) * Angle ACB.
   * **Step 5:  Finding Angle ACB**
      * We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore:
         * Angle ACB = 180 degrees - Angle CAB - Angle CBA.
      * Since BF is the angle bisector of angle ABC, we know that angle CBA is twice the size of angle CBF.  Similarly, since CF is the angle bisector of angle ACB, we know that angle ACB is twice the size of angle ACF.  Therefore:
         * Angle ACB = 2 * Angle ACF = 2 * (Angle ACB / 2) = Angle ACB.
      * This means that angle ACB is equal to itself, which is always true.
   * **Step 6:  Putting it All Together**

955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"**1. <PROBLEM>The Case:**</PROBLEM>**
   * We are given a regular pentagon (ABCDE) inscribed in a circle with center O. We need to find the measure of angle ADE.

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1: Understanding the Properties of a Regular Pentagon**
      * A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles.
      * The sum of the interior angles of any pentagon is 540 degrees.
      * Therefore, each interior angle of a regular pentagon measures 540/5 = 108 degrees.

   * **Step 2: Finding the Measure of Angle AED**
      * Since ABCDE is a regular pentagon, angle AED measures 108 degrees.

   * **Step 3: Finding the Measure of Angle AOD**
      * Angle AOD is a central angle of the circle, and it intercepts arc AD.
      * The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * Since arc AD is 1/5 of the circumference of the circle, angle AOD measures (1/5) * 360 degrees = 72 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Finding the Measure of Angle ADE**
      * Triangle AOD is an isosceles triangle because OA = OD (radii of the circle).
      * Therefore, angles OAD and ODA are equal.
      * The sum of the angles in triangle AOD is 180 degrees.
      * So, angle OAD + angle ODA + angle AOD = 180 degrees.
      * Substituting the known values, we get: angle OAD + angle ODA + 72 degrees = 180 degrees.
      * Simplifying, we get: angle OAD + angle ODA = 108 degrees.
      * Since angle OAD = angle ODA, each of these angles measures 108/2 = 54 degrees.
      * Finally, angle ADE = angle AED - angle ODA = 108 degrees - 54 degrees = 54 degrees.

**3. <ANSWER>The Solution:**</ANSWER>**
   * The measure of angle ADE is 54 degrees.

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"**1. <PROBLEM>The Case:**</PROBLEM>**
   * We need to find the value of 'y' in the given figure. We know that 'y' is equal to the square of 'x', and we also know that 'x' and 70 degrees form a straight angle. 

**2. <SOLUTION>Cracking the Code:**</SOLUTION>**
   * **Step 1:**  We know that a straight angle measures 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 70 = 180.
      * This is because the angles 'x' and 70 degrees together make up a straight angle.
   * **Step 2:**  To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. We can do this by subtracting 70 from both sides of the equation: x + 70 - 70 = 180 - 70.
      * This is because subtracting the same value from both sides of an equation keeps the equation balanced.
   * **Step 3:**  Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 110.
      * This is the result of performing the subtraction on both sides of the equation.
   * **Step 4:**  We know that y = x². So, we can substitute the value of 'x' we just found: y = 110².
      * This is because we are given that 'y' is equal to the square of 'x'.
   * **Step 5:**  Calculating 110², we get: y = 12100.
      * This is the result of squaring the value of 'x'.

**3. <ANSWER>The Solution:**</ANSWER>**
   * The value of y is 12100.
