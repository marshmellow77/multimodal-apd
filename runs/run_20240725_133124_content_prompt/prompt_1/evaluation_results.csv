643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand the Properties**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Parallel Lines:** When parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.

**2. Apply the Properties**

* **Angle D:** Since CD is the diameter, ∠D intercepts a semicircle, which has a measure of 180°.  Therefore, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, ∠D = 1/2 * 180° = 90°.
* **Angle AOD:**  Since ∠D = 90°, and ∠D and ∠AOD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°), we have ∠AOD = 180° - 90° = 90°.
* **Angle EOA:**  Because DE || OA, ∠EOA and ∠D are corresponding angles, so ∠EOA = ∠D = 90°.
* **Angle AOC:**  Since ∠AOD = 90° and ∠EOA = 90°, then ∠AOC = ∠AOD + ∠EOA = 90° + 90° = 180°.
* **Angle C:**  ∠C is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AC, which is the same arc intercepted by central angle AOC.  Therefore, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, ∠C = 1/2 * ∠AOC = 1/2 * 180° = 90°.

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Central Angle Theorem:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

**Solving the Problem**

1. **Identify the Intercepted Arc:**  ∠ABC intercepts arc AC.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** Since ∠ABC is an inscribed angle, its measure is half the measure of arc AC:
   ∠ABC = (1/2) * arc AC

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Angles on a straight line:**  Angles AOD and DOB form a straight angle, which measures 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle DOB = 180 degrees - 70 degrees = 110 degrees.

2. **Vertical angles:** Angles DOB and AOC are vertical angles, meaning they are equal.  Therefore, angle AOC = 110 degrees.

3. **Angle bisector:** OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides angle BOC into two equal angles.  Therefore, angle BOE = angle COE = (1/2) * angle BOC.

4. **Angles at a point:** Angles BOE, COE, and AOC form a complete angle, which measures 360 degrees.  Therefore, angle BOE + angle COE + angle AOC = 360 degrees.

5. **Substitution:** Substituting the values we know, we get: (1/2) * angle BOC + (1/2) * angle BOC + 110 degrees = 360 degrees.

294,"In Fig. 21-25, the particles have charges $q_1=-q_2=100 \mathrm{nC}$ and $q_3=-q_4=200 \mathrm{nC}$, and distance $a=$ $5.0 \mathrm{~cm}$. What is the $x$ component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3?",0.17,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Identify the forces acting on particle 3**

Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to particles 1, 2, and 4. Let's denote these forces as F13, F23, and F43, respectively.

**2. Determine the direction of each force**

* **F13:**  Particles 1 and 3 have opposite charges, so the force between them is attractive. This force acts along the diagonal of the square, pointing towards particle 1.
* **F23:** Particles 2 and 3 have the same charge, so the force between them is repulsive. This force acts horizontally to the right.
* **F43:** Particles 3 and 4 have the same charge, so the force between them is repulsive. This force acts vertically upwards.

**3. Calculate the magnitude of each force**

We can use Coulomb's Law to calculate the magnitude of each force:

* **F13:**  
   *  F13 = k * |q1 * q3| / r13² 
   *  where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²), q1 and q3 are the charges, and r13 is the distance between particles 1 and 3 (which is the diagonal of the square).
   *  r13 = √(a² + a²) = a√2
   *  F13 = (8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²) * (100 x 10^-9 C) * (200 x 10^-9 C) / (5 x 10^-2 m * √2)² 
   *  F13 ≈ 0.36 N

* **F23:**
   *  F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / r23²
   *  where r23 is the distance between particles 2 and 3 (which is the side of the square).
   *  F23 = (8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²) * (100 x 10^-9 C) * (200 x 10^-9 C) / (5 x 10^-2 m)²
   *  F23 ≈ 0.72 N

* **F43:**
   *  F43 = k * |q4 * q3| / r43²
   *  where r43 is the distance between particles 4 and 3 (which is the side of the square).
   *  F43 = (8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²) * (200 x 10^-9 C) * (200 x 10^-9 C) / (5 x 10^-2 m)²
   *  F43 ≈ 1.44 N

**4. Resolve each force into its x-component**

* **F13:** The x-component of F13 is F13 * cos(45°) ≈ 0.36 N * 0.707 ≈ 0.25 N (since the angle between F13 and the x-axis is 45 degrees).
* **F23:** The x-component of F23 is F23 itself, since it acts horizontally. So, F23x = 0.72 N.
* **F43:** The x-component of F43 is 0 N, since it acts vertically.

**5. Calculate the net x-component of the force**

The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of all the forces:

*  Fnet,x = F13x + F23x + F43x 
*  Fnet,x = 0.25 N + 0.72 N + 0 N
*  Fnet,x = 0.97 N

**Therefore, the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is approximately 0.97 N.**

1. **Identify the key shapes:** We have a right triangle ABC, with AD as the altitude drawn from the right angle vertex A to the hypotenuse BC.

2. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**  We can find the lengths of AB and AC using the Pythagorean Theorem, as they are the hypotenuses of right triangles formed by the grid lines.

   * AB:  AB is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 3 and 4.  Therefore, AB = √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5.

   * AC: AC is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 1 and 4. Therefore, AC = √(1² + 4²) = √17.

3. **Apply the Geometric Mean Theorem:** The Geometric Mean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse is the geometric mean of the two segments it divides the hypotenuse into. In our case:

   * AD² = BD * CD

4. **Find BD and CD:**  To find BD and CD, we can use the fact that triangles ABD and ACD are similar (they share angle A and both have a right angle). This means their corresponding sides are proportional:

   * BD/AB = AD/AC 
   * CD/AC = AD/AB

   Solving for BD and CD, we get:

   * BD = (AB * AD) / AC
   * CD = (AC * AD) / AB

5. **Substitute into the Geometric Mean Theorem:** Substitute the expressions for BD and CD into the equation AD² = BD * CD:

   * AD² = [(AB * AD) / AC] * [(AC * AD) / AB]

6. **Simplify and solve for AD:**  The AB and AC terms cancel out, leaving:

   * AD² = AD² 
   * AD = √(AD²) = AD

   Since we know AD is a positive length, we can conclude that AD = **√(BD * CD)**.

7. **Calculate AD:**  We still need to find BD and CD.  We can use the fact that BC = BD + CD and the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle ABC:

   * BC² = AB² + AC² = 5² + (√17)² = 32
   * BC = √32 = 4√2

   Now, we can use the proportions we found earlier to solve for BD and CD:

   * BD = (AB * AD) / AC = (5 * AD) / √17
   * CD = (AC * AD) / AB = (√17 * AD) / 5

   Substituting these into BC = BD + CD:

   * 4√2 = (5 * AD) / √17 + (√17 * AD) / 5

   Solving for AD:

   * AD = (20√2) / (5 + √17)

   Rationalizing the denominator:

   * AD = (20√2 * (5 - √17)) / (25 - 17) = (100√2 - 20√34) / 8 = **(25√2 - 5√34) / 2**

Therefore, the length of AD is **(25√2 - 5√34) / 2**.

**Understanding the Geometry**

* **Tangents and Radii:**  When a line is tangent to a circle, it forms a right angle with the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OAC and ∠OBD are right angles.
* **Congruent Tangents:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are congruent. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.
* **Equal Lengths:**  Since CD is tangent to the circle, OC = OD (radii of the same circle).

**Solving the Problem**

1. **Focus on Triangles:**  We need to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.  Let's break it down into smaller triangles:
   *  Triangle OAC:  Right triangle with OA as a radius and AC as a tangent.
   *  Triangle OBD:  Right triangle with OB as a radius and BD as a tangent.

2. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Since we have right triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of AC and BD:
   *  In triangle OAC:  AC² = PA² - OA² 
   *  In triangle OBD:  BD² = PB² - OB²

3. **Equal Radii:**  OA and OB are both radii of the circle, so OA = OB.  Let's call this common length 'r'.

4. **Substituting and Simplifying:**
   *  AC² = 8² - r²
   *  BD² = 8² - r²
   *  Since AC² = BD², we know AC = BD.

5. **Perimeter of Triangle PCD:**
   *  Perimeter of △PCD = PC + CD + PD
   *  Perimeter of △PCD = (PA - AC) + CD + (PB - BD)
   *  Perimeter of △PCD = (8 - AC) + CD + (8 - BD)
   *  Perimeter of △PCD = 16 - AC + CD - BD
   *  Since AC = BD, the perimeter simplifies to: Perimeter of △PCD = 16 + CD

6. **Finding CD:**  We need to find the length of CD.  Notice that CD is the sum of the two tangents drawn from point C to the circle.  Since tangents from the same external point are congruent, CD = 2 * (length of one tangent).

7. **Final Calculation:**  We don't have enough information to find the exact length of CD (and therefore the perimeter of △PCD).  The perimeter will vary depending on the position of point C on line segment PA.

**Conclusion**

The perimeter of triangle PCD is **16 + CD**, where CD is the length of the tangent segment from point C to the circle.  We cannot determine a specific numerical answer without more information about the position of point C.

Since CD bisects angle ACB, we have:

∠ACD = ∠BCD = ∠ACB / 2

We also know that ∠DBC = 54°.  Since BD is perpendicular to CD, we have a right angle at D:

∠BDC = 90°

Therefore, in triangle BCD, we can find angle ACB:

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:** Since BE bisects ∠ABC, we know that ∠ABE = ∠CBE. Similarly, since CF bisects ∠BCD, we know that ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

2. **Parallel Lines and Alternate Interior Angles:**  In a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel. Therefore, AB || CD and AD || BC. This means:
    * ∠ABE = ∠CDE (alternate interior angles)
    * ∠CBE = ∠CDF (alternate interior angles)

3. **Combining Information:**  From steps 1 and 2, we can conclude:
    * ∠ABE = ∠CBE = ∠CDE = ∠CDF

4. **Similar Triangles:**  Triangles ABE and CDE share the same angles, making them similar triangles. Similarly, triangles BCF and DCF are also similar.

5. **Proportions:**  Since triangles ABE and CDE are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional:
    * AE/DE = AB/CD 
    * Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD = 3. Therefore, AE/DE = 3/3 = 1. This means AE = DE.

6. **Finding EF:**  Similarly, since triangles BCF and DCF are similar, we have:
    * BF/DF = BC/CD = 4/3 (since AD = 4 and AB = CD = 3)

7. **Using the Whole:**  We know that AD = AE + EF + FD = 4. Since AE = DE and BF/DF = 4/3, we can substitute:
    * DE + EF + (3/4)DE = 4
    * (7/4)DE + EF = 4
    * EF = 4 - (7/4)DE

8. **Solving for DE:**  Since AE = DE and AD = 4, we have:
    * DE + DE = 4
    * 2DE = 4
    * DE = 2

9. **Final Calculation:**  Substitute DE = 2 into the equation for EF:

* **Diameter as an Inscribed Angle:**  An inscribed angle that intercepts a diameter is a right angle (90 degrees).

**2. Apply the Properties**

* **Angle ADC:** Since ∠ADC intercepts arc AC, we know that the measure of arc AC is twice the measure of ∠ADC, or 2 * 26° = 52°.

* **Angle CAB:**  Since AB is a diameter, ∠CAB is a right angle (90°).

**3. Calculate ∠CAB**

We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°.  Therefore:

∠CAB + ∠ACB + ∠ABC = 180°
90° + 180° + ∠ABC = 180°
∠ABC = 180° - 90° - 180° = -90°

Since angles cannot be negative, we need to adjust our thinking.  The problem is that we've assumed ∠ABC is inside the triangle.  However, since ∠ACB is 180°, ∠ABC must be an exterior angle to the triangle.  

**4. Find the Exterior Angle**

The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.  Therefore:

∠ABC = ∠CAB + ∠ACD

**1. Understand the Theorem**

This problem involves the **Intersecting Secant-Secant Theorem**. This theorem states that when two secants intersect outside a circle, the product of the external segment of one secant and its whole length is equal to the product of the external segment of the other secant and its whole length.

**2. Apply the Theorem**

* **Secant 1:** The secant with length 24 has an external segment of length 'x' and a whole length of 'x + 24'.
* **Secant 2:** The secant with length 12.25 has an external segment of length 'y' and a whole length of 'y + 12.25'.

According to the theorem:
x(x + 24) = y(y + 12.25)

**3. Solve for x**

We need to find 'x', but we have two unknowns ('x' and 'y').  To solve this, we need to find another relationship between 'x' and 'y'.

Notice that the triangle formed by the secants and the diameter of the circle is a right triangle (since the diameter is a straight line and the angle formed by the secants is inscribed in a semicircle). We can use the Pythagorean theorem:

x² + 9² = (y + 12.25)²

**4. Simplify and Solve the System of Equations**

Now we have two equations:

1. x(x + 24) = y(y + 12.25)
2. x² + 81 = (y + 12.25)²

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Here's how to use substitution:

* **Solve equation 2 for y:**
   y = √(x² + 81) - 12.25
* **Substitute this value of y into equation 1:**
   x(x + 24) = (√(x² + 81) - 12.25)(√(x² + 81) - 12.25 + 12.25)
* **Simplify and solve for x:**
   x² + 24x = x² + 81
   24x = 81
   x = 81/24

We are given a triangle ABC with two internal angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. We know that angle A is 110 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle BOC.

**Step 2: Use the angle bisector theorem**

The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.

**Step 3: Apply the theorem to our problem**

Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, we can apply the angle bisector theorem to triangles ABO and ACO. This gives us:

* BO/AO = BC/AC
* CO/AO = BC/AB

**Step 4: Combine the equations**

Multiplying the two equations above, we get:

(BO/AO) * (CO/AO) = (BC/AC) * (BC/AB)

Simplifying, we get:

BO * CO / AO^2 = BC^2 / (AC * AB)

**Step 5: Use the angle sum property of triangles**

The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Applying this to triangle ABC, we get:

∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°

Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, we have:

∠ABO = ∠CBO = ∠B/2
∠ACO = ∠BCO = ∠C/2

Substituting these values into the angle sum property equation, we get:

110° + ∠B/2 + ∠C/2 = 180°

Simplifying, we get:

∠B + ∠C = 140°

**Step 6: Use the angle sum property of triangles again**

Applying the angle sum property to triangle BOC, we get:

∠BOC + ∠BCO + ∠CBO = 180°

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get:

∠BOC + ∠C/2 + ∠B/2 = 180°

Simplifying, we get:

∠BOC + (∠B + ∠C)/2 = 180°

**Step 7: Solve for ∠BOC**

Substituting the value of ∠B + ∠C = 140° into the equation above, we get:

2. **Using Angle Properties:** Since ∠A = 22°, and △ABC≌△DEF, we know that ∠D = 22° as well.

* **Symmetry with respect to a line:**  When two points are symmetrical with respect to a line, the line acts as a perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the two points. This means the line cuts the segment in half and forms a right angle.

**2. Applying Symmetry**

* **Point A and B:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, line MP is the perpendicular bisector of segment AB. This means ∠AMP = ∠BMP = 90°.
* **Point A and C:** Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, line NQ is the perpendicular bisector of segment AC. This means ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ = 90°.

1. **Identify the key angles:** We are given that ∠1 = 76° and the triangle contains a 30° angle. We need to find ∠2.

2. **Recognize parallel lines:** The lines l1 and l2 are parallel, which means that the angles formed by the transversal line (the line that intersects the parallel lines) are related.

726,Find x. Assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent.,10,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand the Geometry**

* **Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem:** The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

**2. Apply the Theorems**

* **Angle 1:** The angle formed by the tangent and chord (30°) intercepts the same arc as the inscribed angle (3x°).  Therefore, by the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem:
   * 30° = (1/2) * (3x°)
   * 60° = 3x°

* **Angle 2:** The inscribed angle (3x°) intercepts the same arc as the angle formed by the tangent and chord (4x + 50°). Therefore, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
   * 3x° = (1/2) * (4x + 50°)
   * 6x° = 4x + 50°

**3. Solve for x**

* **Equation 1:** 60° = 3x°
   * x = 20°

* **Equation 2:** 6x° = 4x + 50°

The error lies in assuming that the angle formed by the tangent and chord is 30°.  The diagram only shows a 30° angle, but it's not clear if that's the angle formed by the tangent and chord.

512,What is the y coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle of uniform areal density shown in Figure 9-C?,0.24,"Here's how to find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle:

**1. Understand the Concept of Center of Mass**

The center of mass of an object is the point where its entire mass can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object like an isosceles right triangle, the center of mass lies along the line of symmetry.

**2. Divide the Triangle into Smaller Parts**

Imagine dividing the triangle into an infinite number of infinitesimally thin horizontal strips. Each strip has a small mass, and its center of mass lies at its midpoint.

**3. Calculate the y-coordinate of the Center of Mass of Each Strip**

Let's consider a strip at a distance 'y' from the base of the triangle. Its width is 'dx' and its length is '2x'. Since the triangle is isosceles, the ratio of the length of the strip to its distance from the base is constant:

x/y = a/h (where 'h' is the height of the triangle)

Solving for 'x', we get:

x = (a/h) * y

**4. Calculate the Mass of Each Strip**

The mass of each strip is proportional to its area:

dm = σ * (2x) * dy (where σ is the areal density)

Substituting the value of 'x' from step 3:

dm = σ * (2a/h) * y * dy

**5. Integrate to Find the Total Mass**

To find the total mass (M) of the triangle, integrate the mass of each strip over the entire height of the triangle:

M = ∫dm = ∫(σ * (2a/h) * y * dy) from y = 0 to y = h

M = (σ * a/h) * ∫(2y * dy) from y = 0 to y = h

M = (σ * a/h) * [y^2] from y = 0 to y = h

M = (σ * a/h) * h^2

M = σ * a * h

**6. Calculate the y-coordinate of the Center of Mass**

The y-coordinate of the center of mass (y_cm) is given by:

y_cm = (1/M) * ∫(y * dm) from y = 0 to y = h

Substituting the values of 'dm' and 'M':

y_cm = (1/(σ * a * h)) * ∫(y * σ * (2a/h) * y * dy) from y = 0 to y = h

y_cm = (2/h^2) * ∫(y^2 * dy) from y = 0 to y = h

y_cm = (2/h^2) * [y^3/3] from y = 0 to y = h

y_cm = (2/h^2) * (h^3/3)

**y_cm = (2/3) * h**

**Therefore, the y-coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle is (2/3) * h, where 'h' is the height of the triangle.**

* **Combine resistors in parallel:** The top and bottom resistors (R and R) are in parallel. Their equivalent resistance is R/2.

* **Combine resistors in series:** The equivalent resistance of the parallel combination (R/2) is in series with the side resistor (R). The total resistance of this unit is R/2 + R = 3R/2.

* **The repeating pattern:**  The entire circuit is an infinite repetition of this unit (3R/2).

* **Equivalent resistance:**  Imagine removing one unit from the chain. The remaining circuit still has infinite resistance.  Since we removed a unit with resistance 3R/2, the original infinite chain must also have a resistance of 3R/2.

955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"The answer is 108 degrees. Here's how to solve it:

1. **Understanding the Properties of a Regular Pentagon:** A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of any pentagon is 540 degrees. Therefore, each interior angle of a regular pentagon measures 540/5 = 108 degrees.

2. **Central Angle:**  Angle AOB is a central angle of the pentagon, and it intercepts arc AB. Since the pentagon is regular, arc AB is 1/5 of the entire circumference of the circle. Therefore, the measure of central angle AOB is 1/5 of 360 degrees, which is 72 degrees.

3. **Inscribed Angle:** Angle ADE is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc AB as central angle AOB. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, angle ADE measures 1/2 * 72 degrees = 36 degrees.

4. **Finding Angle ADE:**  Since angle ADE is an interior angle of the pentagon, its measure is 108 degrees.

Therefore, the answer is **108 degrees**.

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Identify the relationship between the angles:** The angles x, y, and 70 degrees form a straight angle, which means they add up to 180 degrees.

2. **Set up an equation:**  x + y + 70 = 180

3. **Simplify the equation:** x + y = 110

4. **Use the given information:** We know that y = x².  Substitute this into the equation: x + x² = 110

5. **Solve for x:** This is a quadratic equation. Rearrange it to get: x² + x - 110 = 0.  Factor the equation: (x + 11)(x - 10) = 0.  This gives us two possible solutions: x = -11 or x = 10.  Since angles cannot be negative, we discard x = -11.

6. **Find y:**  We know y = x², and we found x = 10. Therefore, y = 10² = 100.

**Answer:** The value of y is 100.
