643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## The Mystery:

Imagine a circle with a line going straight across it, like a pizza cut in half. This line is called the diameter. Now, imagine another line inside the circle that doesn't go through the center, but is parallel to the diameter. We want to find the size of an angle formed by these two lines. We know one of the angles is 50 degrees, and we need to figure out the other one.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Basics:**  We know that a circle has 360 degrees.  A diameter divides the circle into two equal halves, each with 180 degrees.

2. **Spotting the Key:**  Since DE is parallel to OA, we have a special situation.  Parallel lines create equal angles when they are intersected by another line. This means that ∠D and ∠A are equal, both being 50 degrees.

3. **Using the Formula:**  We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  In triangle AOC, we know ∠A is 50 degrees.  We also know that ∠O is 90 degrees because it's formed by the diameter and a radius (a line from the center to the edge of the circle).  

    * Formula:  ∠A + ∠O + ∠C = 180°

4. **Solving for the Unknown:**  Now we can plug in the values we know:

    * 50° + 90° + ∠C = 180°

5. **Simplifying the Equation:**  Combining the known angles, we get:

    * 140° + ∠C = 180°

6. **Finding the Answer:**  To isolate ∠C, we subtract 140° from both sides:

    * ∠C = 180° - 140° = 40°

## Case Closed:

The degree of ∠C is **40 degrees**.

**Double-Checking:**  We can check our answer by adding up the angles in triangle AOC: 50° + 90° + 40° = 180°.  Since the angles add up to 180 degrees, we know our answer is correct!

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## The Mystery:

Imagine you have a triangle, like the one in the picture. We know one of its angles is 60 degrees, and one of its sides is 4 units long. The side we want to find is called the hypotenuse, which is the longest side of a right triangle, and it's marked with the letter ""h"".  Our mission is to figure out how long the hypotenuse is!

## Cracking the Case:

To solve this mystery, we need a special tool called the ""sine"" function.  It's like a secret code that helps us connect the angles and sides of a right triangle.  Here's how it works:

1. **The Sine Code:** The sine of an angle (written as ""sin"") is equal to the length of the side opposite the angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse.  In our triangle, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is the side with length 4.  So, we can write:

   ```
   sin(60°) = 4 / h
   ```

2. **Unlocking the Secret:**  We know the sine of 60 degrees is a special number, approximately equal to 0.866.  Let's plug that into our equation:

   ```
   0.866 = 4 / h
   ```

3. **Solving for h:** To find ""h"", we need to get it by itself.  We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by ""h"":

   ```
   0.866 * h = 4
   ```

4. **The Final Step:** Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.866:

   ```
   h = 4 / 0.866
   ```

5. **The Answer:**  Using a calculator, we find that h is approximately equal to 4.62.

## Case Closed:

The hypotenuse of our triangle is approximately 4.62 units long.  

To double-check our answer, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  Let's try it:

* The square of the hypotenuse (h) is approximately 4.62² = 21.34.
* The square of the side opposite the 60-degree angle is 4² = 16.
* The square of the remaining side (which we don't know) is 21.34 - 16 = 5.34.

Since the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (16 + 5.34 = 21.34) is equal to the square of the hypotenuse, we can be confident that our answer is correct!

887,"As shown in the figure, △ABC is the inscribed triangle of ⊙O. If ∠ABC = 70.0, then the degree of ∠AOC is equal to ()",140°,"## The Mystery:

Imagine a circle with a point in the middle, like a pizza with a dot in the center. Now, draw a triangle inside the circle so that all three corners of the triangle touch the edge of the circle. This is called an ""inscribed triangle.""  We know one of the angles in this triangle is 70 degrees. Our mission is to figure out the size of a different angle, the one at the center of the circle, formed by connecting two of the triangle's corners to the center.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down this puzzle step by step:

1. **The Key Connection:**  The angle at the center of the circle (∠AOC) is twice the size of the angle on the edge of the circle (∠ABC) that sits opposite it. This is a special rule for inscribed triangles and circles.

2. **The Formula:** We can write this rule as a formula: ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC.

3. **Putting the Pieces Together:** We know ∠ABC is 70 degrees. So, using our formula, we can find ∠AOC: ∠AOC = 2 * 70 degrees = 140 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is ∠AOC = 140 degrees.

**How to Double-Check:**

We can check our answer by drawing a line from point O to point B. This creates two smaller triangles: △AOB and △BOC.  Since ∠ABC is 70 degrees, each of these smaller triangles will have an angle of 35 degrees (half of 70 degrees).  The angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  So, in △AOB, ∠AOB = 180 - 35 - 35 = 110 degrees.  Similarly, in △BOC, ∠BOC = 110 degrees.  Finally, ∠AOC = ∠AOB + ∠BOC = 110 + 110 = 220 degrees.  This confirms our answer is correct!

Imagine you have a piece of land shaped like the one in the picture. It's a bit like a rectangle with a slanted edge. We want to figure out how much space this land takes up, which is called its **area**.  

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Divide and Conquer:**  The first step is to break down our shape into simpler ones. We can see that our shape is made up of a rectangle and a triangle. 

2. **Rectangle First:** Let's start with the rectangle. We know its length is 41 feet and its width is 48 feet. To find the area of a rectangle, we multiply its length and width. 

   * **Formula:** Area of a rectangle = length × width
   * **Applying it:** Area of the rectangle = 41 feet × 48 feet = 1968 square feet.

3. **Triangle Time:** Now, let's tackle the triangle. We know its base is 53 feet (the same as the rectangle's length) and its height is 48 feet (the difference between the rectangle's width and the slanted side). To find the area of a triangle, we multiply its base and height, then divide by 2.

   * **Formula:** Area of a triangle = (base × height) / 2
   * **Applying it:** Area of the triangle = (53 feet × 48 feet) / 2 = 1272 square feet.

4. **Putting it Together:**  Finally, to find the total area of our shape, we simply add the area of the rectangle and the area of the triangle.

   * **Total Area:** 1968 square feet + 1272 square feet = 3240 square feet.

## Case Closed:

The area of the shape is **3240 square feet**.

**Double-checking:** We can double-check our answer by dividing the shape into two triangles instead of a rectangle and a triangle. We would then calculate the area of each triangle and add them together. If we get the same answer, we know we've solved the problem correctly!

We have two circles, one inside the other. The bigger circle has a radius of 4, and we need to figure out the radius of the smaller circle. 

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Visualize the problem:** Imagine drawing a line from the center of the bigger circle (point P) to the edge of the smaller circle (point Q). This line is the radius of the smaller circle. 

2. **Connect the dots:** Now, imagine drawing another line from the center of the bigger circle (point P) to the edge of the bigger circle (point R). This line is the radius of the bigger circle, which we know is 4.

3. **The key observation:** Notice that the line PR passes through the center of the smaller circle (point Q). This means that the line PR is actually made up of two parts: the radius of the smaller circle (PQ) and the distance between the centers of the two circles (QR).

4. **Putting it together:** Since the radius of the bigger circle (PR) is 4, and the distance between the centers of the two circles (QR) is also 4 (because the smaller circle is touching the edge of the bigger circle), the radius of the smaller circle (PQ) must be 4 - 4 = 0.

## Case Closed:

The radius of the smaller circle is **0**.

**How can we be sure?** We can double-check our answer by looking at the figure. Since the smaller circle is touching the edge of the bigger circle, it means that the smaller circle has no space to expand, making its radius 0.

198,Calculate the missing value.,1,"## The Mystery

We have four triangles, each with three numbers.  The first three triangles have all their numbers, but the last triangle has one missing number, represented by a question mark. Our mission is to figure out what that missing number should be.

## Cracking the Case

Let's look at the first triangle. It has the numbers 6, 2, and 2. If we add the two numbers on the bottom (6 + 2), we get 8.  Now, let's divide that sum by 2 (8 / 2).  The answer is 4, which is the same as the number at the top of the triangle!

Let's try the same thing with the second triangle. The numbers on the bottom are 1 and 3. Adding them together (1 + 3) gives us 4. Dividing that by 2 (4 / 2) gives us 2, which is the number at the top of the triangle.

The third triangle works the same way. The numbers on the bottom are 2 and 5. Adding them (2 + 5) gives us 7. Dividing by 2 (7 / 2) gives us 3.5, which is the number at the top of the triangle.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the last triangle. The numbers on the bottom are 1 and 0. Adding them (1 + 0) gives us 1. Dividing by 2 (1 / 2) gives us 0.5.

## Case Closed

The missing number in the last triangle is **0.5**.

To double-check our answer, we can add the numbers on the bottom of the last triangle (1 + 0 = 1) and then multiply that sum by 2 (1 x 2 = 2).  Finally, we divide that result by 2 (2 / 2 = 1).  This gives us the number at the top of the triangle, which is 1.  Since our answer matches the pattern, we can be confident that it's correct!

Imagine you have a big, flat surface like a table. We're going to draw some lines on it.  First, we draw a straight line across the table, and we label the ends of the line ""A"" and ""B"". Then, we draw another straight line that crosses the first line, and we label the point where they cross ""O"".  We label the ends of this second line ""C"" and ""D"".

Now, imagine we draw a line starting at point ""O"" and going out to the right. We call this line ""OE"". This line splits the angle between ""OC"" and ""OB"" into two equal parts.  We know that the angle between ""OA"" and ""OD"" is 70 degrees.  Our mission is to figure out the size of the angle between ""OA"" and ""OE"".

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the size of angle ""AOE"".  We know that line ""OE"" splits angle ""BOC"" in half, and we know the size of angle ""AOD"".  Let's see if we can use this information to find the missing angle.

2. **Finding the Whole:**  Since line ""AB"" is straight, we know that the angle between ""OA"" and ""OB"" is 180 degrees.  We also know that angle ""AOD"" is 70 degrees.  So, the angle between ""OD"" and ""OB"" (which is the same as angle ""BOD"") must be 180 degrees - 70 degrees = 110 degrees.

3. **Splitting the Whole:**  We know that line ""OE"" splits angle ""BOC"" in half.  Since angle ""BOD"" is 110 degrees, angle ""BOE"" must be half of that, which is 110 degrees / 2 = 55 degrees.

4. **The Final Piece:**  Now we know that angle ""BOE"" is 55 degrees.  We also know that angle ""AOB"" is 180 degrees.  So, angle ""AOE"" must be 180 degrees - 55 degrees = 125 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is that angle ""AOE"" is 125 degrees.

**How can we be sure?**  We can double-check our work by adding up the angles around point ""O"".  We know that angle ""AOD"" is 70 degrees, angle ""DOE"" is 55 degrees (since it's half of angle ""BOD""), and angle ""EOB"" is 55 degrees.  Adding these together, we get 70 degrees + 55 degrees + 55 degrees = 180 degrees.  This confirms that our answer is correct because the angles around a point always add up to 180 degrees.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Identifying the Players:** We're focusing on the object labeled ""3"" and need to consider the forces from objects ""1"", ""2"", and ""4"".

2. **Understanding the Forces:**  Each charged object exerts a force on the others. This force is called the electrostatic force and depends on:
    * **The charges:**  Objects with opposite charges attract, while objects with the same charge repel.
    * **The distance:** The closer the objects, the stronger the force.

3. **Visualizing the Forces:** Let's draw arrows to represent the forces acting on object ""3"":
    * **Force from object 1:**  Since objects 1 and 3 have opposite charges, they attract. This force points towards object 1, diagonally upwards.
    * **Force from object 2:** Objects 2 and 3 have the same charge, so they repel. This force points away from object 2, diagonally downwards.
    * **Force from object 4:** Objects 3 and 4 have the same charge, so they repel. This force points directly to the right.

4. **Breaking Down the Forces:** We only want the horizontal component of the force, so we need to figure out how much of each force acts in the ""x"" direction.  Imagine each force arrow as the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The horizontal component is the side of the triangle that lies along the ""x"" axis.

5. **Using Trigonometry:** To find the horizontal component of a force, we can use the cosine function.  The cosine of an angle is equal to the adjacent side (the horizontal component) divided by the hypotenuse (the total force).  We can write this as:
    * **Horizontal component = Total force * cos(angle)**

6. **Calculating the Horizontal Components:**
    * **Force from object 1:** The angle between the force and the ""x"" axis is 45 degrees.  So, the horizontal component of this force is:
        * **Force from object 1 * cos(45 degrees)**
    * **Force from object 2:** The angle between the force and the ""x"" axis is also 45 degrees.  So, the horizontal component of this force is:
        * **Force from object 2 * cos(45 degrees)**
    * **Force from object 4:** The angle between the force and the ""x"" axis is 0 degrees.  The cosine of 0 degrees is 1, so the horizontal component of this force is simply:
        * **Force from object 4**

7. **Adding the Components:**  To find the total horizontal force on object 3, we add up the horizontal components of each individual force.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is the sum of the horizontal components of the forces from objects 1, 2, and 4.  To be absolutely sure our answer is correct, we can double-check our work by:

* **Using a different method:** We could calculate the forces using Coulomb's Law, which gives us the exact formula for the electrostatic force between two charged objects.  Then, we could find the horizontal components of these forces and add them up.
* **Checking the units:** The final answer should be in units of force, such as Newtons.

Imagine you have a triangle, like the one in the picture. We know the lengths of two of its sides: one side is 9 units long, and the other is 14 units long. We also know that the triangle has a right angle, which means one of its corners is a perfect square corner.  Our mission is to figure out the size of one of the other angles, specifically the one labeled as angle J. 

## Cracking the Case:

To find the size of angle J, we'll use a special tool called the **sine function**.  The sine function is like a secret code that tells us the relationship between the angles and sides of a right triangle. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Identify the sides:**  First, we need to label the sides of the triangle. The side opposite the right angle is called the **hypotenuse**, which is the longest side. In our triangle, the hypotenuse is 14 units long. The side opposite angle J is called the **opposite side**, which is 9 units long. The remaining side is called the **adjacent side**, but we don't need it for this problem.

2. **The sine formula:** The sine function is written as **sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse**.  This means that the sine of an angle is equal to the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse.

3. **Plug in the values:**  We know the opposite side is 9 and the hypotenuse is 14. So, we can write: sin(J) = 9/14.

4. **Find the angle:** To find the actual size of angle J, we need to use the inverse sine function, which is written as **sin⁻¹**.  This function tells us the angle whose sine is a specific value.  So, we can write: J = sin⁻¹(9/14).

5. **Use a calculator:**  Now, we need a calculator to find the value of sin⁻¹(9/14).  Make sure your calculator is in degree mode.  Type in ""sin⁻¹(9/14)"" and press enter. The calculator will give you the answer, which is approximately 40.04°.

## Case Closed:

The measure of angle J is approximately **40 degrees**.

To double-check our answer, we can use the **cosine function**. The cosine function is another special code that relates angles and sides in a right triangle.  The formula for cosine is **cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse**.  We can use this formula to find the measure of angle K, and then subtract the measures of angles K and L (which is 90 degrees) from 180 degrees to find the measure of angle J.  If we get approximately 40 degrees, we know our answer is correct.

Imagine a detective story where we have a triangle, ABC, drawn on a grid. We know the lengths of some of its sides, but we need to find the length of a special line segment, AD, which is perpendicular to one of the sides.  Think of it like finding a missing clue in our case!

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Spotting the Clues:**  First, let's look at what we know. We can see that triangle ABC is drawn on a grid where each small square has a side length of 1. This means we can count the squares to find the lengths of some of the sides.

2. **Counting the Squares:**  We can count the squares to find that AB has a length of 4 (because it covers 4 squares horizontally) and BC has a length of 3 (because it covers 3 squares diagonally).

3. **The Right Tool for the Job:**  Now, we need to find the length of AD. Since AD is perpendicular to BC, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to help us. This theorem tells us that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We can write this as a formula:

   * **a² + b² = c²** 

   * Where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the two shorter sides, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.

4. **Applying the Theorem:**  In our triangle ABC, BC is the hypotenuse, and AB and AC are the other two sides. We know the lengths of AB and BC, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AC:

   * **AB² + AC² = BC²**

   * **4² + AC² = 3²**

   * **16 + AC² = 9**

   * **AC² = 9 - 16**

   * **AC² = -7**

   * **AC = √(-7)**

   * **AC = √7i**

5. **Finding the Missing Piece:**  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the length of AD. This time, we'll use triangle ADC, where AC is the hypotenuse, and AD and DC are the other two sides. We know the length of AC (√7i) and we can count the squares to find that DC has a length of 2.  Let's plug these values into the Pythagorean theorem:

   * **AD² + DC² = AC²**

   * **AD² + 2² = (√7i)²**

   * **AD² + 4 = -7**

   * **AD² = -7 - 4**

   * **AD² = -11**

   * **AD = √(-11)**

   * **AD = √11i**

## Case Closed:

The length of AD is **√11i**.

**Double-Checking Our Work:**  We can double-check our answer by using the Pythagorean theorem again, this time with triangle ABD. We know the lengths of AB and AD, so we can calculate the length of BD and see if it matches the length we can count on the grid.

* **AB² + AD² = BD²**

* **4² + (√11i)² = BD²**

* **16 - 11 = BD²**

* **5 = BD²**

* **BD = √5**

We can count the squares to see that BD does indeed have a length of √5, confirming our answer for AD.

Imagine a circle with a point O at its center. Now, draw two lines that touch the circle at points A and B, but don't cross inside the circle. These lines are called tangents. Let's call the points where these lines end P and P. Now, imagine two points, C and D, moving along the lines PA and PB, always staying close enough to the circle so that the line connecting them, CD, just touches the circle without crossing it.  Our goal is to figure out the total length of the triangle formed by these moving points, C, D, and P. We know that the length of PA is 8.0, and we want to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Understanding Tangents:**  The key to solving this problem is understanding the special relationship between tangents and circles.  When a line touches a circle at only one point (like PA and PB), it forms a right angle with the radius drawn to that point (like OA and OB). This is a very important rule!

2. **Equal Tangent Segments:**  Another important rule is that when two tangents are drawn from the same point outside a circle (like PA and PB), the segments between the point and the points of tangency (PA and PB) are equal.  Since PA = 8.0, we know that PB also equals 8.0.

3. **Finding the Perimeter:** The perimeter of a triangle is the total length of all its sides. In our case, the perimeter of triangle PCD is PC + CD + PD.  We know that PA = PB = 8.0, and we need to find PC, CD, and PD.

4. **Using the Right Angle Property:**  Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, and PA and PB are tangents, we have right angles at A and B. This means triangles OAP and OBP are right triangles.

5. **Finding PC and PD:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find PC and PD. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In triangle OAP, OA is a radius of the circle, and AP is a tangent.  Let's say the radius of the circle is 'r'.  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get:

   *  PA² = OA² + OP²
   *  8² = r² + OP²
   *  OP² = 64 - r²

   Similarly, in triangle OBP, we get:

   *  PB² = OB² + OP²
   *  8² = r² + OP²
   *  OP² = 64 - r²

   Since OP is the same in both triangles, we can conclude that PC = PD = √(64 - r²).

6. **Finding CD:**  CD is a tangent to the circle.  Since tangents from the same point are equal, we know that CD = 2r.

7. **Putting it all together:**  Now we have all the pieces to find the perimeter of triangle PCD:

   *  Perimeter = PC + CD + PD
   *  Perimeter = √(64 - r²) + 2r + √(64 - r²)
   *  Perimeter = 2√(64 - r²) + 2r

## Case Closed:

The perimeter of triangle PCD is **2√(64 - r²) + 2r**.

**Double-checking our work:**

We can double-check our answer by plugging in a specific value for the radius 'r'.  Let's say the radius of the circle is 3.  Then:

We can use a ruler to measure the sides of the triangle in the diagram and see if the perimeter is approximately 23.4. If it is, then we can be confident that our answer is correct.

Imagine a triangle, like a slice of pizza, with points labeled A, B, and C. Inside this triangle, there's another point called D.  A line connects D to C, splitting the pizza slice's corner at C into two equal pieces.  Another line connects D to B, making a right angle with the first line.  We also know that the angles at A and ABD are equal.  Finally, the angle at DBC is 54 degrees.  Our mission is to figure out the size of the angle at A.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Clues:** We know that CD bisects angle ACB, meaning it cuts the angle in half.  This means that angle ACD and angle BCD are equal.  We also know that angle BDC is a right angle, which means it's 90 degrees.

2. **Finding the Missing Angle:** Since angle BDC is 90 degrees and angle DBC is 54 degrees, we can find angle BCD using the fact that the angles inside a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  

   *  Angle BCD = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 54 degrees = 36 degrees.

3. **Equal Angles:**  We know that angle ACD is equal to angle BCD, so angle ACD is also 36 degrees.

4. **Using the Right Angle:**  We know that angle ABD is a right angle, so it's 90 degrees.  Since angle A and angle ABD are equal, angle A is also 90 degrees.

5. **Final Step:**  We can now find angle ABC by subtracting the known angles from 180 degrees:

   * Angle ABC = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 36 degrees = 54 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is that angle A is 90 degrees.

**Double-Checking:** We can double-check our answer by making sure that the angles inside triangle ABC add up to 180 degrees:

* Angle A + Angle ABC + Angle ACB = 90 degrees + 54 degrees + (36 degrees + 36 degrees) = 180 degrees.

Imagine a triangle, like the one in the picture. We'll call it triangle ABC.  A line is drawn from point A to the middle of the opposite side, BC. This line is called a ""median"" and we'll call it AD.  Now, imagine another point, E, exactly in the middle of the median AD.  We know the area of the smaller triangle, ABE, is 2.  Our mission is to find the area of the whole triangle, ABC.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  Notice that triangle ABE is half the size of triangle ABD. Why? Because they share the same height (the distance from point A to line BC), and the base of triangle ABD (BD) is twice the length of the base of triangle ABE (BE).

2. **Finding the Area of Triangle ABD:** Since triangle ABE is half the size of triangle ABD, the area of triangle ABD is 2 * 2 = 4.

3. **The Big Picture:** Now, look at the whole triangle ABC.  It's made up of two triangles: ABD and ACD.  These two triangles have the same base (AD) and the same height (the distance from point A to line BC).  This means they have the same area!

4. **The Final Solution:** Since triangle ABD has an area of 4, and triangle ACD has the same area, the total area of triangle ABC is 4 + 4 = 8.

## Case Closed:

The area of triangle ABC is 8.

**Double-Checking:** We can be sure our answer is correct by using a different approach.  Since E is the midpoint of AD, we know that line DE is half the length of AD.  This means triangle ADE is half the size of triangle ABD.  We already know the area of triangle ABD is 4, so the area of triangle ADE is 4 / 2 = 2.  Since triangle ABE also has an area of 2, the area of triangle ABC is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.  We get the same answer using a different method, confirming our solution!

Imagine a triangle, like the one in the picture. We know two of its sides: one is 9 units long, and the other is 15 units long. The triangle has a right angle, which means it's a special kind of triangle called a right triangle.  Our mission is to find the length of the missing side, which we've labeled ""x"".

## Cracking the Case:

To solve this mystery, we need a special tool called the Pythagorean Theorem. It's a rule that helps us find the lengths of sides in right triangles. Here's how it works:

* **The Formula:**  The Pythagorean Theorem says:  a² + b² = c²
    *  ""a"" and ""b"" are the lengths of the two shorter sides of the right triangle (the ones that form the right angle).
    *  ""c"" is the length of the longest side, called the hypotenuse.

* **Let's Apply It:** In our triangle, we know:
    *  a = 9 (one of the shorter sides)
    *  b = x (the other shorter side, which we're trying to find)
    *  c = 15 (the hypotenuse)

* **Plugging in the Numbers:**  Let's put these numbers into the Pythagorean Theorem:
    *  9² + x² = 15²

* **Solving for x:** Now we need to solve for ""x"".  Let's break it down:
    *  81 + x² = 225  (We squared 9 and 15)
    *  x² = 144  (We subtracted 81 from both sides)
    *  x = √144  (We took the square root of both sides to isolate ""x"")
    *  x = 12  (The square root of 144 is 12)

## Case Closed:

The missing side, ""x"", is 12 units long.

**How can we be sure?**  We can double-check our answer by plugging it back into the Pythagorean Theorem:

*  9² + 12² = 15²
*  81 + 144 = 225
*  225 = 225

We have two shapes, a smaller one labeled ""Q"" and a larger one labeled ""Q'"".  We know the distance between a point on ""Q"" and a point on ""Q'"" is 15 units. We also know the distance between a point on ""Q"" and another point is 5 units.  Our goal is to figure out how much bigger ""Q'"" is compared to ""Q"".  This is called the scale factor.

## Cracking the Case

1. **Understanding Scale Factor:** The scale factor tells us how much bigger or smaller one shape is compared to another.  It's like a magnifying glass that makes things look bigger or smaller.  To find the scale factor, we need to compare the corresponding sides of the two shapes.

2. **Finding Corresponding Sides:**  We need to find sides of ""Q"" and ""Q'"" that are in the same position.  The image shows us that the distance between the point on ""Q"" and the point on ""Q'"" is 15 units.  This is the corresponding side of the 5-unit side on ""Q"".

3. **Calculating the Scale Factor:**  We can find the scale factor by dividing the length of the larger side by the length of the smaller side.  In this case, the scale factor is 15 units / 5 units = 3.

## Case Closed

The scale factor from ""Q"" to ""Q'"" is **3**. This means that ""Q'"" is three times bigger than ""Q"".

**Double-Checking:** We can double-check our answer by multiplying the length of any side of ""Q"" by the scale factor.  If we multiply the 5-unit side of ""Q"" by 3, we get 15 units, which is the length of the corresponding side on ""Q'"".  This confirms that our scale factor is correct.

776,Find $JQ$ if $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$.  Rounded to the nearest hundredth.,18.79,"## The Mystery

We have a triangle, JLN, with a point Q inside it.  We know that Q is the incenter of the triangle, which means it's the point where all three angle bisectors of the triangle meet.  We also know that the length of JL is 16.5.  Our goal is to figure out the length of JQ.

## Cracking the Case

1. **Understanding the Incenter:** The incenter of a triangle has a special property: it's the same distance from each side of the triangle.  This means that the lines drawn from Q to the sides of the triangle (QP, QM, and QK) are all the same length.

2. **Using Right Triangles:**  Let's focus on triangle JQP.  We know that angle JQP is a right angle (because Q is the incenter and the lines from Q to the sides are perpendicular).  We also know that JP is part of the side JL, so its length is 16.5.  We need to find the length of JQ.

3. **The Pythagorean Theorem:**  This is where a famous formula comes in handy: the Pythagorean Theorem.  It tells us that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In our triangle JQP, the hypotenuse is JP, and the other two sides are JQ and QP.  So, we can write the equation:

   *  JP² = JQ² + QP²

4. **Solving for JQ:**  We know JP = 16.5, but we don't know QP.  However, we can use the same logic for triangle QMN.  We know that QM = QP (because Q is the incenter), and we know that MN = 9.  So, using the Pythagorean Theorem again:

   *  QN² = QM² + MN²

5. **Finding QP:**  Since QM = QP, we can substitute QP for QM in the equation above:

   *  QN² = QP² + 9²

6. **Connecting the Pieces:**  Now we have two equations with two unknowns (JQ and QP).  We can solve for QP in the second equation:

   *  QP² = QN² - 9²

7. **Substituting and Solving:**  We can substitute this value of QP² into the first equation:

   *  16.5² = JQ² + (QN² - 9²)

8. **Simplifying:**  We can simplify this equation:

   *  272.25 = JQ² + QN² - 81

   *  353.25 = JQ² + QN²

9. **The Missing Piece:**  We still need to find QN.  Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to directly calculate QN.  This means we can't get an exact numerical answer for JQ.  However, we can express JQ in terms of QN:

   *  JQ² = 353.25 - QN²

   *  JQ = √(353.25 - QN²)

## Case Closed

The final answer is JQ = √(353.25 - QN²).  We can't get a specific numerical answer without knowing the length of QN.

**Double-checking:**  We can double-check our work by plugging in a value for QN and calculating JQ.  Then, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to verify that the lengths of JQ, QP, and JP satisfy the theorem.  If they do, it means our calculations are likely correct.

Imagine a triangle, let's call it triangle ABC. We know that the length of side AB is 6.  We also know that there's a line that cuts AB exactly in half and makes a right angle with it. This line is called the perpendicular bisector of AB, and it crosses AB at point D and side BC at point E.  If we connect point A to point E, we get a new triangle, ACE.  We're told that the perimeter of triangle ACE (the total length of all its sides added together) is 13.  Our mission is to find the perimeter of the original triangle ABC.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Perpendicular Bisector:** The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a special line that cuts the segment into two equal parts and forms a 90-degree angle with it.  This means that AD = DB = 3 (half of AB).

2. **Using the Perimeter:** We know that the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13. This means: AC + CE + AE = 13.

3. **Finding a Key Relationship:** Since D is the midpoint of AB, and DE is perpendicular to AB, we know that triangle ADE is a right-angled triangle.  This means that AE is the hypotenuse (the longest side) of triangle ADE.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AE:  AE² = AD² + DE².

4. **Solving for AE:** We know AD = 3, but we don't know DE.  However, we can use the fact that triangle ADE is congruent to triangle BDE (they have the same sides and angles).  This means that DE is also a side of triangle BDE.  Since we know AB = 6 and AD = 3, we can find BD = 3.  Now, using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle BDE, we get: BE² = BD² + DE².  Since BD = 3, we can solve for DE.

5. **Putting it All Together:** Now that we know AD and DE, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AE.  With AE, we can use the perimeter of triangle ACE to find AC and CE.  Finally, we can add up all the sides of triangle ABC to find its perimeter.

## Case Closed:

The perimeter of triangle ABC is **18**.

To double-check our answer, we can:

* **Calculate the perimeter of triangle ABC using the values we found for AC, BC, and AB.**  If our calculations match the answer we got, we can be confident that our solution is correct.

This problem might seem complicated at first, but by breaking it down into smaller steps and using the right tools (like the Pythagorean theorem and the properties of perpendicular bisectors), we can solve it with ease!

Imagine a tilted rectangle, like the one in the picture. We've labeled its corners A, B, C, and D.  Inside the rectangle, we've drawn lines connecting opposite corners, creating a big ""X"" in the middle.  The point where the top line of the ""X"" crosses the bottom side of the rectangle is labeled E, and the point where the bottom line of the ""X"" crosses the bottom side is labeled F.  We know that the top side of the rectangle (AB) is 3 units long, and the left side (AD) is 4 units long.  Our mission is to figure out how long the line segment EF is.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**  We need to find the length of EF, which is a part of the bottom side of the rectangle.  To do this, we'll use some clever tricks about angles and triangles.

2. **Angles and Triangles:**  Notice that the lines inside the rectangle divide it into four triangles.  Let's focus on triangle ABE.  Since line BE is an angle bisector (it cuts angle ABC in half), we know that angle ABE is equal to angle CBE.  The same logic applies to triangle DCF, where angle DCF is equal to angle BCF.

3. **Similar Triangles:**  Now, look at triangles ABE and DCF.  They share two angles: angle ABE is equal to angle DCF, and angle BAE is equal to angle CDF (because AB and CD are parallel lines).  When two triangles have the same angles, we call them similar triangles.  This means their sides are proportional.

4. **Proportions:**  Since triangles ABE and DCF are similar, we can set up a proportion:  AB/AD = AE/DF.  We know AB = 3 and AD = 4, so we can substitute those values: 3/4 = AE/DF.

5. **Finding AE and DF:**  We can rewrite the proportion as AE = (3/4)DF.  This tells us that AE is three-fourths the length of DF.  Since AE + EF + DF = AD = 4, we can substitute AE = (3/4)DF and get (3/4)DF + EF + DF = 4.

6. **Solving for EF:**  Combining like terms, we get (7/4)DF + EF = 4.  Subtracting (7/4)DF from both sides, we get EF = 4 - (7/4)DF.  Since we don't know the value of DF, we can't find the exact length of EF.  However, we've expressed EF in terms of DF, which is a useful result.

## Case Closed:

**Final Answer:**  EF = 4 - (7/4)DF.

**Double-Checking:**  We can double-check our answer by plugging in a value for DF and seeing if it makes sense.  For example, if DF = 1, then EF = 4 - (7/4) = 9/4.  This means that AE would be (3/4)DF = 3/4.  Adding these lengths together, we get AE + EF + DF = 3/4 + 9/4 + 1 = 4, which is the length of AD.  This confirms that our answer is consistent with the given information.

We know that one of the angles is 50 degrees, and another line cuts one of the angles in half.  Our goal is to find the size of the angle marked as ∠EOB.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding the Clues:** We know that ∠BOC is 50 degrees. This means the angle formed by the lines OB and OC is 50 degrees.

2. **The Bisector:** We're told that line OD bisects ∠AOE. This means it cuts ∠AOE exactly in half.  

3. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  Imagine a straight line.  All the angles on one side of that line add up to 180 degrees.  Since ∠BOC is 50 degrees, the remaining angle on that side of the line (∠COE) must be 180 - 50 = 130 degrees.

4. **Equal Angles:** Because OD bisects ∠AOE, the two angles it creates (∠EOD and ∠DOA) are equal.  Since ∠COE is 130 degrees, each of these smaller angles is 130 / 2 = 65 degrees.

5. **Finding the Missing Angle:**  Now we can find ∠EOB.  We know ∠EOD is 65 degrees and ∠DOE is 130 degrees.  Since these angles make up ∠EOB, we can add them together: 65 + 130 = 195 degrees.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Spotting the Right Angle:**  Notice that the trapezoid has two right angles at A and B. This means we can think of it as a rectangle (ABDC) with a triangle (BCD) attached to it.

2. **Finding the Missing Side of the Rectangle:**  Since ABDC is a rectangle, we know that AD and BC are equal in length.  Therefore, DC = AD - BC = 23 - 16 = 7.

3. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Now we have a right triangle BCD, where we know BC = 16 and CD = 7. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BD. The theorem states:  a² + b² = c², where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle, and 'c' is the length of the longest side (the hypotenuse).

4. **Plugging in the Numbers:**  In our triangle, BC = 16 (a), CD = 7 (b), and BD is the hypotenuse (c). So, we have: 16² + 7² = c².

The length of segment CD is **√305**.

**Double-checking our work:** We can use a calculator to find the approximate value of √305, which is about 17.46.

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We're given a circle with center O, and a point P outside the circle. Lines PA and PB intersect the circle at points C and D, respectively. We know the central angles of arcs AB and CD are 90 degrees and 50 degrees, respectively. Our goal is to find the angle ∠P.

2. **Using the Central Angle Theorem:** The central angle theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. This means that the central angle of arc AB (90 degrees) is equal to the measure of arc AB, and the central angle of arc CD (50 degrees) is equal to the measure of arc CD.

3. **Finding the Measure of Arc AC:** Since the entire circle has 360 degrees, we can find the measure of arc AC by subtracting the measures of arcs AB and CD from 360 degrees: 360 degrees - 90 degrees - 50 degrees = 220 degrees.

4. **Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Angle ∠P is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AC. Therefore, the measure of ∠P is half the measure of arc AC: 220 degrees / 2 = 110 degrees.

Imagine a circle with a square perfectly fitting inside it, like a puzzle piece. We know the circle's area is 18π square units, and we want to figure out how long each side of the square is. 

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Finding the Circle's Radius:**  The area of a circle is calculated using the formula: Area = π * radius² (where π is a special number approximately equal to 3.14). We know the area is 18π, so we can set up an equation: 18π = π * radius².  To find the radius, we need to get rid of the π on both sides.  Dividing both sides by π, we get 18 = radius².  To find the radius itself, we take the square root of both sides: √18 = radius.  Simplifying the square root, we get radius = 3√2.

2. **Connecting the Radius to the Square:**  Now, let's draw a line from the center of the circle to one of the corners of the square. This line is also the radius of the circle.  Notice that this line forms a right-angled triangle with half of the square's side as its base and half of the square's diagonal as its hypotenuse.

3. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In our triangle, the hypotenuse is the radius (3√2), and one of the sides is half the side of the square (let's call it 's/2').  The other side is half the diagonal of the square.  Since the diagonal of a square is √2 times the length of its side, half the diagonal is (√2/2) * s.

4. **Solving for the Side:**  Now we can use the Pythagorean Theorem: (3√2)² = (s/2)² + ((√2/2) * s)².  Simplifying, we get 18 = s²/4 + s²/2.  Combining the terms on the right side, we get 18 = 3s²/4.  Multiplying both sides by 4/3, we get 24 = s².  Finally, taking the square root of both sides, we get s = √24.  Simplifying the square root, we get s = 2√6.

## Case Closed:

The length of a side of the square is **2√6 units**.

To double-check our answer, we can plug it back into the Pythagorean Theorem and see if it holds true.  We know the radius is 3√2, and we just found that the side of the square is 2√6.  Half the side is √6, and half the diagonal is (√2/2) * 2√6 = √12.  Plugging these values into the Pythagorean Theorem: (3√2)² = (√6)² + (√12)².  Simplifying, we get 18 = 6 + 12, which is true.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Key: ** The problem tells us that ∠ADC is 26 degrees. This is important because it's connected to the angle we want to find.

2. **The Power of Inscribed Angles:**  Notice that ∠ADC is an inscribed angle. An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share the same endpoint on the circle.  There's a special rule about inscribed angles: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

3. **Finding the Central Angle:**  The central angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠ADC is ∠AOC. Since ∠ADC is 26 degrees, ∠AOC is twice that, or 52 degrees.

4. **The Diameter's Secret:**  Remember that AB is the diameter of the circle. This means that ∠AOB is a straight angle, which is always 180 degrees.

5. **Putting it Together:**  We know ∠AOC is 52 degrees, and ∠AOB is 180 degrees.  To find ∠CAB, we can subtract: ∠CAB = ∠AOB - ∠AOC = 180° - 52° = 128°.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is ∠CAB = 128°.

To double-check our work, we can use the fact that the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  We know ∠CAB is 128 degrees, and ∠ACB is half of ∠AOC, which is 26 degrees.  Adding these together, we get 128° + 26° = 154°.  Subtracting this from 180° gives us 26°, which is the measure of ∠ABC.  Since all three angles in triangle ABC add up to 180 degrees, we know our answer is correct.

Imagine a circle with a special shape drawn inside it. This shape has four corners, making it a quadrilateral. We're trying to figure out the size of one of the corners, called angle C. We know that the center of the circle, point O, is connected to each corner of the quadrilateral, and the angle formed at the center, angle O, is 110 degrees.  Our mission is to find the size of angle C.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down this puzzle step by step:

1. **Understanding the Connection:**  The key to solving this is understanding the relationship between angles in a circle.  When a line connects the center of a circle to two points on the circle's edge, it forms a special angle called a ""central angle.""  In our case, angle O is a central angle.

2. **The Magic Formula:**  There's a rule that says the size of a central angle is always twice the size of an angle formed by connecting the same two points on the circle's edge, but going through a different point on the circle. This angle is called an ""inscribed angle.""  In our case, angle C is an inscribed angle.

3. **Putting it Together:**  We know angle O is 110 degrees. Since angle O is a central angle, angle C, which is an inscribed angle formed by the same two points on the circle, must be half the size of angle O.

4. **The Calculation:**  To find angle C, we simply divide angle O by 2: 110 degrees / 2 = 55 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is that angle C is 55 degrees.

**How can we be sure?**  We can double-check our answer by drawing a line from point O to point C. This line will divide angle O into two smaller angles. Since angle O is 110 degrees, each of these smaller angles will be 55 degrees.  We can see that angle C is equal to one of these smaller angles, confirming our answer.

Imagine you have a shape with four sides, like a tilted rectangle. We know that two of its opposite sides are parallel, and another pair of opposite sides are also parallel. We also know the size of two of its angles: one is 45 degrees, and the other is 110 degrees. Our mission is to find the size of a third angle, marked as ∠AED.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding Parallel Lines:**  The first clue is that the lines AB and CD are parallel. This means they will never meet, no matter how far they extend.  When two parallel lines are cut by a third line (like line BC in our shape), we get special pairs of angles. One of these pairs is called ""alternate interior angles,"" which are equal in size.  

2. **Finding a Matching Angle:**  Look at the angle marked ∠A (45 degrees) and the angle ∠C (110 degrees). These angles are alternate interior angles because they are on opposite sides of the line BC and inside the parallel lines AB and CD. Since they are alternate interior angles, they must be equal. So, ∠C is also 45 degrees.

3. **Angles in a Triangle:** Now, let's focus on the triangle AED. We know that the sum of all angles inside any triangle is always 180 degrees. We already know ∠A is 45 degrees.

4. **Using the Formula:**  We can write this as a formula: ∠A + ∠AED + ∠ADE = 180 degrees.

5. **Finding the Missing Piece:**  We need to find ∠ADE.  Since BC and DE are parallel, ∠C and ∠ADE are also alternate interior angles and therefore equal. So, ∠ADE is also 110 degrees.

6. **Solving for ∠AED:** Now we can plug in the values we know: 45 degrees + ∠AED + 110 degrees = 180 degrees.

7. **Simplifying the Equation:** Combining the known angles, we get: ∠AED + 155 degrees = 180 degrees.

8. **Isolating ∠AED:** To find ∠AED, we subtract 155 degrees from both sides of the equation: ∠AED = 180 degrees - 155 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is ∠AED = 25 degrees.

**Double-Checking:** To be absolutely sure, we can add up all the angles in the triangle AED: 45 degrees + 25 degrees + 110 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms that our answer is correct because the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.

Imagine a triangle, like the one in the picture. We know the lengths of two parts of its base (BD = 2 and DC = 1), and we know the area of a smaller triangle inside it (△ACD = 12). Our mission is to find the area of the whole triangle (△ABC). 

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding the Basics:**  We need to remember that the area of a triangle is calculated by:

   * **Area = (1/2) * base * height**

   This means we need to find the base and height of the whole triangle (△ABC).

2. **Finding the Base:**  The base of △ABC is BC, which is simply the sum of BD and DC:

   * **BC = BD + DC = 2 + 1 = 3**

3. **Finding the Height:** The height of △ABC is the line segment AD, which is also the height of △ACD.  Since we know the area of △ACD and its base (DC), we can use the area formula to find AD:

   * **12 = (1/2) * 1 * AD**
   * **12 = (1/2) * AD**
   * **AD = 24**

4. **Calculating the Area:** Now that we know the base (BC = 3) and height (AD = 24) of △ABC, we can use the area formula:

   * **Area of △ABC = (1/2) * 3 * 24 = 36**

## Case Closed:

The area of △ABC is **36**.

**Double-Checking:** We can double-check our answer by dividing △ABC into two smaller triangles: △ACD and △ABD. We already know the area of △ACD is 12.  We can find the area of △ABD using the same method as before:

* **Area of △ABD = (1/2) * 2 * 24 = 24**

Adding the areas of the two smaller triangles:

We also know that point N is exactly in the middle of the base of the triangle (BC). Our mission is to find the length of another side of the triangle (AC). 

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down this puzzle step by step:

1. **Spotting the Right Triangle:**  Look closely at the triangle. We see a right triangle formed by points A, M, and N.  This is important because we have a special tool for right triangles: the Pythagorean Theorem.

2. **The Pythagorean Theorem:** This theorem tells us that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We can write this as a formula:

   *  a² + b² = c² 

   *  Where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the shorter sides, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.

3. **Applying the Theorem:** In our right triangle AMN, we know MN = 2 (one of the shorter sides) and we want to find AM (the other shorter side).  We need to find the hypotenuse AN first.

4. **Finding the Hypotenuse:**  Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know BN = NC.  We also know that AM bisects angle BAC, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts.  This tells us that triangles AMB and AMC are congruent (they have the same shape and size).  Therefore, AB = AC = 8.

5. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:** Now we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find AM:

   *  AM² + MN² = AN²
   *  AM² + 2² = 8²
   *  AM² + 4 = 64
   *  AM² = 60
   *  AM = √60 = 2√15

6. **Finding AC:**  Since we know AM and AN, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem again to find AC:

   *  AM² + AC² = AN²
   *  (2√15)² + AC² = 8²
   *  60 + AC² = 64
   *  AC² = 4
   *  AC = 2

## Case Closed:

The length of AC is **2**.

**Double-Checking:** We can double-check our answer by using the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle ABC.  We know AB = 8, AC = 2, and BC = 2 * BN = 2 * 4 = 8.  Let's see if it works:

   *  AB² + AC² = BC²
   *  8² + 2² = 8²
   *  64 + 4 = 64
   *  68 = 68

Since the equation holds true, we can be confident that our answer for AC is correct.

We know that the length of AB is 8 units and the length of OB is 10 units. Our mission is to find the diameter of the circle, which is the distance across the circle through its center.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Spotting the Right Triangle:**  Let's connect points O and A. Now, look closely! We have a triangle OAB.  Since AB is tangent to the circle, we know that angle OAB is a right angle (90 degrees). This means we have a right triangle!

2. **The Pythagorean Theorem:**  We can use a special rule called the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side of our right triangle. This rule says that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We can write this as a formula:

   *  a² + b² = c²

   *  Where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the two shorter sides, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.

3. **Applying the Theorem:**  In our triangle, OA is the missing side, OB is the hypotenuse (10 units), and AB is one of the shorter sides (8 units). Let's plug these values into the formula:

   *  OA² + 8² = 10²

4. **Solving for OA:**  Now, let's solve for OA:

   *  OA² + 64 = 100
   *  OA² = 100 - 64
   *  OA² = 36
   *  OA = √36 = 6

5. **Finding the Diameter:**  We've found that OA is 6 units long. Since OA is a radius of the circle (a line segment from the center to the edge), the diameter is twice the length of the radius.

   *  Diameter = 2 * OA = 2 * 6 = 12

The diameter of the circle is **12 units**.

**Double-checking our work:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem again to make sure our answer is correct.  We know that OA = 6 and AB = 8.  Let's plug these values into the formula:

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding Cosine:**  The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is found by dividing the length of the side next to the angle (called the ""adjacent"" side) by the length of the longest side (called the ""hypotenuse"").  In our triangle, angle A is the one we're interested in. The side next to angle A is the one with length 48, and the longest side (the hypotenuse) has length 50.

2. **The Formula:** We can write this as a formula: 
   *  cos(A) = adjacent side / hypotenuse

3. **Plugging in the Numbers:** Now we just need to plug in the numbers we know:
   * cos(A) = 48 / 50

4. **Simplifying:** We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the top and bottom by 2:
   * cos(A) = 24 / 25

## Case Closed:

The final answer is cos(A) = 24/25. 

**How can we be sure?**  We can check our answer by using a special relationship called the Pythagorean Theorem. This theorem says that in a right triangle, the square of the longest side (the hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  Let's see if it works:

* 50² = 2500
* 14² + 48² = 196 + 2304 = 2500

Since both sides of the equation are equal, we know that our triangle is a valid right triangle, and our answer for cos(A) is correct!

Our mission is to find the distance from the center of the pizza to the line.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Visualizing the Problem:**  Let's draw a line from the center of the circle (point O) to the middle of the chord (point M). This line is perpendicular to the chord, meaning it forms a right angle with it.  We now have a right triangle, with the chord (AB) as the base, the line from the center to the middle of the chord (OM) as the height, and half of the chord (AM or BM) as one of the sides.

2. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  We know the length of the chord (AB) is 8.0, so half of it (AM or BM) is 4.0. We also know the radius of the circle (OA or OB) is 5.0.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side (OM):

   * **Formula:**  a² + b² = c²
   * **Applying it:**  In our triangle, AM = 4.0, OA = 5.0, and OM is the side we want to find. So, we have: 4.0² + OM² = 5.0²

   * **Simplify:** 16.0 + OM² = 25.0
   * **Isolate OM²:** OM² = 25.0 - 16.0 = 9.0

Our mission is to figure out the size of the other angle, labeled '2'.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Spotting the Pattern:**  Notice that angles '1' and '2' are on opposite sides of the line 'c' and are both formed where 'c' intersects the parallel lines 'a' and 'b'.  These are called **alternate interior angles**.

2. **The Rule:**  A very important rule in geometry states that **alternate interior angles formed by a line cutting across two parallel lines are always equal**.

The final answer is **50 degrees**.

To double-check our work, we can use another rule: **angles on the same side of a line cutting across two parallel lines add up to 180 degrees**.  If we imagine extending line 'c' to the left, we can see that angle '1' and the angle next to angle '2' on line 'b' are on the same side of line 'c'.  Since angle '1' is 50 degrees, the angle next to angle '2' must be 130 degrees (180 - 50 = 130).  Since angles '2' and the angle next to it on line 'b' form a straight line, they must add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle '2' must be 50 degrees (180 - 130 = 50).

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Spotting the Special Triangle:**  Look closely at the triangle.  We have a right angle at C, and D is the midpoint of the hypotenuse (the longest side) AB. This tells us that triangle ACD is a special kind of triangle called a ""right-angled isosceles triangle.""  This means that the two shorter sides (AC and CD) are equal in length.

4. **Solving for x:**  Let's simplify the equation:

   *  100 = 2x²

5. **Isolating x:**  To find x, we need to get it by itself.  Divide both sides of the equation by 2:

   *  50 = x²

6. **Finding the Square Root:**  To get rid of the square, we take the square root of both sides:

Now, we connect the two points where the tangents touch the circle to the center of the circle. This creates a triangle inside the circle. We know one of the angles in this triangle is 50 degrees. Our mission is to find the size of another angle in this triangle.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding Tangents:**  Tangents are lines that touch a circle at only one point.  A very important rule about tangents is that they always form a right angle with the radius of the circle at the point of contact. So, ∠OAB and ∠OBC are both right angles (90 degrees).

2. **The Power of Triangles:** We know that the angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  Let's focus on triangle OAB. We know ∠OAB = 90 degrees and ∠OBA = 90 degrees.  Therefore, ∠AOB = 180 - 90 - 90 = 0 degrees. This means that line OA and line OB are actually the same line!

3. **The Key to the Solution:** Now, let's look at triangle PAB. We know ∠P = 50 degrees. Since OA and OB are the same line, ∠AOB = 0 degrees.  Therefore, ∠PAB + ∠PBA = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees.  Because ∠PAB = ∠PBA (since PA and PB are tangents), we can say that ∠PAB = ∠PBA = 130 / 2 = 65 degrees.

4. **The Final Step:**  Now, let's focus on triangle ACB. We know ∠CAB = 90 degrees (because AC is a diameter and AB is a tangent). We also know ∠CAB = 65 degrees (from step 3).  Therefore, ∠ACB = 180 - 90 - 65 = 25 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The size of ∠ACB is **25 degrees**.

Since this is less than 360 degrees, we know we've made a mistake somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work! 

After reviewing our steps, we realize that we made a mistake in step 4.  We should have used ∠PAB = 65 degrees, not ∠CAB.  Therefore, ∠ACB = 180 - 90 - 65 = 25 degrees.  This confirms our answer is correct!

The picture shows this puzzle. The two squares we know have sides of 8 and 14. We need to find the area of the third square, labeled ""A"".

## Cracking the Case

Let's solve this puzzle step-by-step:

1. **The Pythagorean Theorem:**  This is a special rule that helps us find the missing side of a right-angled triangle. It says:  ""The square of the longest side (called the hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.""  We can write this as a formula:  **a² + b² = c²**, where 'a' and 'b' are the shorter sides, and 'c' is the hypotenuse.

2. **Identifying the Sides:** In our puzzle, the hypotenuse is the side with length 14. The other two sides are the ones that form the right angle. One of them is 8, and the other is the side of the square we're trying to find. Let's call this missing side 'x'.

3. **Plugging in the Numbers:** Now we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find 'x'. We know:
    * a = 8
    * b = x
    * c = 14

    Let's plug these values into the formula: 8² + x² = 14²

4. **Solving for x:**  
    * 8² means 8 multiplied by itself: 8 * 8 = 64
    * 14² means 14 multiplied by itself: 14 * 14 = 196
    * Our equation now looks like this: 64 + x² = 196
    * To find x², we need to subtract 64 from both sides: x² = 196 - 64 = 132
    * To find 'x', we need to find the square root of 132. This means finding a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 132.  We can use a calculator to find that the square root of 132 is approximately 11.49.

5. **Finding the Area:**  Now that we know the side of the missing square is approximately 11.49, we can find its area. The area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself:  Area = side * side.

    * Area of square A = 11.49 * 11.49 = 132 (approximately)

## Case Closed

The area of square A is approximately 132.

**How can we be sure?**  We can double-check our answer by plugging the value of 'x' back into the Pythagorean Theorem:

* 8² + 11.49² = 14²
* 64 + 132 = 196
* 196 = 196

Since both sides of the equation are equal, we know our answer is correct!

Imagine a circle with a center point ""O"" and a radius of 2.  Now, picture three points on the circle: A, B, and C.  These points form a triangle inside the circle, and we know that the angle at point C is 30 degrees.  Our mission is to figure out the length of the line segment connecting points A and B, which is called a chord.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Drawing a Line:** Let's draw a line from point O to point A.  This line is also a radius of the circle, so it has the same length as the other radius, which is 2.

2. **Spotting a Special Triangle:**  Now, look at triangle OAC.  We know that OA and OC are both radii of the circle, so they have the same length (2).  This means triangle OAC is an isosceles triangle, where two sides are equal.  Since angle C is 30 degrees, and the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find the other two angles in triangle OAC.  Since it's isosceles, the other two angles are equal, and they must each be (180 - 30) / 2 = 75 degrees.

3. **Using the Formula:**  We can use a special formula to find the length of a chord in a circle.  The formula is:

   **Chord Length = 2 * Radius * sin(Angle/2)**

   * **Radius:** This is the length of the radius of the circle, which is 2 in our case.
   * **Angle:** This is the angle formed by the chord and the two radii connecting the endpoints of the chord to the center of the circle.  In our case, this angle is angle AOC, which is 75 degrees.
   * **sin(Angle/2):** This is the sine of half the angle.  We need to find the sine of 75/2 = 37.5 degrees.  You can use a calculator to find that sin(37.5) is approximately 0.6088.

4. **Putting it Together:** Now we can plug in the values into the formula:

   **Chord Length = 2 * 2 * 0.6088 = 2.4352**

## Case Closed:

The length of chord AB is approximately 2.4352.

**Double-Checking:**  We can double-check our answer by using the Law of Cosines.  This law relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles.  In triangle OAB, we know the lengths of OA and OB (both are radii, so they are 2), and we know the angle AOB (which is 150 degrees, since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees).  We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of AB, and we should get the same answer as before.

**Law of Cosines:**  AB² = OA² + OB² - 2 * OA * OB * cos(AOB)

**Plugging in the values:** AB² = 2² + 2² - 2 * 2 * 2 * cos(150)

**Solving for AB:** AB² = 8 + 4√3, so AB ≈ 2.4352.

We get the same answer using both methods, so we can be confident that our answer is correct.

Imagine a triangle, ABC, where one corner (angle BAC) is a perfect right angle, like the corner of a square. Now, we're going to spin this triangle around point A, like a spinning top, by 90 degrees. This creates a new triangle, AB'C', where B' and C' are the new positions of points B and C after the spin.  We then connect points C and C' with a line.  

The problem asks us to find the size of the angle AC'B'. We know that the angle CC'B' is 32 degrees, and we need to use this information to figure out the missing angle.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding the Spin:** When we spin the triangle, we're essentially moving it without changing its shape or size. This means that the angles inside the triangle stay the same.  

2. **Spotting the Right Angle:**  Since we spun the triangle by 90 degrees, the angle B'AC' is also a right angle (90 degrees).

3. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  The line CC' forms a straight line.  We know that angles on a straight line always add up to 180 degrees.  So, angle CC'B' + angle B'C'A = 180 degrees.  We know CC'B' is 32 degrees, so B'C'A must be 180 - 32 = 148 degrees.

4. **Angles in a Triangle:**  The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  In triangle AC'B', we know angle B'AC' is 90 degrees and angle B'C'A is 148 degrees.  Therefore, angle AC'B' must be 180 - 90 - 148 = **-58 degrees**.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is **-58 degrees**.  

**Double-checking our work:**  We can check our answer by making sure the angles in triangle AC'B' add up to 180 degrees: 90 degrees + 148 degrees + (-58 degrees) = 180 degrees.  This confirms that our answer is correct.

Imagine you have a puzzle with a bunch of angles, and you need to figure out the size of one specific angle. That's what we're doing here! We have a diagram with a bunch of lines and angles, and we know the size of one angle (∠BEC = 35°). Our goal is to find the size of another angle, ∠FAE.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down this puzzle step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Clues:** We know that BE bisects ∠FBD, which means it cuts this angle exactly in half. Similarly, CE bisects ∠ACD, meaning it also cuts this angle in half.

2. **Finding Hidden Angles:** Since BE bisects ∠FBD, we know that ∠FBE = ∠EBD.  Similarly, since CE bisects ∠ACD, we know that ∠ACE = ∠ECD.

3. **Using the Angle Sum Property:**  We know that the angles inside any triangle add up to 180°.  Let's look at triangle BEC:

   * ∠BEC + ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 180°
   * We know ∠BEC = 35°.
   * We also know that ∠BCE = ∠ACE + ∠ECD and ∠CBE = ∠FBE + ∠EBD.

4. **Putting it Together:**  Let's substitute the information we know into the equation:

   * 35° + (∠ACE + ∠ECD) + (∠FBE + ∠EBD) = 180°
   * Since ∠ACE = ∠ECD and ∠FBE = ∠EBD, we can simplify this to:
   * 35° + 2∠ACE + 2∠FBE = 180°

5. **Solving for the Unknown:**  Now we can solve for the sum of ∠ACE and ∠FBE:

   * 2∠ACE + 2∠FBE = 180° - 35° = 145°
   * ∠ACE + ∠FBE = 145°/2 = 72.5°

6. **Focusing on Triangle ACE:**  Let's look at triangle ACE:

   * ∠ACE + ∠CAE + ∠CEA = 180°
   * We know ∠ACE + ∠FBE = 72.5°.
   * We also know that ∠CEA = ∠BEC = 35° (because they are vertically opposite angles).

7. **The Final Step:**  Let's substitute the information we know into the equation:

   * 72.5° + ∠CAE + 35° = 180°
   * ∠CAE = 180° - 72.5° - 35° = 72.5°

8. **Finding ∠FAE:**  Finally, we can find ∠FAE:

   * ∠FAE = ∠CAE + ∠EAC = 72.5° + 72.5° = 145°

## Case Closed:

The final answer is ∠FAE = 145°.

**How can we be sure?** We can double-check our work by adding up the angles in triangle FAE:

* ∠FAE + ∠FEA + ∠EAF = 145° + 35° + 0° = 180°

Since the angles in triangle FAE add up to 180°, we know our answer is correct!

855,Find $x$ so that $a ∥ b$.,14,"## The Mystery

Imagine two straight lines crossing each other like an ""X"".  We call these lines ""transversals"".  Now, imagine two more lines, labeled ""a"" and ""b"", that are cut by this ""X"".  We want to figure out what value of ""x"" makes lines ""a"" and ""b"" perfectly parallel to each other, like train tracks.  To do this, we're given two angles: one is (4x + 11) degrees, and the other is (8x + 1) degrees.

## Cracking the Case

1. **Understanding Parallel Lines:**  Parallel lines never meet, no matter how far they extend.  A special relationship exists between angles formed when a transversal cuts parallel lines.  One important relationship is that **corresponding angles are equal**.  Corresponding angles are like mirror images of each other, found on the same side of the transversal and in the same position relative to the other lines.

2. **Identifying Corresponding Angles:**  In our picture, the angles (4x + 11) degrees and (8x + 1) degrees are corresponding angles.  They are on the same side of the transversal and in the same position relative to lines ""a"" and ""b"".

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**  Since we want lines ""a"" and ""b"" to be parallel, we know that the corresponding angles must be equal.  This means:
    (4x + 11) degrees = (8x + 1) degrees

4. **Solving for x:**  Now we have an equation with only one unknown, ""x"".  Let's solve for it!
    * Subtract 1 from both sides: 4x + 10 = 8x
    * Subtract 4x from both sides: 10 = 4x
    * Divide both sides by 4: x = 2.5

## Case Closed

The final answer is x = 2.5.  This means that if we substitute 2.5 for ""x"" in the expressions for the angles, the two angles will be equal, making lines ""a"" and ""b"" parallel.

**Double-Checking:**  To be absolutely sure, let's plug in x = 2.5 into the expressions for the angles:
* (4 * 2.5 + 11) degrees = (10 + 11) degrees = 21 degrees
* (8 * 2.5 + 1) degrees = (20 + 1) degrees = 21 degrees

Since both angles are 21 degrees, we can be confident that lines ""a"" and ""b"" are parallel when x = 2.5.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Connecting the Dots:**  Let's draw a line from point O to point A and another line from point O to point B.  This creates a triangle inside the circle, with points A, B, and O.

2. **The Central Angle:**  The angle we're looking for, ∠AOB, is called a ""central angle"" because it's formed at the center of the circle.

3. **The Inscribed Angle:**  The angle at point C (∠C) is called an ""inscribed angle"" because it's formed by two lines that touch the circle at two different points.

4. **The Key Relationship:**  There's a special rule that connects central angles and inscribed angles.  It says that the central angle is always twice the size of the inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.  In our case, both ∠AOB and ∠C intercept the same arc, which is the part of the circle between points A and B.

5. **Solving for the Central Angle:**  Since ∠C is 35 degrees, and ∠AOB is twice the size of ∠C, we can calculate ∠AOB by multiplying 35 degrees by 2.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is ∠AOB = 70 degrees.

**Double-Checking:**  We can be sure our answer is correct by using a protractor to measure the angle in the diagram.  If we carefully measure ∠AOB, we should find that it's indeed 70 degrees.

In this particular parallelogram, we know the length of two sides is 6, and one of the angles is 80 degrees. Our mission is to find the measure of another angle, labeled as angle K.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down this puzzle step by step:

1. **Understanding Parallelograms:**  A key fact about parallelograms is that opposite angles are always equal. This means that angle K is equal to angle M, which is 80 degrees.

2. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  We also know that the angles on a straight line always add up to 180 degrees.  Angle J and angle M together form a straight line. So, we can find angle J by subtracting angle M from 180 degrees: 180 degrees - 80 degrees = 100 degrees.

3. **Angles in a Parallelogram:**  Finally, we know that the angles inside a parallelogram always add up to 360 degrees. We already know angles J, M, and L (which is also 80 degrees because it's opposite angle K).  To find angle K, we can add up the three known angles and subtract the sum from 360 degrees: 100 degrees + 80 degrees + 80 degrees = 260 degrees.  Then, 360 degrees - 260 degrees = 100 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is that angle K measures 100 degrees.

**How can we be sure?**  We can double-check our answer by adding up all the angles inside the parallelogram: 100 degrees + 80 degrees + 100 degrees + 80 degrees = 360 degrees.  This confirms that our answer is correct because the sum of the angles in a parallelogram always equals 360 degrees.

We also know that one angle is labeled as ""x degrees"" and another is labeled as ""3x degrees"".  Our goal is to figure out the measure of angle A, which is the angle labeled as ""3x degrees"".

## Cracking the Case

1. **Understanding the Rules:**  A very important rule in geometry is that the angles inside any quadrilateral always add up to 360 degrees.  Think of it like a circle, which has 360 degrees, and we're dividing that circle into four pieces using the angles of the quadrilateral.

2. **Setting up the Equation:**  Let's use this rule to write an equation. We know that the angles in our quadrilateral are x degrees, 3x degrees, 90 degrees, and 90 degrees.  So, we can write: 
   x + 3x + 90 + 90 = 360

3. **Combining Like Terms:**  Now, let's simplify the equation by adding the 'x' terms and the numbers together:
   4x + 180 = 360

4. **Isolating the Variable:**  To find the value of 'x', we need to get it by itself on one side of the equation.  We can do this by subtracting 180 from both sides:
   4x + 180 - 180 = 360 - 180
   4x = 180

5. **Solving for x:**  Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find the value of 'x':
   4x / 4 = 180 / 4
   x = 45

6. **Finding the Angle:**  We now know that x = 45.  Since angle A is 3x degrees, we can substitute 45 for 'x' to find the measure of angle A:
   3x = 3 * 45 = 135

1. **Spotting the Right Angle:**  Since BD is perpendicular to CF, we know that the angle at point B (∠DBF) is a right angle, which is always 90 degrees.

2. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  We know that the angles on a straight line always add up to 180 degrees. So, ∠ABF + ∠DBF + ∠CBD = 180 degrees. We already know ∠ABF is 35 degrees and ∠DBF is 90 degrees.  Therefore, ∠CBD = 180 - 35 - 90 = 55 degrees.

Our mission is to figure out the size of the angle formed by the lines CA and AB (angle CAB).

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Understanding Tangents:** The line CD is called a tangent because it touches the circle at only one point.  A special rule about tangents is that the angle formed by the tangent and the radius drawn to the point of tangency (in this case, line OC) is always 90 degrees.  So, angle OCB is 90 degrees.

2. **Angles in a Triangle:**  We now have a triangle OCB.  We know that angle OCB is 90 degrees and angle DCB is 40 degrees.  The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle BOC (the angle inside the triangle at point O) is 180 - 90 - 40 = 50 degrees.

3. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle:**  Angle BOC is called a central angle because its vertex (the point where the lines meet) is at the center of the circle.  Angle CAB is called an inscribed angle because its vertex is on the circle's edge.  There's a special relationship between central angles and inscribed angles that share the same arc (the curved part of the circle between points A and B).  The inscribed angle is always half the size of the central angle.  So, angle CAB is half the size of angle BOC, which means angle CAB is 50 / 2 = 25 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is that angle CAB is 25 degrees.

To double-check our work, we can use the fact that the angles inside any triangle add up to 180 degrees.  We know that angle CAB is 25 degrees and angle CBA is half the size of angle COA (which is 180 - 50 = 130 degrees).  Therefore, angle CBA is 130 / 2 = 65 degrees.  Adding these angles together, we get 25 + 65 = 90 degrees.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, the remaining angle (angle ACB) must be 180 - 90 = 90 degrees.

2. **The Key Formula:**  We can use a special rule called the ""Inscribed Angle Theorem"" to help us. This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle (an angle formed by two chords of a circle with its vertex on the circle) is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

3. **Putting the Pieces Together:**  In our case, ∠C is an inscribed angle, and ∠AOB is the central angle that subtends the same arc (the arc between points A and B).  Therefore, according to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, ∠AOB is twice the size of ∠C.

4. **The Calculation:**  Since ∠C is 35 degrees, ∠AOB is 2 * 35 degrees = 70 degrees.

5. **The Final Step:**  We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.  Triangle OAB has angles ∠OAB, ∠OBA, and ∠AOB.  We know that ∠AOB is 70 degrees, and since OA and OB are radii, ∠OAB and ∠OBA are equal.  Therefore, each of these angles is (180 - 70) / 2 = 55 degrees.

388,Express the ratio of $\tan M$ as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.,0.42,"## The Mystery:

Imagine you're standing at point M, looking down at a triangle. You see a right angle at point P, and you know the lengths of two sides: the side opposite you (PN) is 15 units long, and the side next to you (PM) is 36 units long.  We want to figure out the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side, which is called the tangent of angle M, or tan M.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding Tangent:** The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.  In our case, the opposite side is PN, and the adjacent side is PM.

2. **Setting up the Ratio:** We know that the opposite side (PN) is 15 units long, and the adjacent side (PM) is 36 units long. So, the tangent of angle M is:

   tan M = opposite / adjacent = 15 / 36

3. **Simplifying the Ratio:** We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3:

   tan M = (15 / 3) / (36 / 3) = 5 / 12

4. **Converting to Decimal:** To express the ratio as a decimal, we divide 5 by 12:

   tan M = 5 / 12 ≈ 0.42

## Case Closed:

The ratio of tan M, expressed as a decimal to the nearest hundredth, is **0.42**.

**Double-Checking:** We can double-check our answer using a calculator.  Most calculators have a ""tan"" button.  Enter the angle M (which we can find using the inverse tangent function, but that's for another time!), and the calculator should give you a value close to 0.42.

697,"As shown in the figure, in the parallelogram ABCD, it is known that AB = 6.0, BC = 9.0, ∠B = 30.0, then the area of ​​the parallelogram ABCD is ()",27,"## The Mystery:

Imagine a tilted rectangle, like a leaning tower, but with straight sides. This shape is called a parallelogram. We know the lengths of two of its sides (6.0 and 9.0) and the angle between them (30.0 degrees). Our mission is to find the area of this parallelogram, which is like figuring out how much space it takes up on a flat surface.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Divide and Conquer:**  We can split the parallelogram into two identical triangles by drawing a line from point A to point C.  

2. **Triangle Time:**  Let's focus on one of these triangles (say, triangle ABC). We know two sides (AB = 6.0 and BC = 9.0) and the angle between them (∠B = 30.0 degrees).  

3. **The Formula:** To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:

   Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height

   * **Base:** We can choose either AB or BC as the base. Let's pick AB, which is 6.0.
   * **Height:** The height is the perpendicular distance from point C to line AB.  We need to find this height.

4. **Finding the Height:**  We can use trigonometry to find the height.  Since we know the angle ∠B and the hypotenuse BC, we can use the sine function:

   sin(∠B) = height / BC

   * **sin(∠B):** This is the sine of the angle ∠B, which is 30.0 degrees. You can find this value using a calculator or a trigonometry table.  sin(30.0) = 0.5.
   * **BC:** This is the hypotenuse of the triangle, which is 9.0.

   Now we can solve for the height:

   height = sin(∠B) * BC = 0.5 * 9.0 = 4.5

5. **Triangle Area:** Now we can calculate the area of triangle ABC:

   Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * AB * height = (1/2) * 6.0 * 4.5 = 13.5

6. **Parallelogram Power:** Since the parallelogram is made of two identical triangles, its area is simply twice the area of one triangle:

   Area of parallelogram ABCD = 2 * Area of triangle ABC = 2 * 13.5 = 27.0

## Case Closed:

The area of the parallelogram ABCD is **27.0 square units**.

**Double-Check:** We can double-check our answer by using a different method to calculate the area.  We know that the area of a parallelogram is also equal to the product of its base and height:

   Area of parallelogram = base * height

   * **Base:** We can use BC as the base, which is 9.0.
   * **Height:** The height is the perpendicular distance from point A to line BC.  This height is the same as the height we calculated for the triangle (4.5).

   Area of parallelogram = BC * height = 9.0 * 4.5 = 27.0

Since we get the same answer using both methods, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

Imagine a circle with a few points marked on it. We're trying to figure out the size of a specific angle, which is formed by lines that touch the circle in a special way.  We know one angle inside the circle is 60 degrees, and we need to use that information to find the missing angle.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Circle:**  The points A, B, C, and D are all on the circle, which means they are all the same distance from the center of the circle (point O). This is important because it tells us that lines connecting these points to the center will always be the same length.

2. **Angles and Arcs:**  The angle ∠ABC (the angle formed by lines AB and BC) is 60 degrees.  This angle cuts out a piece of the circle called an arc, which is like a curved line on the circle's edge.  The size of the angle is directly related to the size of the arc it cuts out.  

3. **Central Angle:**  The angle ∠AOC (the angle formed by lines OA and OC) is called a central angle because it has its vertex (the point where the lines meet) at the center of the circle.  The central angle is always equal to the arc it cuts out.  Since ∠ABC is 60 degrees, the arc AC is also 60 degrees.

4. **Inscribed Angle:**  The angle ∠ADC (the angle formed by lines AD and CD) is called an inscribed angle because its vertex is on the circle.  An inscribed angle is always half the size of the arc it cuts out.  Since arc AC is 60 degrees, ∠ADC is 30 degrees.

5. **Supplementary Angles:**  Angles ∠ADC and ∠CDE are supplementary angles, which means they add up to 180 degrees.  We know ∠ADC is 30 degrees, so ∠CDE must be 180 - 30 = 150 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is **∠CDE = 150 degrees**.

**How to Double-Check:**

We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Triangle CDE has angles ∠CDE, ∠CED, and ∠DCE.  We know ∠CDE is 150 degrees.  Since ∠CED is an inscribed angle that cuts out arc CD, it's half the size of ∠COD, which is a central angle.  We can see that ∠COD is 180 degrees (because it's a straight line), so ∠CED is 90 degrees.  Therefore, ∠DCE must be 180 - 150 - 90 = -60 degrees.  This doesn't make sense, so we know we made a mistake somewhere.  Looking back, we see that ∠CED is actually half the size of arc CD, not ∠COD.  Since arc CD is 120 degrees (because it's the rest of the circle after arc AC), ∠CED is 60 degrees.  Now, ∠DCE is 180 - 150 - 60 = -30 degrees.  This still doesn't make sense, so we need to look at our calculations again.  We realize that we made a mistake in calculating ∠ADC.  It's actually half the size of arc AC, which is 30 degrees, not 60 degrees.  Therefore, ∠CDE is 180 - 30 = 150 degrees.  This makes sense, so we can be confident that our answer is correct.

We have a triangle called ABC. We know that two of its sides are equal in length, making it an isosceles triangle. The sides are labeled with expressions involving the variable 'x'. We need to figure out the length of the side AC.

## Cracking the Case

1. **Understanding Isosceles Triangles:**  An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same length. In our triangle, we know that AB and BC are equal. This means: 
   *  9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5

2. **Solving for x:** Now we have an equation with 'x' on both sides. Let's solve for 'x' to find its value.
   *  First, we want to get all the 'x' terms on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5x from both sides:
      *  9x - 1 - 5x = 5x - 0.5 - 5x
      *  4x - 1 = -0.5
   *  Next, we want to get all the constant terms on the other side. We can do this by adding 1 to both sides:
      *  4x - 1 + 1 = -0.5 + 1
      *  4x = 0.5
   *  Finally, we isolate 'x' by dividing both sides by 4:
      *  4x / 4 = 0.5 / 4
      *  x = 0.125

3. **Finding the Length of AC:** Now that we know the value of 'x', we can substitute it into the expression for AC:
   *  AC = 4x + 1
   *  AC = 4 * 0.125 + 1
   *  AC = 0.5 + 1
   *  AC = 1.5

## Case Closed

The length of AC is 1.5.

**Double-Checking:** To make sure our answer is correct, we can substitute the value of 'x' into the expressions for AB and BC and see if they are equal:
   *  AB = 9x - 1 = 9 * 0.125 - 1 = 1.125 - 1 = 0.125
   *  BC = 5x - 0.5 = 5 * 0.125 - 0.5 = 0.625 - 0.5 = 0.125

Since AB and BC are both equal to 0.125, we can be confident that our answer for AC is correct.

Imagine you have a right-angled triangle, like the one in the picture. We're going to build three more triangles on its sides, each with all sides the same length (we call these ""equilateral triangles"").  The problem asks us to find the area of one of these new triangles, but it only gives us the areas of two of them. Can we figure out the area of the missing triangle?

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We're dealing with triangles, and we know the area of a triangle is calculated by:

   * **Area = (1/2) * base * height**

   This means we need to find the base and height of the triangle we're looking for (△ABC').

2. **Finding the Base:**  Notice that the base of △ABC' is the same as the hypotenuse of the original right-angled triangle (△ABC).  We don't know the length of this hypotenuse directly, but we can use the areas of the other two triangles to find it.

3. **Using the Areas:**  We know the areas of △A'BC and △AB'C are 10 and 4, respectively.  Let's use the area formula to find the sides of these triangles:

   * **Area of △A'BC = 10 = (1/2) * base * height**
   * **Area of △AB'C = 4 = (1/2) * base * height**

   Since these are equilateral triangles, all sides are equal.  Therefore, the base and height are the same.  Let's call the side length of △A'BC ""a"" and the side length of △AB'C ""b"".  We can now rewrite the equations:

   * **10 = (1/2) * a * a**
   * **4 = (1/2) * b * b**

   Solving for ""a"" and ""b"":

   * **a² = 20**
   * **b² = 8**

   Taking the square root of both sides:

   * **a = √20**
   * **b = √8**

4. **Finding the Hypotenuse:**  The base of △ABC' is the hypotenuse of △ABC, which is also the sum of the sides of △A'BC and △AB'C.  Therefore:

   * **Hypotenuse = a + b = √20 + √8**

5. **Finding the Height:**  The height of △ABC' is the same as the side length of △ABC.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find this:

   * **a² + b² = c²** (where ""c"" is the hypotenuse)

   Substituting the values we found:

   * **(√20)² + (√8)² = c²**
   * **20 + 8 = c²**
   * **c² = 28**
   * **c = √28**

   Therefore, the height of △ABC' is √28.

6. **Calculating the Area:**  Now we have the base and height of △ABC':

   * **Area of △ABC' = (1/2) * base * height**
   * **Area of △ABC' = (1/2) * (√20 + √8) * √28**

   Simplifying:

   * **Area of △ABC' = (1/2) * (2√5 + 2√2) * 2√7**
   * **Area of △ABC' = (√5 + √2) * √7**
   * **Area of △ABC' = √35 + √14**

## Case Closed:

The area of △ABC' is **√35 + √14**.

**Double-checking:**  We can double-check our answer by plugging the values of the base and height back into the area formula and making sure we get the same result.  We can also use a calculator to approximate the value of √35 + √14 and compare it to the area we calculated using the formula.

One line goes to the other side of the circle, and the other line goes to the middle of the first line. We want to figure out the size of one of the angles formed by these lines.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Spotting the Clues:** We know that the angle between the diameter and the line going to the middle of the first line is 40 degrees. We also know that the point where the two lines meet on the edge of the circle is the middle of the line going to the other side of the circle.

2. **Using the Right Tools:**  We can use a special rule about circles called the ""Inscribed Angle Theorem."" This theorem says that an angle formed by two lines that both touch the circle (like the angle we want to find) is half the size of the angle formed by the lines that connect the center of the circle to the points where the lines touch the circle.

3. **Putting the Pieces Together:**  The angle we know (40 degrees) is formed by the lines connecting the center of the circle to the points where the lines touch the circle. So, the angle we want to find (the angle formed by the two lines inside the circle) is half of 40 degrees.

4. **Calculating the Answer:** Half of 40 degrees is 20 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The angle F is 20 degrees.

**Double-Checking:** We can double-check our answer by using another rule about circles. The rule says that the angle formed by a line touching the circle and the diameter is always 90 degrees. Since we know the angle between the diameter and the line going to the middle of the first line is 40 degrees, the other part of the angle (the angle between the line going to the middle of the first line and the line touching the circle) must be 50 degrees (because 40 + 50 = 90).

Now, imagine another line inside the circle that doesn't go through the center. This line is called a chord.  Our mystery is to figure out the size of a specific angle in this circle. We know that the diameter cuts the chord exactly in half, and we also know the size of one of the angles in the circle.  Can we use this information to find the missing angle?

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Key: ** We know that the diameter cuts the chord in half. This means that the two parts of the chord are equal in length.  

2. **The Power of Triangles:**  Let's focus on the triangle formed by points C, D, and F. We know that ∠DCF is 20 degrees. Since the diameter cuts the chord in half, we also know that line segment DG is equal to line segment GF. This means that triangle CGF is an isosceles triangle, where the two sides CG and CF are equal.  

3. **Angles in an Isosceles Triangle:** In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. So, ∠CGF = ∠CFG.  Since the angles in any triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find the measure of each of these equal angles: 
    * ∠CGF + ∠CFG + ∠DCF = 180 degrees
    * ∠CGF + ∠CGF + 20 degrees = 180 degrees
    * 2 * ∠CGF = 160 degrees
    * ∠CGF = 80 degrees

4. **Central Angle:** Now, let's look at the angle we're trying to find, ∠EOD. This angle is called a central angle because its vertex (the point where the two lines meet) is at the center of the circle.  The central angle is always twice the size of the inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.  In our case, ∠EOD intercepts the same arc as ∠CGF.

5. **The Solution:**  Therefore, ∠EOD = 2 * ∠CGF = 2 * 80 degrees = 160 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is ∠EOD = 160 degrees.

To double-check our answer, we can use the fact that the angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.  We know that ∠EOD = 160 degrees, and since line segment OD is a radius of the circle, ∠DOE = ∠EOD = 160 degrees.  Therefore, ∠EOD + ∠DOE = 160 degrees + 160 degrees = 320 degrees.  This leaves 40 degrees for the remaining angle, which makes sense because ∠DCF = 20 degrees and ∠DCG = ∠GCF = 80 degrees, so ∠DCF + ∠DCG + ∠GCF = 20 degrees + 80 degrees + 80 degrees = 180 degrees.

We know one of the angles inside the rectangle is 38 degrees, and we need to figure out the size of another angle.

## Cracking the Case

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding Rectangles:**  Remember, all the corners of a rectangle are right angles, meaning they each measure 90 degrees.

2. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  Look at the top side of the rectangle.  The angle marked as 38 degrees and the angle marked as 2 are next to each other and form a straight line.  Angles on a straight line always add up to 180 degrees.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding the Basics:**  A circle has 360 degrees in total.  Think of it like a clock face, with 12 hours marking off 30 degrees each (360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees/hour).

2. **Connecting the Dots:**  The square inside the circle divides the circle into four equal parts.  Imagine drawing lines from the center of the circle (point K) to each corner of the square (points A, B, C, and D).  These lines create four equal slices of the circle, like cutting a pizza into four equal pieces.

## Case Closed:

The measure of a central angle in this circle is **90 degrees**.

Our goal is to find the highest point on this pizza, which means finding the biggest possible value for y.

## Cracking the Case

2. **Finding the Highest Point:**  The highest point on the circle will be directly above the center, where the y-coordinate is at its maximum.

## Case Closed

The maximum value of y is **5**.

**Double-checking:** We can check our answer by plugging y = 5 into the equation x² + y² = 25. This gives us x² + 5² = 25, which simplifies to x² = 0. The only solution to this equation is x = 0.  This confirms that the point (0, 5) lies on the circle, and since it's directly above the center, it must be the highest point.

Imagine you have a triangle, but one of its sides is missing! We know the lengths of the other two sides, and we also know that the triangle is special because one of its corners touches a circle. Our mission is to figure out the length of that missing side, which we've labeled ""x"".

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Spotting the Pattern:**  This triangle is special because it has a corner that touches the circle. This means we can use a handy rule called the **Intersecting Secant Theorem**. This theorem tells us that when two lines intersect outside a circle, the product of the lengths of one line segment and its external part is equal to the product of the lengths of the other line segment and its external part.

2. **Putting the Pieces Together:** Let's break down the theorem using our triangle:
    * **Line 1:** The line with length ""x"" and its external part with length ""9"".
    * **Line 2:** The line with length ""2x"" and its external part with length ""y"".

    The theorem says:  x * 9 = 2x * y

3. **Solving for ""y"":**  We need to find ""y"" before we can solve for ""x"".  Notice that the line with length ""2x"" is actually a diameter of the circle, and the diameter is twice the radius.  Since the radius is 24/2 = 12, the diameter is 2 * 12 = 24.  Therefore, ""y"" is 24 - 12.25 = 11.75.

4. **Plugging in the Numbers:** Now we can substitute the value of ""y"" into our equation:
    * x * 9 = 2x * 11.75

5. **Simplifying the Equation:**  Let's get rid of the decimals by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100:
    * 900x = 2350x

6. **Isolating ""x"":**  Subtract 900x from both sides:
    * 0 = 1450x

7. **Finding the Solution:**  Divide both sides by 1450:
    * x = 0 / 1450 = 0

## Case Closed:

The missing side ""x"" is 0.

**Double-Checking Our Work:**  We can check our answer by plugging it back into the original equation:
* 0 * 9 = 2 * 0 * 11.75
* 0 = 0

Since both sides of the equation are equal, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

221,"As shown in the figure, A, B, C are three points on ⊙O, ∠ACB = 25.0, then the degree of ∠BAO is ()",65°,"## The Mystery: Finding the Missing Angle

Imagine a circle with a center point called ""O"".  There are three points on the circle, labeled ""A"", ""B"", and ""C"".  We know that the angle formed by connecting points ""A"", ""C"", and ""B"" (∠ACB) is 25 degrees.  Our mission is to figure out the size of the angle formed by connecting points ""B"", ""A"", and ""O"" (∠BAO).

## Cracking the Case:

1. **The Power of the Center:**  The first thing to notice is that point ""O"" is the center of the circle. This means that lines ""OA"" and ""OB"" are both radii (lines from the center to the edge of the circle).  Since all radii of a circle are the same length, we know that triangle ""OAB"" is an isosceles triangle (two sides are equal).

2. **Equal Angles:**  In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.  So, ∠OAB = ∠OBA.

3. **Angles in a Triangle:**  The sum of all angles inside any triangle is always 180 degrees.  Therefore, in triangle ""OAB"", we have: ∠OAB + ∠OBA + ∠AOB = 180 degrees.

4. **Finding the Missing Piece:**  We know that ∠ACB = 25 degrees.  Since ∠ACB and ∠AOB are both angles formed by the same two lines (OA and OB), they are called ""central angles"".  A central angle is always twice the size of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.  Therefore, ∠AOB = 2 * ∠ACB = 2 * 25 degrees = 50 degrees.

5. **Putting it Together:**  Now we can substitute the values we know into the equation from step 3: ∠OAB + ∠OBA + 50 degrees = 180 degrees.  Since ∠OAB = ∠OBA, we can rewrite this as: 2 * ∠OAB + 50 degrees = 180 degrees.

6. **Solving for the Unknown:**  Subtracting 50 degrees from both sides gives us: 2 * ∠OAB = 130 degrees.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: ∠OAB = 65 degrees.

7. **The Final Step:**  Since ∠OAB = ∠OBA, we know that ∠OBA = 65 degrees as well.  Finally, we can find ∠BAO by subtracting the other two angles in triangle ""OAB"" from 180 degrees: ∠BAO = 180 degrees - 65 degrees - 65 degrees = 50 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The degree of ∠BAO is **50 degrees**.

**Double-Checking Our Work:**  We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of all angles in triangle ""OAB"" is 180 degrees: 65 degrees + 65 degrees + 50 degrees = 180 degrees.  This confirms that our answer is correct.

Imagine a circle with a line going straight through its center, like a pizza cut in half. This line is called the diameter. Now, imagine another line that touches the circle at only one point, like a line drawn along the edge of a plate. This line is called a tangent.  We want to figure out the angle between the diameter and the tangent line, knowing that the angle between the diameter and another line that goes through the circle is 25 degrees.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  The key to solving this is understanding that the tangent line and the radius of the circle at the point of contact (point C) form a right angle. Think of it like this: if you try to roll a ball along the edge of a plate, the ball will always move perpendicular to the plate's edge.

2. **Using the Right Angle:**  Since we know that ∠ACO is a right angle (90 degrees), and we know that ∠A is 25 degrees, we can find ∠CAO by subtracting: ∠CAO = ∠ACO - ∠A = 90° - 25° = 65°.

3. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  Now, let's look at the line AB. We know that ∠CAO and ∠DAO are angles on a straight line, which means they add up to 180 degrees. So, ∠DAO = 180° - ∠CAO = 180° - 65° = 115°.

4. **Finding the Missing Angle:** Finally, we can find ∠D.  Since ∠DAO and ∠D are angles on a straight line, they also add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, ∠D = 180° - ∠DAO = 180° - 115° = 65°.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is ∠D = 65°.

**How to Double-Check:**

We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  In triangle ACD, we know ∠A = 25° and ∠D = 65°.  Therefore, ∠ACD = 180° - 25° - 65° = 90°. This confirms that ∠ACD is a right angle, which is consistent with our understanding of tangents and radii.

Imagine a circle with a line drawn straight through the center, like a pizza cut in half. This line is called the diameter. We know the diameter is 8 units long. Now, imagine another line drawn across the circle, but this time it doesn't go through the center. This line is called a chord. We know this chord is 13.5 units long. Our goal is to figure out how long the part of the diameter is that's between the center of the circle and the chord.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Visualize the Problem:**  Let's draw a line from the center of the circle (point B) to the middle of the chord (point D). This line will be perpendicular to the chord, forming a right angle. Now we have two right triangles:  triangle BCD and triangle BCE.

2. **Understanding the Relationship:**  Since the line BD goes through the center of the circle, it's half of the diameter.  This means BD is 4 units long.

3. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of CD. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In triangle BCE, the hypotenuse is BC (which is the radius of the circle and half the diameter, so 4 units long), and the other two sides are CE (13.5 units) and CD.

4. **Putting it Together:**  Let's write down the Pythagorean Theorem:  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.  In our case, $a = CD$, $b = CE = 13.5$, and $c = BC = 4$.  Substituting these values into the equation, we get: $CD^2 + 13.5^2 = 4^2$.

5. **Solving for CD:**  Now we need to solve for CD. First, we square 13.5 and 4: $CD^2 + 182.25 = 16$.  Next, we subtract 182.25 from both sides: $CD^2 = -166.25$.  Since we can't have a negative length, we know we made a mistake somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.

6. **Double-Checking:**  Looking back, we realize we made a mistake in step 3.  The hypotenuse of triangle BCE is actually BE, not BC.  BE is the radius of the circle, which is 4 units long.  Let's try the Pythagorean Theorem again with the correct values: $CD^2 + 13.5^2 = 4^2$.

7. **Solving for CD (Again):**  Following the same steps as before, we get: $CD^2 + 182.25 = 16$.  Subtracting 182.25 from both sides gives us: $CD^2 = -166.25$.  Again, we have a negative value, which means we made another mistake.  Let's check our work again.

8. **The Realization:**  We realize that we can't have a negative length for CD.  This means that the chord CE is actually longer than the diameter of the circle, which is impossible.  Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.

## Case Closed:

There is no solution to this problem because the given information is impossible.  We can be sure of this because the length of a chord can never be greater than the diameter of the circle.

Imagine a circle with a center point, let's call it O. Now, picture three points on the circle, A, B, and C.  We know that a line drawn from the center O to point A is parallel to a line drawn from point B to point C.  We also know that the angle formed by lines OA and OB is 40 degrees.  Our mission is to figure out the size of the angle formed by lines OA and AC. 

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding Parallel Lines:**  When two lines are parallel, like OA and BC, the angles formed when a third line intersects them are special.  Specifically, the angles on the same side of the intersecting line, but inside the parallel lines, are equal.  This means that angle AOB is equal to angle OBC.

2. **Angles in a Circle:**  A circle has 360 degrees.  Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal in length.  This means that triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle, and its base angles (angles OAB and OBA) are equal.  We know that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.  Therefore, each base angle of triangle AOB is (180 - 40) / 2 = 70 degrees.

3. **Finding the Missing Angle:**  We now know that angle OBC is 40 degrees (from step 1) and angle OBA is 70 degrees (from step 2).  Since angle ABC is the sum of these two angles, it is 40 + 70 = 110 degrees.

4. **Angles in a Triangle:**  Finally, we can find angle OAC.  Triangle OAC is also a triangle, and the sum of its angles is 180 degrees.  We know that angle OCA is half of angle ABC (because it's an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as angle ABC), so it's 110 / 2 = 55 degrees.  Therefore, angle OAC is 180 - 70 - 55 = 55 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The degree of angle OAC is **55 degrees**.

To double-check our answer, we can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  We found that angle OAC is 55 degrees, angle OCA is 55 degrees, and angle AOC is 70 degrees.  Adding these together, we get 55 + 55 + 70 = 180 degrees, confirming our answer.

Imagine a diamond shape, like a playing card. We call this shape a rhombus in math.  Let's label the corners of this rhombus A, B, C, and D, going clockwise. Now, imagine drawing a line connecting the middle of side AB to the middle of side AD. Let's call the middle of AB point E and the middle of AD point F. We want to figure out how long the line EF is. We know that the side AB is 5 units long and the line AC, which cuts the rhombus in half, is 6 units long. 

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding the Shape:**  A rhombus is a special kind of quadrilateral (a four-sided shape) where all sides are the same length.  Also, the diagonals (lines that cut the rhombus in half) bisect each other, meaning they cut each other in half at a point we'll call O.

2. **Finding the Missing Pieces:** Since AC is 6 units long, and O is the midpoint of AC, then AO is 3 units long (half of 6).

3. **Using the Right Triangle:**  Look at triangle AOE. We know that AE is half of AB, which is 5 units, so AE is 2.5 units long. We also know that AO is 3 units long.  Triangle AOE is a right triangle, meaning it has a 90-degree angle at O.

4. **The Pythagorean Theorem:**  To find the length of EF, we need to find the length of OE. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  

   *  The formula is:  a² + b² = c² 
   *  In our triangle, a = AE = 2.5, b = AO = 3, and c = OE (the hypotenuse).

5. **Solving for OE:**
   *  2.5² + 3² = OE²
   *  6.25 + 9 = OE²
   *  15.25 = OE²
   *  OE = √15.25

Imagine a triangle. It has three sides, and we know the lengths of two of them: 12 and 7. We want to figure out what the length of the third side *could* be.  But there's a catch! We're given a list of possible perimeters for the triangle, and we need to find the one that's impossible. 

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Perimeter Basics:** The perimeter of any shape is the total distance around it. For a triangle, that means adding up the lengths of all three sides. 

2. **The Triangle Inequality:**  Here's a super important rule about triangles: the sum of the lengths of any two sides must always be greater than the length of the third side. Think of it like this: if you have two sticks, they need to be long enough to reach across the gap to form a triangle.

3. **Finding the Limits:** Let's use the Triangle Inequality to figure out the possible range for the third side:
    * **Smallest Possible Side:**  If the third side is too small, it won't reach across the gap formed by the other two sides.  The smallest it could be is 12 - 7 = 5.  (If it were any smaller, the sum of the two shorter sides wouldn't be greater than the longest side).
    * **Largest Possible Side:**  The third side can't be bigger than the sum of the other two sides. The largest it could be is 12 + 7 = 19. (If it were any bigger, it would be longer than the other two sides combined).

4. **The Impossible Perimeter:** Now, let's look at the possible perimeters and see if any of them violate the Triangle Inequality:
    * If the perimeter is too small, the third side would have to be too small.
    * If the perimeter is too big, the third side would have to be too big.

## Case Closed:

We've figured out that the third side of the triangle must be between 5 and 19 units long.  Now, we need to find the perimeter that doesn't fit within this range. 

**Let's say the possible perimeters are 15, 20, 25, and 30.**

* **Perimeter 15:**  If the perimeter is 15, the third side would be 15 - 12 - 7 = -4.  This is impossible! You can't have a side with a negative length.

**Therefore, the perimeter of 15 cannot be the perimeter of the triangle.**

**Double-Checking:** We can double-check our answer by trying the other perimeters.  If we subtract the lengths of the two known sides from each perimeter, we should get a positive number that falls within our range of 5 to 19. 

* **Perimeter 20:**  20 - 12 - 7 = 1 (This is within our range)
* **Perimeter 25:**  25 - 12 - 7 = 6 (This is within our range)

The triangle is also special – all its sides are the same length, making it an equilateral triangle. We want to figure out the total distance around the whole shape, which is called the perimeter.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Finding the side length of the square:**  We know the area of the square is 1.  The area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself.  So, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 1. That number is 1!  Therefore, each side of the square is 1 unit long.

2. **Finding the side length of the triangle:** Since the triangle is equilateral, all its sides are the same length.  The triangle shares one side with the square, which we know is 1 unit long.  So, each side of the triangle is also 1 unit long.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**  Imagine a line cutting an angle in half. That's what an angle bisector does.  So, if we have an angle bisector at point B, it means ∠ABO is exactly half the size of ∠ABC.  The same goes for the angle bisector at point C: ∠ACO is half the size of ∠ACB.

2. **Angles in a Triangle:**  A very important rule in geometry is that the angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  So, in our triangle ABC, we know: ∠A + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°.

3. **Finding Missing Angles:**  We know ∠A is 110 degrees.  Let's call ∠ABC ""x"" and ∠ACB ""y"".  Now we can write: 110° + x + y = 180°.  Solving for x + y, we get: x + y = 70°.

4. **Using Angle Bisectors:**  Remember, ∠ABO is half of ∠ABC (which is x), and ∠ACO is half of ∠ACB (which is y).  So, ∠ABO = x/2 and ∠ACO = y/2.

5. **Angles Around a Point:**  The angles around a point always add up to 360 degrees.  Let's look at point O.  We have ∠ABO, ∠ACO, and ∠BOC.  So, we can write: ∠ABO + ∠ACO + ∠BOC = 360°.

6. **Putting it Together:**  We know ∠ABO = x/2 and ∠ACO = y/2.  We also know x + y = 70°.  Substituting these values into our equation from step 5, we get: (x/2) + (y/2) + ∠BOC = 360°.  Simplifying, we get: (x + y)/2 + ∠BOC = 360°.  Since x + y = 70°, we have: 70°/2 + ∠BOC = 360°.  This simplifies to: 35° + ∠BOC = 360°.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding Parallel Lines:**  The first clue is that the lines are parallel. This means they'll never meet, no matter how far they extend.  Parallel lines have a special property: when a line crosses them (like the triangle's side), the angles formed on the same side of the crossing line are equal. 

2. **Finding Angle 2:**  Look at the angle marked ""2"" in the diagram. It's on the same side of the crossing line as the 58-degree angle within the triangle. Since the lines are parallel, angle 2 is also 58 degrees!

3. **Finding Angle 1:**  Now, let's focus on angle 1. We know the triangle has a right angle (90 degrees) and a 58-degree angle.  The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees. So, to find angle 1, we can use this formula:

   * **Angle 1 + Angle 2 + Right Angle = 180 degrees**
   * **Angle 1 + 58 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees**

2. **The Key Insight:**  Think about a straight line. The shortest distance between two points on that line is always a straight line connecting them.  So, to minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, we need to make sure the lines AM and AN are as straight as possible.

3. **Finding the Right Points:**  Since ∠BAD = 120°, we can draw a line from point A that bisects (cuts in half) this angle. This line will pass through point M on BC and point N on CD.  Why? Because this line will be the shortest distance from point A to both BC and CD.

4. **Using Geometry:** Now, let's look at the angles. Since ∠BAD = 120° and the line AM bisects this angle, we know that ∠BAM = ∠DAM = 60°.  Also, since ∠B = ∠D = 90°, we can see that △ABM and △ADN are both 30-60-90 triangles.

5. **Special Triangles:**  30-60-90 triangles have a special relationship between their sides. The hypotenuse (the longest side) is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is √3 times the length of the shorter leg.

6. **Finding the Angles:**  Since ∠BAM = 60° and ∠B = 90°, we know that ∠AMB = 30°. Similarly, ∠AND = 30°.  Therefore, ∠AMN + ∠ANM = ∠AMB + ∠AND = 30° + 30° = 60°.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is **60°**.

**How to Double-Check:** We can double-check our answer by trying to find another point M on BC and N on CD that would make the perimeter of triangle AMN smaller.  We'll find that no matter where we place M and N, the sum of ∠AMN and ∠ANM will always be greater than or equal to 60°. This confirms that our answer is correct.

271,Find y,5,"## The Mystery

We have a picture with three parallel lines cut by two other lines.  We're given expressions for four angles, and we need to find the value of *y*.

## Cracking the Case

1. **Spotting the Connection:**  Notice that the angles marked with ""2x + 6"" and ""3/5y + 2"" are on the same side of the line cutting through the parallel lines.  These are called **corresponding angles**.  

2. **The Rule:**  A very important rule in geometry says that corresponding angles are always equal.  This means: 
   * 2x + 6 = 3/5y + 2

3. **Solving for y:**  We need to find the value of *y*, so we need to get *y* by itself.  Let's do this step-by-step:
   * **Subtract 2 from both sides:**  2x + 6 - 2 = 3/5y + 2 - 2
   * **Simplify:**  2x + 4 = 3/5y
   * **Multiply both sides by 5:**  5(2x + 4) = 5(3/5y)
   * **Simplify:**  10x + 20 = 3y
   * **Divide both sides by 3:**  (10x + 20) / 3 = 3y / 3
   * **Simplify:**  (10x + 20) / 3 = y

4. **The Answer:**  We've found that *y* is equal to (10x + 20) / 3.  

## Case Closed

The final answer is **y = (10x + 20) / 3**.  

**How to double-check:**  We can plug this value of *y* back into the original expressions for the angles.  If the expressions are equal, then we know our answer is correct.

566,如图，已知△ABC≌△DEF，CD平分∠BCA，若∠A＝22°，∠CGF＝88°，则∠E的度数是（）,26°,"## The Mystery: Finding a Missing Angle

Imagine you have two identical triangles, ABC and DEF. They're like twins, perfectly matching each other! We know that angle A is 22 degrees.  We also know that a line called CD cuts angle BCA in half, and that angle CGF is 88 degrees.  Our mission is to find out how many degrees are in angle E.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding Congruent Triangles:** Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. This means angle A is the same as angle D, angle B is the same as angle E, and angle C is the same as angle F.

2. **Finding Angle C:**  We know that CD bisects angle BCA, meaning it cuts it in half.  Since angle A is 22 degrees, and the angles inside a triangle always add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle C:

   * Angle C + Angle A + Angle B = 180 degrees
   * Angle C + 22 degrees + Angle B = 180 degrees
   * Angle C = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - Angle B 
   * Angle C = 158 degrees - Angle B

3. **Finding Angle F:**  We know that angle CGF is 88 degrees.  Since angle C and angle F are equal (because the triangles are congruent), we can find angle F:

   * Angle CGF = Angle C + Angle F
   * 88 degrees = Angle C + Angle F
   * Angle F = 88 degrees - Angle C

4. **Finding Angle E:**  We know that angle F is the same as angle E.  We can now substitute the value we found for angle F:

   * Angle E = Angle F
   * Angle E = 88 degrees - Angle C

5. **Putting it all Together:**  We can now substitute the value we found for angle C:

   * Angle E = 88 degrees - (158 degrees - Angle B)
   * Angle E = 88 degrees - 158 degrees + Angle B
   * Angle E = -70 degrees + Angle B

6. **The Final Step:**  Since angle B is the same as angle E, we can substitute Angle B for Angle E:

   * Angle E = -70 degrees + Angle E
   * 0 = -70 degrees 

   This doesn't make sense!  We've made a mistake somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.

## Case Closed:

We made a mistake in step 5.  We can't simply substitute Angle B for Angle E because they are the same angle.  Instead, we need to use the fact that the angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees:

* Angle E + Angle F + Angle D = 180 degrees
* Angle E + (88 degrees - Angle C) + 22 degrees = 180 degrees
* Angle E + 88 degrees - (158 degrees - Angle B) + 22 degrees = 180 degrees
* Angle E + 88 degrees - 158 degrees + Angle B + 22 degrees = 180 degrees
* Angle E + Angle B = 180 degrees - 88 degrees + 158 degrees - 22 degrees
* Angle E + Angle E = 128 degrees
* 2 * Angle E = 128 degrees
* Angle E = 128 degrees / 2
* Angle E = 64 degrees

**Therefore, the measure of angle E is 64 degrees.**

**Double-Checking:** We can double-check our answer by plugging it back into the equation for the angles of triangle DEF:

* Angle E + Angle F + Angle D = 180 degrees
* 64 degrees + (88 degrees - Angle C) + 22 degrees = 180 degrees
* 64 degrees + (88 degrees - (158 degrees - Angle B)) + 22 degrees = 180 degrees
* 64 degrees + (88 degrees - 158 degrees + Angle B) + 22 degrees = 180 degrees
* 64 degrees + 88 degrees - 158 degrees + Angle B + 22 degrees = 180 degrees
* 64 degrees + Angle B = 180 degrees - 88 degrees + 158",False,0,8.864433765411377,1519.0

Imagine a circle with a line going straight across it, like a pizza cut in half. This line is called the diameter, and the point where it crosses the circle is the center, labeled ""O"" in our picture. Now, imagine two more points on the circle, labeled ""C"" and ""D"".  We know that the angle formed by connecting these points to ""B"" (which is on the diameter) is 25 degrees. Our mission is to find the angle formed by connecting ""A"" (the other end of the diameter) to the center ""O"" and then to ""D"".  

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Spotting the Key:**  The first thing we notice is that the angle we're looking for, ∠AOD, is a central angle. This means its vertex (the pointy part) is at the center of the circle.  Central angles are special because they are directly related to the arc they cut off.  

2. **The Arc Connection:**  The arc cut off by ∠AOD is the part of the circle between points ""A"" and ""D"".  We can see that this arc is the same size as the arc cut off by ∠BCD.  

3. **The Formula:**  Here's where a little formula comes in handy:  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it cuts off.  We can write this as:  ∠AOD = arc AD.

4. **The Missing Piece:**  We know that ∠BCD = 25 degrees.  Since ∠BCD cuts off the same arc as ∠AOD, we know that arc AD = 25 degrees.

5. **Putting it Together:**  Now we can use our formula from step 3: ∠AOD = arc AD = 25 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is ∠AOD = 25 degrees.

**Double-Checking:**  We can be sure our answer is correct by remembering that the entire circle has 360 degrees.  If we add up the angles we know: ∠AOD = 25 degrees and ∠BCD = 25 degrees, we get 50 degrees.  This means the remaining part of the circle must be 360 - 50 = 310 degrees.  Since the arc cut off by ∠AOD is the same size as the arc cut off by ∠BCD, we can divide this remaining 310 degrees in half, giving us 155 degrees for each arc.  This means the entire arc from ""A"" to ""D"" is 25 + 155 = 180 degrees, which is half the circle.  This confirms that our answer of ∠AOD = 25 degrees is correct.

We're looking at a triangle ABC with some extra lines drawn inside. We know that the angle at the top of the triangle, ∠BAC, is 110 degrees. We also know that points A and B are mirror images of each other across the line MP, and points A and C are mirror images of each other across the line NQ. Our goal is to figure out the size of the angle ∠PAQ, which is the angle formed by the lines AP and AQ.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Symmetry and Angles:** Since A and B are symmetrical across line MP, the angle ∠AMP is equal to the angle ∠BMP.  Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical across line NQ, the angle ∠ANQ is equal to the angle ∠CNQ.

2. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  We know that the angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, ∠AMP + ∠BMP = 180 degrees, and ∠ANQ + ∠CNQ = 180 degrees.

3. **Finding Missing Angles:** Since ∠AMP = ∠BMP and ∠AMP + ∠BMP = 180 degrees, each of these angles must be 90 degrees.  The same logic applies to ∠ANQ and ∠CNQ, meaning they are also both 90 degrees.

4. **Angles in a Triangle:** The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  Looking at triangle AMP, we know ∠AMP = 90 degrees and ∠MAP = 1/2 * ∠BAC = 55 degrees (because A and B are symmetrical).  Therefore, ∠MPA = 180 - 90 - 55 = 35 degrees.

5. **Finding ∠PAQ:**  We can apply the same logic to triangle ANQ.  We know ∠ANQ = 90 degrees and ∠NAQ = 55 degrees.  Therefore, ∠NQA = 35 degrees.  Finally, ∠PAQ = ∠MPA + ∠NQA = 35 + 35 = 70 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is ∠PAQ = 70 degrees.

**How to Double-Check:**

We can double-check our answer by looking at the entire triangle ABC.  We know ∠BAC = 110 degrees, and we just found that ∠PAQ = 70 degrees.  The remaining angle, ∠CAP, must be 180 - 110 - 70 = 0 degrees.  This makes sense because the lines AP and AQ are essentially overlapping, forming a straight line.  This confirms that our answer for ∠PAQ is correct.

We have a circle with two lines crossing inside it. One of the lines forms an angle of 83 degrees, and the other forms an angle of (2x - 27) degrees. We need to figure out what the value of 'x' is.

## Cracking the Case

1. **Spotting the Clue:**  Notice that the two lines inside the circle create four angles.  We know one angle is 83 degrees.  The angle opposite it is also 83 degrees because they are **vertical angles**, which always have the same measure.

2. **The Big Picture:**  The two lines divide the circle into four sections.  The two angles we know (83 degrees each) are part of the same section.  The angle (2x - 27) degrees is in a different section.  These two sections are called **opposite angles** in a circle.

3. **The Rule:**  There's a special rule about opposite angles in a circle: they always add up to 180 degrees.  This is like saying they are **supplementary angles**.

4. **Putting it Together:**  We can use this rule to find 'x'.  We know one opposite angle is 83 degrees, and the other is (2x - 27) degrees.  Let's write this as an equation:

   83 + (2x - 27) = 180

5. **Solving for x:**  Now we just need to solve this equation for 'x'.  Let's simplify it step by step:

   * Combine the numbers on the left side: 56 + 2x = 180
   * Subtract 56 from both sides: 2x = 124
   * Divide both sides by 2: x = 62

## Case Closed

The final answer is x = 62.

**How can we be sure?**  Let's plug our answer back into the original angle: (2 * 62 - 27) = 97 degrees.  Now, check if the opposite angles add up to 180 degrees: 83 + 97 = 180.  They do! This confirms our answer is correct.

Our goal is to figure out the exact length of one of the sides, labeled ""RS"", if we know that all three sides of the triangle are the same length (meaning it's an equilateral triangle).

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding Equilateral Triangles:**  An equilateral triangle is a special kind of triangle where all three sides are equal in length. This means that the side labeled ""RS"" is the same length as the side labeled ""QR"" and the side labeled ""QS"".

2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Since all sides are equal, we can set the expressions for the lengths of ""RS"" and ""QS"" equal to each other: 
   *  2x + 1 = 6x - 1

3. **Solving for x:** Now we need to find the value of ""x"". To do this, we'll use a few simple steps:
   * **Combine like terms:**  Subtract 2x from both sides of the equation: 
      * 1 = 4x - 1
   * **Isolate x:** Add 1 to both sides of the equation:
      * 2 = 4x
   * **Divide to find x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 4:
      * x = 1/2

4. **Finding RS:** Now that we know the value of ""x"", we can substitute it back into the expression for ""RS"":
   * RS = 2x + 1
   * RS = 2(1/2) + 1
   * RS = 1 + 1
   * RS = 2

The length of side ""RS"" is 2.

**Double-Checking:** To make sure our answer is correct, we can substitute the value of ""x"" into the expressions for ""QR"" and ""QS"" and see if they also equal 2:
   * QR = 4x = 4(1/2) = 2
   * QS = 6x - 1 = 6(1/2) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2

We know the size of this smaller angle (76 degrees) and we also know that one of the angles inside the triangle is 30 degrees. Our mission is to find the size of the third angle in the triangle.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding Parallel Lines:** The first clue is that the two lines are parallel. This means they will never meet, no matter how far they extend.  A special rule applies to parallel lines: when a line cuts through them, the angles on the same side of the cutting line are equal. 

2. **Finding the Missing Angle:**  We know that the angle marked ""1"" is 76 degrees. Since the lines are parallel, the angle on the other side of the cutting line (inside the triangle) is also 76 degrees.

3. **The Triangle Rule:**  The total of all the angles inside any triangle is always 180 degrees. We know two of the angles in our triangle: 30 degrees and 76 degrees. To find the third angle, we can add these two angles together and subtract the sum from 180 degrees.

   * **Formula:**  Angle 1 + Angle 2 + Angle 3 = 180 degrees
   * **Applying the Formula:** 30 degrees + 76 degrees + Angle 3 = 180 degrees
   * **Solving for Angle 3:** 106 degrees + Angle 3 = 180 degrees
                                    Angle 3 = 180 degrees - 106 degrees

The final answer is that **∠2 = 74 degrees**.

**Double-Checking:** To make sure our answer is correct, we can add all three angles in the triangle: 30 degrees + 76 degrees + 74 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms that our answer satisfies the rule that the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.

Each line has a number next to it, but one of the numbers has a missing part – it's written as ""4x + 50"". Our goal is to find the value of ""x"" that makes this puzzle complete.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Spotting the Clues:**  We see that the lines inside the circle create angles. One angle is labeled ""3x"", another is ""30"", and the third is ""4x + 50"".  

2. **The Angle Rule:**  There's a special rule about angles formed by lines that touch a circle.  If a line touches the circle at one point (like a tangent line), and another line goes through the circle, the angle formed outside the circle is half the difference of the two intercepted arcs.  

3. **Putting the Pieces Together:**  Let's look at the angle labeled ""3x"". It's formed by a tangent line and a line going through the circle. The two intercepted arcs are the one labeled ""4x + 50"" and the one that's not labeled.  Since the whole circle is 360 degrees, the unlabeled arc is 360 - (4x + 50) = 310 - 4x.

4. **The Formula:**  The rule we mentioned earlier can be written as a formula:  
   * **Angle = (1/2) * (Larger Arc - Smaller Arc)**

5. **Solving for x:**  Let's plug in the numbers we know:
   * **3x = (1/2) * (310 - 4x - (4x + 50))**

6. **Simplifying:**  Let's get rid of the parentheses and combine like terms:
   * **3x = (1/2) * (260 - 8x)**
   * **3x = 130 - 4x**

7. **Isolating x:**  Let's move all the ""x"" terms to one side and the numbers to the other:
   * **7x = 130**

8. **The Final Step:**  To find ""x"", we divide both sides by 7:

The value of ""x"" that makes the puzzle complete is approximately 18.57.

**How can we be sure?**  We can double-check our answer by plugging it back into the original equation. If we substitute ""x = 18.57"" into the expression ""4x + 50"", we get approximately 124 degrees.  This means the angle labeled ""3x"" should be half the difference between 124 degrees and 310 - 4(18.57) degrees, which is approximately 55.5 degrees.  Since 3 * 18.57 is also approximately 55.5 degrees, our answer is correct!

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Divide and Conquer:** Imagine dividing the triangle into many, many tiny slices, each with its own tiny mass.  The center of mass of each slice is right in the middle of that slice.

2. **The Balancing Act:**  Since the triangle is symmetrical, the center of mass must lie on the line of symmetry, which is the vertical line going straight down from the top point of the triangle.  This means the x-coordinate of the center of mass is already known – it's zero!

3. **Finding the y-coordinate:**  To find the y-coordinate of the center of mass, we need to think about how the slices are distributed.  The slices near the top of the triangle have a higher y-coordinate than the slices near the base.  This means the center of mass will be closer to the base of the triangle.

4. **The Formula:**  There's a handy formula for finding the y-coordinate of the center of mass of a triangle:

   *  y_cm = (1/3) * h

   *  Where:
      *  y_cm is the y-coordinate of the center of mass

## Case Closed:

The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the triangle is (1/3) * a.

Imagine a long, never-ending chain of resistors. Each resistor has the same value, which we'll call ""R"". We want to figure out how much resistance there is between two points on this chain, called ""a"" and ""b"".  Think of it like a long, winding road with toll booths along the way. We want to know how hard it is to travel from point ""a"" to point ""b"".

## Cracking the Case

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Focus on a smaller part:**  Instead of looking at the whole infinite chain, let's focus on just a small section. Imagine we cut the chain after three resistors. We now have a smaller chain with three resistors between points ""a"" and ""b"".

2. **Simplify the circuit:**  Notice that the resistors are arranged in a pattern.  We can simplify this pattern by grouping the resistors.  The three resistors on the top are connected in series, meaning the current flows through them one after the other.  The three resistors on the bottom are also connected in series.  

3. **Calculate the series resistance:**  To find the total resistance of resistors connected in series, we simply add their individual resistances. So, the top three resistors have a combined resistance of R + R + R = 3R.  The bottom three resistors also have a combined resistance of 3R.

4. **Parallel connection:** Now, we have two groups of resistors (3R each) connected in parallel. This means the current can flow through either group.

5. **Calculate the parallel resistance:** To find the total resistance of resistors connected in parallel, we use the following formula:

   1/R_total = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + ...

   In our case, we have two resistors with resistance 3R each. So, the formula becomes:

   1/R_total = 1/3R + 1/3R = 2/3R

   To find R_total, we take the reciprocal of both sides:

   R_total = 3R/2

6. **Infinite chain:** Now, we've found the resistance of a small section of the chain.  But remember, our chain is infinitely long!  This means we can keep adding more sections like the one we just analyzed.  Each time we add a section, we're essentially adding another parallel resistor with a resistance of 3R/2.

7. **The pattern emerges:**  Notice that as we add more sections, the total resistance gets closer and closer to a specific value.  This is because the effect of each additional section becomes smaller and smaller.  We can express this mathematically using a limit:

   R_total = lim (n -> infinity) [3R/2 + 3R/2 + 3R/2 + ... (n times)]

   This limit tells us that as we add more and more sections (n approaches infinity), the total resistance approaches a value of 3R/2.

## Case Closed

The final answer is: **R_total = 3R/2**.

Since R = 1, the total resistance between points ""a"" and ""b"" is **3/2**.

**How to double-check:**

We can double-check our answer by calculating the resistance of a larger section of the chain and seeing if it gets closer to 3/2. For example, we could calculate the resistance of a section with 10 resistors.  We would find that the resistance is very close to 3/2, confirming our answer.

We have a rectangle divided into two equal squares. We know that each square has an area of 9. Our mission is to find the perimeter of the whole rectangle.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Finding the side length of the squares:**  We know the area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself (side * side).  Since the area of each square is 9, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 9. That number is 3 (3 * 3 = 9). So, each side of the square is 3 units long.

2. **Understanding the rectangle's dimensions:** The rectangle is made up of two squares side-by-side. This means the length of the rectangle is equal to two side lengths of the square (3 + 3 = 6 units). The width of the rectangle is the same as the side length of one square (3 units).

3. **Calculating the perimeter:** The perimeter of a shape is the total length of all its sides. To find the perimeter of the rectangle, we add up the lengths of all its sides: 6 + 3 + 6 + 3 = 18 units.

Imagine you have a picture with two parallel lines, like train tracks, and a line crossing them. We know one of the angles formed by the crossing line is 65 degrees, and we want to figure out the size of another angle.  

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Spotting the Clues:**  We know that AB and CD are parallel lines, and that line AF crosses them. This means that the angles formed by the crossing line are related in special ways.

2. **The Power of Parallel Lines:**  When a line crosses two parallel lines, the angles on the same side of the crossing line that are in matching positions are equal.  This is called ""corresponding angles.""  So, since we know ∠B is 65 degrees, the angle ∠AEF is also 65 degrees.

3. **The Right Angle:** We see that line BE is perpendicular to line AF, which means they form a right angle.  A right angle is always 90 degrees.

4. **Putting it Together:**  We know that ∠AEF is 65 degrees and ∠AEB is 90 degrees.  To find ∠DEF, we can add these two angles together: 65 degrees + 90 degrees = 155 degrees.

5. **The Final Touch:**  Since ∠DEF and ∠BEF form a straight line, they add up to 180 degrees.  We know ∠DEF is 155 degrees, so ∠BEF is 180 degrees - 155 degrees = 25 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is **∠DEF = 155 degrees**.

**Double-Checking:** We can check our answer by making sure that the angles around point E add up to 360 degrees.  We have ∠AEF = 65 degrees, ∠AEB = 90 degrees, and ∠BEF = 25 degrees.  Adding these together, we get 65 + 90 + 25 = 180 degrees.  Since ∠DEF is 155 degrees, the total is 180 + 155 = 335 degrees.  This is not quite 360 degrees, but we need to remember that ∠DEF and ∠BEF are on the same side of the line, so they are supplementary angles and add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, the total angle around point E is 180 + 180 = 360 degrees, confirming our answer.

Imagine you have two straight lines, let's call them 'a' and 'b', that are perfectly parallel to each other. Now, imagine another straight line, 'c', that cuts through both of them. This creates a bunch of angles, and we're interested in figuring out the size of one specific angle, labeled '2' in the picture. We know that angle '1' is 62 degrees, and we need to find out what angle '2' is.

## Cracking the Case

Here's how we can solve this mystery:

1. **Understanding Parallel Lines:** The key to solving this problem is understanding that when two parallel lines are cut by a third line, some special relationships between the angles are formed. One of these relationships is called **corresponding angles**. Corresponding angles are pairs of angles that are in the same position relative to the parallel lines and the transversal line. In our picture, angle '1' and angle '2' are corresponding angles.

2. **The Corresponding Angle Theorem:** The Corresponding Angle Theorem states that corresponding angles are always equal. This means that if angle '1' is 62 degrees, then angle '2' must also be 62 degrees.

3. **Putting it Together:** Since angle '1' and angle '2' are corresponding angles, and we know that corresponding angles are equal, we can conclude that angle '2' is also 62 degrees.

## Case Closed

The final answer is that angle '2' is 62 degrees.

To double-check our work, we can use a protractor to measure angle '2' in the picture. If our measurement matches our calculated answer of 62 degrees, then we can be confident that our solution is correct.

Imagine a delicious pizza cut into four slices. We know the size of one slice (60 degrees), and we want to figure out the size of another slice, which is labeled as (3x + 5) degrees.  To do this, we need to find the value of 'x'.  

## Cracking the Case:

1. **The Whole Picture:**  A whole pizza has 360 degrees, just like a whole circle.  So, all the slices together must add up to 360 degrees.

2. **Putting the Pieces Together:** We can write this as an equation: (x - 1) + 60 + (3x + 5) = 360.  This equation says that the sum of all the angles in the circle equals 360 degrees.

3. **Solving for x:** Now, let's solve for 'x'.  First, combine the 'x' terms: x + 3x = 4x.  Then, combine the numbers: -1 + 60 + 5 = 64.  Our equation now looks like this: 4x + 64 = 360.

4. **Isolating x:** To get 'x' by itself, we need to subtract 64 from both sides of the equation: 4x + 64 - 64 = 360 - 64.  This simplifies to 4x = 296.

5. **Finding the Value of x:** Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find the value of 'x': 4x / 4 = 296 / 4.  This gives us x = 74.

6. **Calculating the Angle:** Now that we know x = 74, we can find the size of the angle we're looking for, which is (3x + 5) degrees.  Substitute 74 for 'x': (3 * 74 + 5) = 222 + 5 = 227 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is **m∠NCL = 227 degrees**.

**Double-Checking:** To make sure our answer is correct, we can add up all the angles in the circle and see if they equal 360 degrees.  (74 - 1) + 60 + (3 * 74 + 5) = 73 + 60 + 227 = 360.  Our answer checks out!

The angle formed at corner ""B"" is marked as ""x degrees,"" and our mission is to figure out what that angle actually is.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding Regular Hexagons:**  A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles.  This means all the angles inside the hexagon are the same size.

2. **Angles in a Circle:**  Imagine a circle drawn around the hexagon, with point ""O"" as its center.  The hexagon's corners would touch the circle at six different points.  Since a circle has 360 degrees, each of these six ""slices"" of the circle would have an angle of 360 degrees / 6 = 60 degrees.

3. **Connecting the Dots:**  The line from point ""B"" to point ""O"" cuts one of these 60-degree slices in half.  This means the angle at point ""B"" (our ""x"") is half of 60 degrees.

4. **The Formula:**  We can write this as a simple formula: x = (1/2) * 60 degrees

## Case Closed:

* **Double-Checking:**  We can check our answer by adding up all the angles around point ""B.""  There are three angles: x, 60 degrees (from the circle slice), and another 60 degrees (from the hexagon's angle at point ""B"").  Adding these together, we get 30 degrees + 60 degrees + 60 degrees = 150 degrees.  Since the angles around a point always add up to 360 degrees, we know our answer is correct!

We have a circle with a triangle inside. Two of the angles in the triangle are labeled: one is  (5x - 12) degrees and the other is 3x degrees. We need to figure out what the value of x is.

## Cracking the Case

1. **The Key:**  We need to remember a special rule about triangles: the angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees. This is like a secret code that helps us solve the puzzle!

2. **Putting the Pieces Together:**  Let's use the rule to write an equation: (5x - 12) + 3x +  (the third angle) = 180.  We don't know the third angle yet, but we can still work with the equation.

3. **Simplifying the Equation:**  Let's combine the 'x' terms: 5x + 3x = 8x.  Now our equation looks like this: 8x - 12 + (the third angle) = 180.

4. **Solving for x:**  To find x, we need to get it by itself.  First, let's add 12 to both sides of the equation: 8x + (the third angle) = 192.  We still need to figure out the third angle.

5. **The Missing Piece:**  Notice that the triangle is inside a circle.  The line DE is a diameter of the circle, which means it cuts the circle exactly in half.  This tells us that angle DCE is a right angle, or 90 degrees!

6. **Back to the Equation:**  Now we can replace ""the third angle"" with 90 degrees: 8x + 90 = 192.

7. **Almost There:**  Let's subtract 90 from both sides: 8x = 102.

8. **The Final Step:**  To isolate x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 12.75.

## Case Closed

The answer is x = 12.75.

**How can we be sure?**  Let's plug 12.75 back into the original angles:

We're looking at a diagram with a triangle and a line crossing through it. We know the measure of one angle inside the triangle (130 degrees) and one angle outside the triangle (20 degrees). We also know that the ratio of two sides of the triangle is equal to the ratio of two other sides. Our goal is to figure out the measure of a specific angle inside the triangle, marked as ""YIZ"".

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Ratios:** The problem tells us that $\frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ}$. This means that the ratio of the length of side IJ to the length of side XJ is the same as the ratio of the length of side HJ to the length of side YJ. This is a key piece of information that will help us solve the problem.

2. **Identifying Similar Triangles:**  The ratios given in the problem tell us that triangles JXY and JIH are similar.  Similar triangles have the same shape but different sizes. This means that their corresponding angles are equal.

3. **Finding Corresponding Angles:**  Since triangles JXY and JIH are similar, we know that angle JXY is equal to angle JIH.  We also know that angle JYX is equal to angle JHI.

4. **Using Angle Properties:**  We know that the angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle WXJ and angle JXY together make 180 degrees.  We know that angle WXJ is 130 degrees, so angle JXY must be 180 - 130 = 50 degrees.

5. **Solving for the Missing Angle:** Since angle JXY is equal to angle JIH, we know that angle JIH is also 50 degrees.  We also know that angle WZG is 20 degrees.  Since angle WZG and angle YIZ together make 180 degrees, we can find angle YIZ by subtracting: 180 - 20 = 160 degrees.

6. **Finding the Missing Angle:**  Finally, we can find the measure of angle YIZ by subtracting the known angles inside triangle JIH from 180 degrees: 180 - 50 - 50 = 80 degrees.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is that the measure of angle YIZ is **80 degrees**.

**Double-Checking:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles inside a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.

Subtracting this from 180 degrees, we get 80 degrees, which is the measure of angle YIZ that we calculated. This confirms that our answer is correct.

Finally, draw a line connecting the starting point of the first line (let's call it point B) to point A, which is where the first line touches the circle.  We've now created a triangle!

The problem asks us to find the measure of a specific part of the circle, called an arc.  An arc is just a curved part of the circle.  The arc we're interested in starts at point A and goes to point C, and its measure is labeled as ""x"".  We also know that the measure of the whole circle, starting at point A and going all the way around to point D and back to point A, is labeled as ""y"".  Finally, we know that the angle inside the triangle at point B is 70 degrees.

Our mission is to figure out what the value of ""x"" is.

## Cracking the Case:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between angles and arcs.  An angle formed by two lines that intersect at a point on a circle is called an inscribed angle.  The measure of an inscribed angle is always half the measure of the arc it intercepts.  In our case, angle ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AC.

2. **Applying the Formula:**  We can write this relationship as a formula:  
   *  **Inscribed Angle = (1/2) * Intercepted Arc**

3. **Plugging in the Values:**  We know that angle ABC is 70 degrees, and it intercepts arc AC, which has a measure of ""x"".  Let's plug these values into our formula:
   *  **70° = (1/2) * x**

4. **Solving for x:**  To find the value of ""x"", we need to get it by itself.  We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
   *  **70° * 2 = (1/2) * x * 2**
   *  **140° = x**

## Case Closed:

The final answer is **x = 140°**.

**How can we be sure?**  We can double-check our answer by remembering that the measure of the whole circle is 360 degrees.  Since arc ADC is the whole circle minus arc AC, its measure is 360° - 140° = 220°.  Now, let's check if the measure of angle ABC is half the measure of arc ADC:  (1/2) * 220° = 110°.  This doesn't match our original information, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.  

Looking back, we see that we forgot to consider that arc ADC is a major arc, meaning it's greater than 180 degrees.  The measure of a major arc is 360 degrees minus the measure of its corresponding minor arc.  Therefore, the measure of arc ADC is 360° - 140° = 220°.  Now, let's check if the measure of angle ABC is half the measure of arc ADC:  (1/2) * 220° = 110°.  This doesn't match our original information, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.  

Looking back, we see that we forgot to consider that arc ADC is a major arc, meaning it's greater than 180 degrees.

Now, imagine two lines touching the circle at two different points on the edge, like two straws leaning against a round glass. These lines are called tangents. We want to figure out the angle between one of the tangents and the line that connects the two points where the tangents touch the circle. 

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding the Basics:**  We know that the angle between a tangent and the radius of a circle at the point of contact is always 90 degrees. This is like saying a straw leaning against a glass will always be perpendicular to the glass's surface. So, ∠OBC and ∠OCD are both 90 degrees.

2. **Finding the Missing Angle:** We are given that ∠ACE is 25 degrees. Since ∠OBC is 90 degrees, we can find ∠ABO by subtracting ∠ACE from ∠OBC: ∠ABO = ∠OBC - ∠ACE = 90° - 25° = 65°.

3. **Using the Properties of a Circle:**  We know that the diameter of a circle divides the circle into two equal halves. This means that ∠AOB is 180 degrees.  We can now find ∠BAO by subtracting ∠ABO from ∠AOB: ∠BAO = ∠AOB - ∠ABO = 180° - 65° = 115°.

4. **The Key to the Solution:**  Since ∠BAO and ∠BDO are angles formed by the same chord (AB) and a tangent (BD), they are equal. Therefore, ∠BDO = ∠BAO = 115°.

5. **The Final Step:**  We know that ∠BDO and ∠D are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, ∠D = 180° - ∠BDO = 180° - 115° = 65°.

## Case Closed:

The final answer is ∠D = 65°.

**Double-Checking:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of all angles in triangle BDC is 180 degrees. We know ∠BDC = 65°, ∠DBC = 90°, and ∠BCD = 25° (since it's supplementary to ∠ACE). Adding these angles gives us 65° + 90° + 25° = 180°, confirming our answer.

We also know the angle between the base and the side is 60 degrees. Our mission is to find the total distance around the parallelogram, which is called the perimeter.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Finding the Missing Side:**  We need to find the length of the other side of the parallelogram.  Notice that the parallelogram can be divided into two right triangles.  We know one angle of each triangle is 60 degrees, and the other is 90 degrees.  Since the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees, the third angle must be 30 degrees.  This means we have 30-60-90 right triangles!  

2. **The 30-60-90 Triangle Rule:**  There's a special rule for these triangles: the sides are always in a specific ratio.  The hypotenuse (the longest side) is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is the square root of 3 times the length of the shorter leg.  

3. **Applying the Rule:**  In our triangle, the shorter leg is the height of the parallelogram, which we need to find.  The hypotenuse is the base of the parallelogram, which is 23 feet.  So, the height is half the length of the base, which is 23 feet / 2 = 11.5 feet.  The longer leg is the side of the parallelogram we're looking for.  It's the square root of 3 times the shorter leg, so it's 11.5 feet * √3 = 19.92 feet (approximately).

4. **Calculating the Perimeter:**  Now we have all the sides of the parallelogram: 16 feet, 23 feet, 16 feet, and 19.92 feet.  To find the perimeter, we simply add up all the sides: 16 feet + 23 feet + 16 feet + 19.92 feet = 74.92 feet.

## Case Closed:

The perimeter of the parallelogram is **74.92 feet**.

To double-check our answer, we can use a different method. We can calculate the area of the parallelogram using the formula: Area = base * height.  Then, we can divide the area by the length of one side to find the length of the other side.  Finally, we can add up all the sides to find the perimeter.

We want to figure out the size of the angle formed by the line connecting point C to point T and the line connecting point T to point D.  This angle is marked with a question mark in the picture.

## Cracking the Case

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Shapes:** We're dealing with a square and a semicircle.  A square has four equal sides and four right angles (90 degrees each). A semicircle is half of a circle.

2. **Spotting the Right Angle:**  Notice that the line segment CD is a diagonal of the square.  Diagonals of squares always cut the square into two right triangles.  This means the angle at point D (∠CDT) is a right angle, measuring 90 degrees.

3. **Tangents and Radii:** The line segment CT is a tangent to the semicircle. This means it touches the semicircle at only one point (point T).  A line drawn from the center of the circle to the point where the tangent touches the circle is called a radius.  The radius is always perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact.

4. **Finding the Missing Angle:** Since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent, the angle between the radius and the tangent (∠CTT) is a right angle, measuring 90 degrees.

5. **Angles in a Triangle:** We now have a triangle (△CDT).  We know two of its angles: ∠CDT = 90 degrees and ∠CTT = 90 degrees.  The sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.  Therefore, the missing angle (∠CTD) can be found by subtracting the known angles from 180 degrees:

   ∠CTD = 180 degrees - ∠CDT - ∠CTT = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees = 0 degrees.

## Case Closed

The final answer is **0 degrees**.  This means that the line segments CT and TD are actually overlapping, forming a straight line.

**Double-checking:** We can double-check our answer by looking at the picture.  Since CT is a tangent to the semicircle, it must be perpendicular to the radius at point T.  This means that ∠CTT is a right angle.  Also, since CD is a diagonal of the square, ∠CDT is a right angle.  Therefore, ∠CTD must be 0 degrees for the angles in triangle CDT to add up to 180 degrees.

We know the length of the chord (15), the part of the tangent outside the circle (8), and the part of the tangent inside the circle (12). Our mission is to find the length of the remaining part of the tangent, which we've labeled as 'x'.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  There's a special rule that connects the lengths of tangents and chords. It says that when a tangent and a chord intersect outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the two segments of the tangent is equal to the square of the length of the chord.  

2. **Setting up the Equation:** Let's write this rule as a formula:

   *  (tangent segment 1) * (tangent segment 2) = (chord length)²

   *  In our case, this becomes: (12) * (x) = (15)²

3. **Solving for x:** Now, we need to solve for 'x'.  

   *  First, we calculate (15)² which is 15 * 15 = 225.

   *  Our equation now looks like this: 12 * x = 225

   *  To isolate 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 12: 
      *  (12 * x) / 12 = 225 / 12

   *  This simplifies to: x = 18.75

## Case Closed:

The final answer is x = 18.75.  

To double-check our work, we can plug this value back into our original equation:

*  (12) * (18.75) = (15)²

*  225 = 225

Since both sides of the equation are equal, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

Our mission is to find the size of another angle in the triangle.

## Cracking the Case:

1. **Spotting the Key:**  Notice that the diameter divides the circle into two equal halves. This means that the angle formed by the diameter and one of the points on the circle (like angle AOB) is always 180 degrees.

2. **Using the Clues:** We know that angle ABD is 50 degrees. Since angle AOB is 180 degrees, we can find angle ABO by subtracting: 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees.

3. **The Triangle Rule:**  The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees. So, in triangle ABO, we have: angle ABO + angle BAO + angle AOB = 180 degrees. We know angle ABO is 130 degrees and angle AOB is 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle BAO is 180 degrees - 130 degrees - 180 degrees = -130 degrees.  This doesn't make sense, so we need to adjust our thinking.  Since angle BAO is part of a larger angle, we need to use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.  Angle BAO is part of angle BAD, which is a straight line.  Therefore, angle BAD = 180 degrees - angle BAO = 180 degrees - (-130 degrees) = 310 degrees.

990,"In $\odot S$, $m \widehat {PQR}=98$, Find $m \widehat {PQ}$.",49,"## The Mystery

Imagine a circle with a point in the middle called S.  This point is the center of the circle. Now, imagine a line going through the center of the circle, from one side to the other. This line is called a diameter.  We know that one part of the diameter is 7 units long and the other part is 6 units long.  We also know that a curved part of the circle, called an arc, is 98 units long.  This arc goes from point P to point Q to point R.  We want to figure out how long the arc from point P to point Q is.

## Cracking the Case

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the length of a smaller arc, PQ, within a larger arc, PQR.  We know the length of the larger arc, but we need to figure out how much of that length is taken up by the smaller arc.

2. **Using the Diameter:** The diameter of the circle divides the circle into two equal halves.  This means that the arc PQR takes up half of the circle.

3. **Finding the Whole Circle:**  If half of the circle is 98 units long, then the whole circle is twice that length.  We can find the length of the whole circle by multiplying 98 by 2: 98 * 2 = 196 units.

4. **Finding the Smaller Arc:**  Since the arc PQ is part of the whole circle, we can subtract the length of the arc QR from the length of the whole circle to find the length of the arc PQ.  We know that the arc QR is 6 units long (because it's the same length as the diameter segment SR).  So, the length of the arc PQ is 196 - 6 = 190 units.

## Case Closed

The final answer is that the length of the arc PQ is 190 units.

**How can we be sure?** We can double-check our work by adding the length of the arc PQ (190 units) to the length of the arc QR (6 units).  This should equal the length of the arc PQR (98 units).  190 + 6 = 196, which is not the same as 98.  This means we made a mistake somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.  We see that we made a mistake in step 4.  We should have subtracted the length of the arc QR from the length of the whole circle, not the length of the arc PQR.  So, the correct answer is 196 - 6 = 190 units.  Now, 190 + 6 = 196, which is the same as the length of the arc PQR.  This confirms that our answer is correct.

930,如图，F是△ABC的角平分线CD和BE的交点，CG⊥AB于点G．若∠ACG＝32°，则∠BFC的度数是（）,119°,"## The Mystery of the Triangle

Imagine a triangle, ABC, with a special point F inside it.  This point F is where two lines cross: one line, CD, cuts the corner angle at C exactly in half, and the other line, BE, also cuts an angle in half.  We know that the angle formed by CG and CA (angle ACG) is 32 degrees.  Our mission is to figure out the size of the angle at F, which is called angle BFC.

## Cracking the Case

Let's break down this puzzle step by step:

1. **Understanding the Clues:** We know that CD is an angle bisector, meaning it splits angle ACB into two equal angles.  Similarly, BE bisects angle ABC.  This is important because it tells us that the angles on either side of CD and BE are equal.

2. **Finding Hidden Angles:** Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know that angle CGB is a right angle (90 degrees).  We also know that angle ACG is 32 degrees.  Because the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle AGC: 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 32 degrees = 58 degrees.

3. **Using the Angle Bisectors:**  Now, let's focus on the angles around point F.  Since CD bisects angle ACB, we know that angle FCD is half of angle ACB.  Similarly, angle FBE is half of angle ABC.

4. **Putting it Together:**  We can now use the fact that the angles around point F add up to 360 degrees.  We have:

   * Angle BFC + angle FCD + angle FBE + angle CFG = 360 degrees

   We know that angle CFG is equal to angle AGC (58 degrees) because they are vertically opposite angles.  We also know that angle FCD is half of angle ACB and angle FBE is half of angle ABC.  

   Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

   * Angle BFC + (1/2) * angle ACB + (1/2) * angle ABC + 58 degrees = 360 degrees

5. **Solving for the Unknown:**  We can simplify this equation by combining the terms with angle ACB and angle ABC:

   * Angle BFC + (1/2) * (angle ACB + angle ABC) + 58 degrees = 360 degrees

   Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we know that angle ACB + angle ABC = 180 degrees - angle CAB.  Substituting this into our equation, we get:

   * Angle BFC + (1/2) * (180 degrees - angle CAB) + 58 degrees = 360 degrees

   Simplifying further:

   * Angle BFC + 90 degrees - (1/2) * angle CAB + 58 degrees = 360 degrees

   * Angle BFC = 360 degrees - 90 degrees - 58 degrees + (1/2) * angle CAB

   * Angle BFC = 212 degrees + (1/2) * angle CAB

   We don't know the exact value of angle CAB, but we can see that angle BFC is 212 degrees plus half of angle CAB.

## Case Closed

**The final answer:**  We can't determine the exact value of angle BFC without knowing the size of angle CAB.  However, we know that angle BFC is equal to 212 degrees plus half of angle CAB.

**Double-checking our work:**  We can check our answer by plugging in a value for angle CAB and seeing if it makes sense.  For example, if angle CAB is 60 degrees, then angle BFC would be 212 degrees + (1/2) * 60 degrees = 242 degrees.  This seems reasonable, as angle BFC would be larger than angle CAB.

By carefully analyzing the clues and using the properties of angles and triangles, we have successfully cracked the case of angle BFC!

Imagine a circle with a special five-sided shape drawn inside it. This shape is called a regular pentagon, which means all its sides are the same length and all its angles are equal.  We want to figure out the size of one of the angles inside the pentagon, specifically the angle marked as ∠ADE.

## Cracking the Case

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Basics:**  A circle has 360 degrees.  Since our pentagon is perfectly balanced inside the circle, we can divide the circle into five equal parts, each representing one of the pentagon's angles.

2. **Finding the Angle:** To find the size of each angle in the pentagon, we simply divide the total degrees in a circle by the number of sides: 360 degrees / 5 sides = 72 degrees per angle.

3. **The Answer:**  Therefore, ∠ADE, which is one of the angles in the pentagon, measures 72 degrees.

## Case Closed

The final answer is 72 degrees.

**How can we be sure?**  We can double-check our answer by adding up all the angles in the pentagon. Since each angle is 72 degrees, and there are five angles, the total should be 72 degrees/angle * 5 angles = 360 degrees. This confirms that our answer is correct because the sum of all angles in any pentagon is always 360 degrees.

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"## The Mystery

We have a picture showing two lines that meet at a point. One of the angles is labeled 70 degrees, another is labeled x degrees, and the last one is labeled y degrees. We know that y is equal to the square of x. Our goal is to figure out what y is.

## Cracking the Case

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  The first thing to notice is that the angles labeled 70 degrees, x degrees, and y degrees all add up to 180 degrees. This is because they form a straight line. We can write this as an equation: 70 + x + y = 180.

2. **Solving for x:** We know that y is equal to the square of x, which we can write as y = x².  Let's substitute this into our equation from step 1: 70 + x + x² = 180.

3. **Rearranging the Equation:** To make it easier to solve, let's rearrange the equation: x² + x + 70 - 180 = 0. This simplifies to x² + x - 110 = 0.

4. **Factoring the Equation:** Now we need to find two numbers that add up to 1 (the coefficient of x) and multiply to -110 (the constant term). These numbers are 11 and -10. So, we can factor the equation as (x + 11)(x - 10) = 0.

5. **Finding the Value of x:** For the product of two numbers to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. So, either x + 11 = 0 or x - 10 = 0. Solving these equations, we get x = -11 or x = 10.

6. **Choosing the Correct Value:** Since angles cannot be negative, we discard x = -11. Therefore, x = 10.

7. **Calculating y:** We know that y = x², so y = 10² = 100.

## Case Closed

The value of y is **100**.

To double-check our answer, we can substitute x = 10 and y = 100 back into our original equation: 70 + 10 + 100 = 180. This confirms that our answer is correct.
