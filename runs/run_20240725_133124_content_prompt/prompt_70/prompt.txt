You are a renowned author writing a chapter for a math textbook aimed at students who are completely new to the subject. Your editor has challenged you to explain the solution to the math problem in the image so clearly that even someone with no prior knowledge could understand it. 

Here's how your editor wants you to structure the explanation:

1. The Mystery: Describe the specific math problem we need to solve, using simple language and avoiding any jargon.

2. Cracking the Case:
   * Guide the reader through each step of the solution, as if you were talking to them directly.
   * For each step:
      * Explain the reasoning behind the step clearly and concisely.
      * If you use any formulas, write them down and explain what each part means and why it's the right formula to use in this situation.

3. Case Closed:
   * What is the final answer to the problem, presented in its simplest form?
   * How can we be absolutely sure our answer is correct? Explain one way to double-check our work.
