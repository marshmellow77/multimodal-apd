643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. **Problem:**  Find the measure of angle C in the given circle, where CD is the diameter, chord DE is parallel to OA, and angle D measures 50 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
      * Since CD is the diameter, angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.
      * Angle D and angle AOD are supplementary angles because they form a straight line.
      * Angle AOD and angle DOE are alternate interior angles because DE is parallel to OA.
   * **Step 2: Calculate angle AOD.**
      * Angle AOD = 180 degrees - angle D = 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees.
   * **Step 3: Calculate angle DOE.**
      * Angle DOE = angle AOD = 130 degrees (alternate interior angles).
   * **Step 4: Calculate angle COE.**
      * Angle COE = angle COD - angle DOE = 180 degrees - 130 degrees = 50 degrees.
   * **Step 5: Calculate angle C.**
      * Angle C = angle COE / 2 = 50 degrees / 2 = 25 degrees. This is because angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as central angle COE, and the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

3. **Answer:** The degree of angle C is 25 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant theorem. The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the theorem to ∠ABC. Since ∠ABC intercepts arc AC, we have: ∠ABC = (1/2) * measure of arc AC.
   * **Step 3:** Substitute the given value of ∠ABC: 70° = (1/2) * measure of arc AC.
   * **Step 4:** Solve for the measure of arc AC: measure of arc AC = 2 * 70° = 140°.
   * **Step 5:** Recognize that ∠AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc AC.
   * **Step 6:** Apply the central angle theorem, which states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Step 7:** Therefore, ∠AOC = measure of arc AC = 140°.

If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"1. **Problem:** What is the radius of the smaller circle if the radius of the larger circle is 4 and the centers of both circles lie on the same line?

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between the radii of the two circles. Since the centers of both circles lie on the same line, the radius of the larger circle is equal to the sum of the radius of the smaller circle and the distance between the centers of the two circles.
   * **Step 2:**  Let 'r' be the radius of the smaller circle.  The distance between the centers of the two circles is then (4 - r).
   * **Step 3:**  Apply the relationship from Step 1: 4 = r + (4 - r)
   * **Step 4:**  Simplify the equation: 4 = 4
   * **Step 5:**  The equation is true for any value of 'r'. This means the radius of the smaller circle can be any value. However, the figure shows that the smaller circle is entirely contained within the larger circle. Therefore, the radius of the smaller circle must be less than the radius of the larger circle.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant angles. We are given that ∠AOD = 70°. Since ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), we can find ∠BOD:
      ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.
   * **Step 2:**  We know that ray OE bisects ∠BOC, meaning it divides ∠BOC into two equal angles. Therefore, ∠BOE = ∠COE.
   * **Step 3:**  Since ∠BOD and ∠COE are supplementary angles, we can find ∠COE:
      ∠COE = 180° - ∠BOD = 180° - 110° = 70°.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Identify the coordinates of points A, B, and C.**
      * From the image, we can see that point A is at (3, 4), point B is at (0, 0), and point C is at (4, 1).
   * **Step 2: Calculate the slope of line BC.**
      * The slope of a line passing through points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1).
      * Applying this formula to points B and C, we get the slope of BC as (1 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 1/4.
   * **Step 3: Calculate the slope of line AD.**
      * Since AD is perpendicular to BC, the product of their slopes is -1.
      * Therefore, the slope of AD is -1 / (1/4) = -4.
   * **Step 4: Find the equation of line AD.**
      * We know the slope of AD is -4 and it passes through point A (3, 4). Using the point-slope form of a linear equation (y - y1 = m(x - x1)), we get:
         * y - 4 = -4(x - 3)
         * y - 4 = -4x + 12
         * y = -4x + 16
   * **Step 5: Find the coordinates of point D.**
      * Point D lies on both line AD and line BC. To find its coordinates, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the equations of these two lines.
      * Equation of line BC: y = (1/4)x
      * Equation of line AD: y = -4x + 16
      * Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
         * (1/4)x = -4x + 16
         * (17/4)x = 16
         * x = 64/17
      * Substituting this value of x back into the equation of line BC, we get:
         * y = (1/4) * (64/17) = 16/17
      * Therefore, the coordinates of point D are (64/17, 16/17).
   * **Step 6: Calculate the length of AD using the distance formula.**
      * The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula: √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²).
      * Applying this formula to points A (3, 4) and D (64/17, 16/17), we get:
         * AD = √((64/17 - 3)² + (16/17 - 4)²)

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Identify key properties.**
      * Since PA and PB are tangents to circle O, we know that OA is perpendicular to PA and OB is perpendicular to PB. This is because a tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.
      * Similarly, since CD is tangent to circle O, we know that OC is perpendicular to CD.
   * **Step 2: Analyze the geometry.**
      * Triangle OAP and triangle OBP are both right triangles.
      * Triangle OCD is also a right triangle.
      * Since PA = PB (tangents from an external point to a circle are equal), we have OA = OB.
   * **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem.**
      * In right triangle OAP, we have OA² + AP² = OP².
      * In right triangle OBP, we have OB² + BP² = OP².
      * Since OA = OB and AP = BP, we can conclude that OP is the same for both triangles.
   * **Step 4: Calculate the length of OP.**
      * Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OAP, we have OA² + AP² = OP².
      * Substituting AP = 8.0, we get OA² + 8² = OP².
      * Since OA is a radius of the circle, we can denote it as r. So, r² + 64 = OP².
   * **Step 5: Calculate the length of CD.**
      * In right triangle OCD, we have OC² + CD² = OD².
      * Since OC is a radius of the circle, we have r² + CD² = OD².
      * Since OD is the hypotenuse of right triangle ODP, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ODP to find OD: OD² = OP² - DP².
      * Substituting OP² = r² + 64 and DP = PA - AP = 8 - 8 = 0, we get OD² = r² + 64.
      * Therefore, r² + CD² = r² + 64, which implies CD² = 64.
      * Taking the square root of both sides, we get CD = 8.
   * **Step 6: Calculate the perimeter of triangle PCD.**
      * Perimeter of triangle PCD = PC + CD + PD.
      * Since PC = PA - AC = 8 - 8 = 0 and PD = PB - BD = 8 - 8 = 0, we have Perimeter of triangle PCD = 0 + 8 + 0 = 8.

2. Solution:
   * **Step 1: Find angle BCD.** Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle BCD is half of angle ACB. Therefore, angle BCD = angle ACB / 2.
   * **Step 2: Find angle BDC.** Since BD is perpendicular to CD, angle BDC is a right angle, which measures 90 degrees.
   * **Step 3: Find angle CBD.** The angles in triangle BCD add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle CBD = 180 degrees - angle BCD - angle BDC = 180 degrees - (angle ACB / 2) - 90 degrees = 90 degrees - (angle ACB / 2).
   * **Step 4: Find angle ABD.** We know that angle ABD = angle A.
   * **Step 5: Find angle ABC.** Angle ABC is the sum of angles ABD and CBD. Therefore, angle ABC = angle ABD + angle CBD = angle A + (90 degrees - (angle ACB / 2)).
   * **Step 6: Find angle ACB.** The angles in triangle ABC add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle ACB = 180 degrees - angle A - angle ABC = 180 degrees - angle A - (angle A + (90 degrees - (angle ACB / 2))). Simplifying this equation, we get: angle ACB = 90 degrees - 2 * angle A + (angle ACB / 2). Solving for angle ACB, we get: angle ACB = 180 degrees - 4 * angle A.
   * **Step 7: Find angle A.** We know that angle DBC = 54 degrees. Since angle DBC is part of angle ABC, we can write: angle ABC = angle DBC + angle CBD = 54 degrees + (90 degrees - (angle ACB / 2)). Substituting the value of angle ACB from step 6, we get: angle ABC = 54 degrees + (90 degrees - ((180 degrees - 4 * angle A) / 2)). Simplifying this equation, we get: angle ABC = 144 degrees + 2 * angle A.

2. Solution:
* The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  This means that $\angle JQN = \angle JQP$ and $\angle LQN = \angle LQP$.
* Since $\angle JQN = \angle JQP$, we know that $\triangle JQN \cong \triangle JQP$ by Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) congruence.  Therefore, $JN = JP$.
* Similarly, since $\angle LQN = \angle LQP$, we know that $\triangle LQN \cong \triangle LQP$ by ASA congruence.  Therefore, $LN = LP$.
* We can now use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $JN$ and $LN$.  In $\triangle JPN$, we have $JN^2 = JP^2 + PN^2 = 16.5^2 + PN^2$.  In $\triangle LPN$, we have $LN^2 = LP^2 + PN^2 = 16.5^2 + PN^2$.  Therefore, $JN = LN$.
* Since $JN = LN$ and $JN = JP$ and $LN = LP$, we know that $JP = LP$.  This means that $\triangle JLP$ is an isosceles triangle.
* Since $\triangle JLP$ is isosceles, we know that $\angle JLP = \angle JPL$.  Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^\circ$, we have $\angle JLP + \angle JPL + \angle JLN = 180^\circ$.  Substituting $\angle JLP = \angle JPL$, we get $2\angle JLP + \angle JLN = 180^\circ$.  Solving for $\angle JLP$, we get $\angle JLP = \frac{180^\circ - \angle JLN}{2}$.
* Since $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$, we know that $\angle JQL = \frac{1}{2}\angle JLN$.  Therefore, $\angle JLP = \angle JQL$.
* Since $\angle JLP = \angle JQL$ and $\angle JQP = \angle JQN$, we know that $\triangle JQL \sim \triangle JQP$ by Angle-Angle (AA) similarity.
* Since $\triangle JQL \sim \triangle JQP$, we know that $\frac{JQ}{JP} = \frac{QL}{QP}$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $QP$ and $QL$.  In $\triangle QPM$, we have $QP^2 = QM^2 + PM^2 = 9^2 + PM^2$.  In $\triangle QMN$, we have $QL^2 = QM^2 + MN^2 = 9^2 + MN^2$.  Therefore, $QP = QL$.
* Substituting $QP = QL$ into the proportion $\frac{JQ}{JP} = \frac{QL}{QP}$, we get $\frac{JQ}{JP} = 1$.  Therefore, $JQ = JP$.
* We can now use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $JQ$.  In $\triangle JPN$, we have $JQ^2 = JP^2 + PN^2 = 16.5^2 + PN^2$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $PN$.  In $\triangle QPM$, we have $PM^2 = QP^2 - QM^2 = QP^2 - 9^2$.  In $\triangle QMN$, we have $MN^2 = QL^2 - QM^2 = QL^2 - 9^2$.  Since $QP = QL$, we have $PM = MN$.  Therefore, $PN = PM + MN = 2PM$.  Substituting $PN = 2PM$ into the equation $JQ^2 = JP^2 + PN^2$, we get $JQ^2 = 16.5^2 + (2PM)^2$.  Substituting $PM^2 = QP^2 - 9^2$ into the equation $JQ^2 = 16.5^2 + (2PM)^2$, we get $JQ^2 = 16.5^2 + 4(QP^2 - 9^2)$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $QP$.

      * We also know that BE bisects angle ABC and CF bisects angle BCD.
   * **Step 3: Apply angle bisector theorem.**
      * The angle bisector theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides.
      * Applying this to triangle ABC, we have AE/EC = AB/BC.
      * Applying this to triangle BCD, we have DF/FB = CD/BC.
   * **Step 4: Use the fact that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.**

   * **Step 2:**  Apply the angle bisector property.  We are given that OD bisects ∠AOE, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts. Therefore, ∠AOD = ∠DOE.
   * **Step 3:**  Use the fact that angles around a point add up to 360°.  We have ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB + ∠BOC = 360°.  Substituting the values we know, we get ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB + 50° = 360°.
   * **Step 4:**  Simplify the equation. Since ∠AOD = ∠DOE, we can rewrite the equation as 2∠AOD + ∠EOB + 50° = 360°.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Understanding the problem:** Trapezoid ABCD has two parallel sides, AB and CD. Since AB and BC are perpendicular, we can consider triangle ABC as a right triangle.
   * **Applying the Pythagorean theorem:** In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In triangle ABC, AC is the hypotenuse, AB is one leg, and BC is the other leg. Therefore, we can write:
      * AC² = AB² + BC²
      * AC² = 24² + 16²
      * AC² = 576 + 256
      * AC² = 832
      * AC = √832 = 28.84 (approximately)
   * **Finding CD:** Now, consider the right triangle ACD. We know AD = 23 and AC = 28.84. Using the Pythagorean theorem again:
      * CD² = AC² - AD²
      * CD² = 28.84² - 23²
      * CD² = 832 - 529

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Find the measure of arc AC.**
      * Since the central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees, and arc AB is the sum of arcs AC and CB, we have:
      * ∠AOB = 90° = ∠AOC + ∠COB
      * Since ∠COB is the central angle of arc CB, and arc CB is equal to arc CD (both subtend the same central angle), we have:
      * ∠COB = ∠COD = 50°
      * Therefore, ∠AOC = ∠AOB - ∠COB = 90° - 50° = 40°
      * The measure of arc AC is equal to the measure of its central angle, so:
      * m(arc AC) = ∠AOC = 40°

   * **Step 2: Find the measure of arc BD.**
      * Since the central angle of arc CD is 50 degrees, and arc CD is the sum of arcs BD and BC, we have:
      * ∠COD = 50° = ∠BOD + ∠BOC
      * Since ∠BOC is the central angle of arc BC, and arc BC is equal to arc CB, we have:
      * ∠BOC = ∠COB = 50°
      * Therefore, ∠BOD = ∠COD - ∠BOC = 50° - 50° = 0°
      * The measure of arc BD is equal to the measure of its central angle, so:
      * m(arc BD) = ∠BOD = 0°

   * **Step 3: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * ∠P is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AC, so:
      * ∠P = 1/2 * m(arc AC) = 1/2 * 40° = 20°

   * **Step 4: Apply the Angle Addition Postulate.**
      * ∠P is the sum of ∠PAC and ∠PBC.
      * ∠PAC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BD, so:
      * ∠PAC = 1/2 * m(arc BD) = 1/2 * 0° = 0°
      * Therefore, ∠PBC = ∠P - ∠PAC = 20° - 0° = 20°

   * **Step 5: Find the measure of ∠P.**

      * The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.
      * We are given that the area of the circle is 18π square units.
      * Substituting this into the formula, we get 18π = πr².
      * Dividing both sides by π, we get 18 = r².
      * Taking the square root of both sides, we get r = √18 = 3√2.
   * **Step 2: Relate the radius of the circle to the side of the square.**
      * The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
      * The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is 2 * 3√2 = 6√2.

      * The problem provides a diagram, but it's helpful to redraw it with the given information labeled.
   * **Step 2: Identify relevant geometric relationships.**

      * The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides. In our case, this means:
         * AB/AC = BM/MC
   * **Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem.**
      * In right triangle BMN, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BM:
         * BM² = BN² - MN²
         * BM² = (BC/2)² - 2²
         * BM² = (AB + AC)/2² - 4
         * BM² = (8 + AC)/2² - 4
   * **Step 5: Substitute and solve for AC.**
      * Substitute the value of BM from Step 4 into the equation from Step 3:
         * 8/AC = √((8 + AC)/2² - 4) / MC
      * Since we don't know MC, we need to find a way to express it in terms of AC. Notice that triangles BMN and CMN are similar (they share angle M and have right angles). Therefore, we have the proportion:
         * BM/MC = BN/NC = 1
      * Substituting this into the equation above, we get:
         * 8/AC = √((8 + AC)/2² - 4)
      * Squaring both sides:
         * 64/AC² = (8 + AC)/2² - 4
      * Multiplying both sides by AC² and simplifying:
         * 64 = (8 + AC)AC² / 4 - 4AC²
         * 64 = (8 + AC)AC² - 16AC²

   * **Step 1:** Draw a diameter through point C, intersecting the circle at point D. 
   * **Reasoning:**  Drawing a diameter through point C creates a central angle of 180 degrees, which will help us find the measure of angle ACD.
   * **Step 2:** Since angle C is 30 degrees, angle ACD is 180 degrees - 30 degrees = 150 degrees.
   * **Reasoning:**  Angles ACD and ACB form a linear pair, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.
   * **Step 3:** Triangle ACD is an isosceles triangle because AC and AD are both radii of the circle. Therefore, angle CAD = angle CDA = (180 degrees - 150 degrees) / 2 = 15 degrees.

   * The triangle is isosceles, meaning that two of its sides are equal in length. 
   * We are given that $AB = 9x - 1$ and $BC = 5x - 0.5$.
   * Since the triangle is isosceles, we know that $AB = BC$.
   * Therefore, we can set up the equation: $9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5$.
   * To solve for $x$, we need to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation.
   * First, subtract $5x$ from both sides: $9x - 1 - 5x = 5x - 0.5 - 5x$.
   * This simplifies to: $4x - 1 = -0.5$.
   * Next, add $1$ to both sides: $4x - 1 + 1 = -0.5 + 1$.

      * We are given that ∠AOF = 40°.
      * Since AB is a diameter, ∠AOB = 180°.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Identify relevant properties.**
      * Since CD is a diameter, angle CED is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem).
      * Since G is the midpoint of chord EF, line segment OG is perpendicular to EF (property of a diameter bisecting a chord).
      * Therefore, triangle OGE is a right triangle.
   * **Step 2: Apply angle relationships.**
      * Angle DCF is an inscribed angle subtending arc DF.
      * Angle DOF is a central angle subtending the same arc DF.
      * Therefore, angle DOF is twice the measure of angle DCF (central angle theorem).
      * So, angle DOF = 2 * 20 degrees = 40 degrees.
   * **Step 3: Use triangle properties.**
      * In right triangle OGE, angle OGE is a right angle (90 degrees).
      * Angle EOG is half of angle DOF (angle bisector theorem).

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the central angle.  A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. In this case, the central angle is $\angle AKB$.
   * **Step 2:** Recognize the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle.  An inscribed angle is an angle whose vertex is on the circle and whose sides are chords of the circle. In this case, $\angle ADB$ is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Step 3:** Determine the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc of $\angle ADB$ is arc $AB$. Since square $ABDC$ is inscribed in the circle, arc $AB$ is one-fourth of the entire circle. Therefore, the measure of arc $AB$ is 360 degrees / 4 = 90 degrees.
   * **Step 4:** Calculate the measure of the central angle. Since $\angle ADB$ intercepts arc $AB$, its measure is half the measure of arc $AB$. Therefore, the measure of $\angle ADB$ is 90 degrees / 2 = 45 degrees.
   * **Step 5:** Apply the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles. The central angle $\angle AKB$ intercepts the same arc as the inscribed angle $\angle ADB$. Therefore, the measure of $\angle AKB$ is twice the measure of $\angle ADB$.  So, the measure of $\angle AKB$ is 45 degrees * 2 = 90 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
   * The equation x² + y² = 25 represents a circle centered at the origin (0, 0) with a radius of 5. This is because the standard form of the equation of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.
   * The maximum value of y occurs at the topmost point of the circle, which is directly above the center.

2. Solution:
   * The diagram shows two parallel lines intersected by a transversal. The angles marked with ""y"" and ""3/5y + 2"" are corresponding angles.
   * Corresponding angles formed by parallel lines are equal. Therefore, we can set up the equation: y = 3/5y + 2
   * To solve for y, we need to isolate y on one side of the equation. Subtract 3/5y from both sides: y - 3/5y = 3/5y + 2 - 3/5y
   * This simplifies to 2/5y = 2
   * Multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate y: (2/5y) * (5/2) = 2 * (5/2)

566,如图，已知△ABC≌△DEF，CD平分∠BCA，若∠A＝22°，∠CGF＝88°，则∠E的度数是（）,26°,"1. **Problem:** The problem asks to find the measure of angle E in the given figure, where triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Find angle ACB.** Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, angle ACB is equal to angle FDE.  We know that angle A is 22 degrees, and since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, angle ACB + angle A + angle ABC = 180 degrees.  Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, angle ABC is equal to angle DEF.  Therefore, angle ACB + 22 degrees + angle DEF = 180 degrees.  Since angle ACB is equal to angle FDE, we can substitute angle FDE for angle ACB, giving us angle FDE + 22 degrees + angle DEF = 180 degrees.  Since angle FDE and angle DEF are the same angle, we can combine them, giving us 2 * angle FDE + 22 degrees = 180 degrees.  Subtracting 22 degrees from both sides gives us 2 * angle FDE = 158 degrees.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us angle FDE = 79 degrees.  Therefore, angle ACB is also 79 degrees.

   * **Step 2: Find angle DCB.** Since CD bisects angle BCA, angle DCB is half of angle ACB.  Therefore, angle DCB = 79 degrees / 2 = 39.5 degrees.

   * **Step 3: Find angle GCD.** Since angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees, angle GCD + angle DCB = 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle GCD = 180 degrees - 39.5 degrees = 140.5 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Find angle GCF.** Since angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, angle GCF + angle CGF + angle GCD = 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle GCF = 180 degrees - 88 degrees - 140.5 degrees = -48.5 degrees.  However, angles cannot be negative, so we need to adjust our calculations.  Since angle GCD is greater than 180 degrees, it means that angle GCF is actually on the other side of line CD.  Therefore, we need to subtract angle GCD from 360 degrees to find the actual measure of angle GCF.  This gives us angle GCF = 360 degrees - 140.5 degrees = 219.5 degrees.

   * **Step 5: Find angle E.** Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, angle E is equal to angle B.  Since angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, angle B + angle A + angle ACB = 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle B = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - 79 degrees = 79 degrees.  Therefore, angle E is also 79 degrees.

      * Angle BCD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BD.
      * Angle AOD is a central angle that also intercepts arc BD.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, angle BCD is half the measure of arc BD.
   * **Step 3:** Apply the Central Angle Theorem.
      * The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, angle AOD is equal to the measure of arc BD.
   * **Step 4:** Combine the theorems to find angle AOD.
      * Since angle BCD is half the measure of arc BD, and angle AOD is equal to the measure of arc BD, then angle AOD is twice the measure of angle BCD.

      * ∠ANQ + ∠CNQ + ∠AQN + ∠CQN = 360°
   * **Combining Information:** Since ∠AMP = ∠BMP and ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ, we can simplify the above equations:

      * ∠APM + ∠AQN = 110°
   * **Solving for ∠PAQ:**  Finally, we can find ∠PAQ by subtracting the sum of ∠APM and ∠AQN from 360°:
      * ∠PAQ = 360° - (∠APM + ∠AQN) = 360° - 110° = 250°

   * **Step 3:**  Set up an equation to solve for *x*.  Since arc $CH$ is congruent to arc $KJ$, their measures are equal.  The measure of arc $CH$ is $83^\circ$, and the measure of arc $KJ$ is $(2x-27)^\circ$.  Therefore, we can write the equation: $83^\circ = (2x-27)^\circ$.

2. Solution:
   * The center of mass of a triangle is located at the centroid, which is the point where the three medians of the triangle intersect.
   * A median is a line segment drawn from a vertex of the triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side.
   * The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio.
   * In this case, the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, so the median from the right angle vertex bisects the base and is also the altitude of the triangle.
   * The length of the base is 2a, so the midpoint of the base is at x = a.
   * The height of the triangle is also a.
   * Therefore, the centroid is located at a distance of (2/3)a from the base and (1/3)a from the vertex.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Simplify the circuit.**
      * Notice that the circuit is symmetrical. We can simplify it by considering only half of the circuit, from terminal a to the point where the next set of resistors starts. This is because the other half of the circuit is identical.
      * The simplified circuit consists of three resistors in parallel: one with resistance R, one with resistance R, and one with resistance R + the equivalent resistance of the remaining infinite chain.
   * **Step 2: Define the equivalent resistance.**
      * Let's call the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain R_eq.
   * **Step 3: Apply the formula for parallel resistors.**
      * The equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel is given by: 1/R_eq = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...
      * In our simplified circuit, this becomes: 1/R_eq = 1/R + 1/R + 1/(R + R_eq)
   * **Step 4: Solve for R_eq.**
      * Substitute R = 1: 1/R_eq = 1/1 + 1/1 + 1/(1 + R_eq)
      * Simplify: 1/R_eq = 2 + 1/(1 + R_eq)
      * Multiply both sides by R_eq(1 + R_eq): 1 + R_eq = 2R_eq(1 + R_eq) + R_eq
      * Expand: 1 + R_eq = 2R_eq + 2R_eq^2 + R_eq
      * Rearrange: 2R_eq^2 + 2R_eq - 1 = 0
      * Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: R_eq = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
      * Where a = 2, b = 2, and c = -1.
      * Calculate: R_eq = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4 * 2 * -1)) / (2 * 2)
      * Simplify: R_eq = (-2 ± √12) / 4
      * R_eq = (-2 ± 2√3) / 4
      * R_eq = (-1 ± √3) / 2
      * We discard the negative solution because resistance cannot be negative.
      * Therefore, R_eq = (-1 + √3) / 2
   * **Step 5: Calculate the resistance between terminals a and b.**
      * Since we simplified the circuit by considering only half of it, the resistance between terminals a and b is half of the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain.
      * Resistance between a and b = R_eq / 2 = ((-1 + √3) / 2) / 2 = (-1 + √3) / 4

228,"As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of circle O, DB and DC are respectively tangent to circle O at points B and C. If ∠ACE = 25.0, then the degree of ∠D is ()",50°,"1. **Problem:** The problem asks to find the degree measure of angle D, given that AB is the diameter of circle O, DB and DC are tangents to circle O, and ∠ACE = 25.0 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
      * Since DB and DC are tangents to circle O, we know that ∠DBO and ∠DCO are both right angles (90 degrees). This is because a tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
      * ∠ABO is also a right angle because AB is the diameter of the circle, and any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.
      * ∠ACE and ∠ACB are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.

   * **Step 2: Calculate ∠ACB.**
      * ∠ACB = 180° - ∠ACE = 180° - 25° = 155°.

   * **Step 3: Calculate ∠ABC.**
      * ∠ABC = 180° - ∠ABO - ∠ACB = 180° - 90° - 155° = -65°.
      * Since angles cannot be negative, we add 360° to get ∠ABC = -65° + 360° = 295°.

   * **Step 4: Calculate ∠DBC.**
      * ∠DBC = 360° - ∠ABC - ∠DBO = 360° - 295° - 90° = -25°.
      * Again, we add 360° to get ∠DBC = -25° + 360° = 335°.

   * **Step 5: Calculate ∠D.**
      * ∠D = 180° - ∠DBC - ∠DCO = 180° - 335° - 90° = -245°.
      * Adding 360° to get a positive angle, we have ∠D = -245° + 360° = 115°.

737,Find the perimeter of the parallelogram.,78,"1. **Problem:** The problem asks to find the perimeter of a parallelogram with a base of 16 feet, a height of 23 feet, and an angle of 60 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Find the length of the other side of the parallelogram.**
      * We can use trigonometry to find the length of the other side. Since we know the height, the base, and the angle, we can use the tangent function:
      * tan(60°) = height / (length of other side)
      * tan(60°) = 23 / (length of other side)
      * (length of other side) = 23 / tan(60°)
      * (length of other side) = 23 / √3
      * (length of other side) = 23√3 / 3
   * **Step 2: Calculate the perimeter.**
      * The perimeter of a parallelogram is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
      * Perimeter = 2 * (base + length of other side)
      * Perimeter = 2 * (16 + 23√3 / 3)

757,Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.,7.2,"1. **Problem:** Find the length of segment *x* in the given diagram, rounded to the nearest tenth.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Identify the relevant theorem:** The problem involves a circle and tangents, so we can use the Tangent-Tangent Theorem. This theorem states that if two tangents are drawn to a circle from the same external point, then the segments of the tangents from the external point to the points of tangency are congruent.
   * **Apply the theorem:** In the diagram, we see that segments of length 12 and 8 are tangents drawn from the same external point. Therefore, according to the Tangent-Tangent Theorem, these segments are congruent.
   * **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** We can now use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of *x*. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, *x* is the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are 12 and 8.
   * **Calculate:**  
      *  x² = 12² + 8²
      *  x² = 144 + 64
      *  x² = 208
      *  x = √208 ≈ 14.4

2. **Solution:**
   * **Understanding the problem:** We are given a circle with a central angle that intercepts arc PQR. We need to find the measure of a smaller arc PQ.
   * **Key concept:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Applying the concept:** Since angle PSQ is a central angle that intercepts arc PQR, we know that  m∠PSQ = m arc PQR = 98 degrees.
   * **Finding the measure of arc PQ:**  Arc PQ is a part of arc PQR.  Therefore, m arc PQ = m arc PQR - m arc QR.  We know m arc PQR = 98 degrees.  Since line segment SR is a radius of the circle, we know that m arc QR = 180 degrees.
   * **Calculation:** m arc PQ = 98 degrees - 180 degrees = -82 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Since CG is perpendicular to AB, angle CGB is a right angle (90 degrees).
   * **Step 2:** We know that angle ACG is 32 degrees. Therefore, angle BCG = angle CGB - angle ACG = 90 degrees - 32 degrees = 58 degrees.
   * **Step 3:** CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB. Therefore, angle ACD = angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB.
   * **Step 4:** Since angle BCG is 58 degrees, angle ACB = angle ACG + angle BCG = 32 degrees + 58 degrees = 90 degrees.
   * **Step 5:** Therefore, angle ACD = angle BCD = (1/2) * 90 degrees = 45 degrees.
   * **Step 6:** Similarly, BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC. Therefore, angle ABE = angle CBE = (1/2) * angle ABC.
   * **Step 7:** In triangle BFC, we have angle BFC = 180 degrees - angle FBC - angle FCB.
   * **Step 8:** Angle FBC = angle CBE = (1/2) * angle ABC.
   * **Step 9:** Angle FCB = angle BCD = 45 degrees.
   * **Step 10:** Therefore, angle BFC = 180 degrees - (1/2) * angle ABC - 45 degrees.
   * **Step 11:** To find angle ABC, we can use the fact that the angles in triangle ABC add up to 180 degrees: angle ABC + angle ACB + angle BAC = 180 degrees.
   * **Step 12:** We know that angle ACB is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle ABC + angle BAC = 90 degrees.
   * **Step 13:** Since CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB, angle BAC = angle ACD = 45 degrees.
   * **Step 14:** Therefore, angle ABC = 90 degrees - 45 degrees = 45 degrees.
   * **Step 15:** Finally, we can substitute the value of angle ABC into the equation for angle BFC: angle BFC = 180 degrees - (1/2) * 45 degrees - 45 degrees = 90 degrees.

955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"1. **Problem:** What is the measure of angle ADE in the given regular pentagon ABCDE inscribed in circle O?

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Find the measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon.
      * The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees.
      * For a pentagon (n=5), the sum of interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.
      * Since it's a regular pentagon, all interior angles are equal, so each angle measures 540 degrees / 5 = 108 degrees.
   * **Step 2:**  Recognize that triangle ADE is isosceles.
      * Since AB = AE (sides of a regular pentagon), and AO = DO (radii of the circle), triangles AOD and BOE are congruent by SSS.
      * Therefore, angle AOD = angle BOD, and angle AOE = angle DOE.
      * This means angle ADE is bisected by line segment DO, making triangle ADE isosceles with AD = DE.
   * **Step 3:**  Calculate the measure of angle ADE.
      * In isosceles triangle ADE, angle ADE = angle AED.
      * The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so angle ADE + angle AED + angle DAE = 180 degrees.
      * Substituting angle ADE for angle AED and 108 degrees for angle DAE, we get: 2 * angle ADE + 108 degrees = 180 degrees.
      * Solving for angle ADE: 2 * angle ADE = 72 degrees, so angle ADE = 36 degrees.
