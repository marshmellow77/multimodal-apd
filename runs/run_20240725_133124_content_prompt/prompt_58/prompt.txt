Imagine you are writing a detailed solution guide for a math textbook. Your goal is to make sure any student, regardless of their skill level, can understand the solution to the math problem in the image. 

Please structure your guide as follows:

Problem:
* State the problem clearly, as it would appear in a textbook.

Solution:
* Break down the solution into numbered steps.
* For each step: 
    * Clearly describe the operation being performed.
    * Explain the reasoning behind the step in a way that anyone could understand.
    * If a formula is used, write out the formula, then explain what each part of the formula represents and why it is being used in this specific step.  

Example:

1. Calculate the area of the circle.
     * We can use the formula for the area of a circle:  Area = π * r² 
     * In this formula, π represents pi (approximately 3.14), and 'r' represents the radius of the circle.  We are using this formula because the problem asks us to find the area of a circular shape.

Solution Verification:
* What is the final answer to the problem?
* How can we be absolutely sure our answer is correct? Are there any other methods we could use to solve this problem and check our work?
