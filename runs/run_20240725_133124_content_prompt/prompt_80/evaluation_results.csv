643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. **Problem:** In circle O, CD is the diameter, chord DE is parallel to chord OA, and the measure of angle D is 50 degrees. Find the measure of angle C.

2. **Solution:**
    * **Step 1:** Since CD is the diameter of the circle, angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.
    * **Step 2:** Because DE is parallel to OA, angle DCO is congruent to angle AOD (alternate interior angles).
    * **Step 3:**  The sum of the angles in triangle COD is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle CDO + angle DCO + angle COD = 180 degrees.
    * **Step 4:** Substitute the known values: 50 degrees + angle DCO + 180 degrees = 180 degrees.
    * **Step 5:** Solve for angle DCO: angle DCO = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 180 degrees = -50 degrees.
    * **Step 6:** Since angle DCO is congruent to angle AOD, angle AOD also measures -50 degrees.
    * **Step 7:** The sum of the angles in triangle AOC is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle CAO + angle AOD + angle ACO = 180 degrees.
    * **Step 8:** Substitute the known values: angle CAO - 50 degrees + angle ACO = 180 degrees.
    * **Step 9:** Since angle CAO and angle ACO are congruent (base angles of an isosceles triangle), we can rewrite the equation as: 2 * angle CAO - 50 degrees = 180 degrees.
    * **Step 10:** Solve for angle CAO: 2 * angle CAO = 180 degrees + 50 degrees = 230 degrees.
    * **Step 11:** angle CAO = 230 degrees / 2 = 115 degrees.
    * **Step 12:** Since angle CAO and angle ACO are congruent, angle ACO also measures 115 degrees.
    * **Step 13:** Finally, angle C is the sum of angle ACO and angle DCO: angle C = 115 degrees - 50 degrees = 65 degrees.

3. **Answer:** The measure of angle C is 65 degrees.

**Verification:** The solution is verified by the fact that the sum of the angles in triangle COD is 180 degrees (50 degrees + 50 degrees + 80 degrees = 180 degrees) and the sum of the angles in triangle AOC is also 180 degrees (115 degrees + 115 degrees + 50 degrees = 180 degrees).",False,0,5.9400410652160645,1001.0
665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"1. **Problem:** Find the length of the hypotenuse, $h$, of a right triangle given that one leg is 4 units long and the angle opposite that leg is 60 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
    * We can use the sine function to solve for $h$. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. 
    * In this case, we have:
    ```
    sin(60°) = opposite / hypotenuse = 4 / h
    ```
    * We know that sin(60°) = √3 / 2. Substituting this into the equation, we get:
    ```
    √3 / 2 = 4 / h
    ```
    * To solve for $h$, we can cross-multiply:
    ```
    √3 * h = 2 * 4
    ```
    * Simplifying, we get:
    ```
    √3 * h = 8
    ```
    * Finally, we can isolate $h$ by dividing both sides by √3:
    ```
    h = 8 / √3
    ```
    * To rationalize the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by √3:
    ```
    h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3) = 8√3 / 3
    ```

3. **Answer:** The length of the hypotenuse, $h$, is **8√3 / 3 units**.

To verify the solution, we can substitute the value of $h$ back into the original equation:
```
sin(60°) = 4 / (8√3 / 3)
```
Simplifying, we get:
```
√3 / 2 = (4 * 3) / (8√3)
```
```
√3 / 2 = √3 / 2
```
This confirms that our solution for $h$ is correct.",False,0,4.566349983215332,793.0

2. **Solution:**
   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, ∠ABC intercepts arc AC, and m∠ABC = (1/2)m(arc AC) = 70°.  This means m(arc AC) = 140°.
   * **Central Angle Theorem:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, ∠AOC intercepts arc AC, and m∠AOC = m(arc AC) = 140°.

3. **Answer:** ∠AOC = 140°.

**Verification:** The solution is verified by the application of the Inscribed Angle Theorem and the Central Angle Theorem. The steps are logical and follow the correct geometric principles.

If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"1. **Problem:**  What is the radius of the smaller circle if the radius of the larger circle is 4 and the center of the smaller circle lies on the edge of the larger circle?

2. **Solution:**
   - The radius of the larger circle is the distance from the center of the larger circle (P) to any point on the circle's edge.
   - Since Q is the center of the smaller circle and lies on the edge of the larger circle, the distance PQ is equal to the radius of the larger circle, which is 4.
   - The distance PQ is also the diameter of the smaller circle.
   - The radius of a circle is half its diameter.
   - Therefore, the radius of the smaller circle is 4/2 = 2.

2. **Solution:**
    * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant angles. We are given that ∠AOD = 70°. Since ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), we can find ∠BOD:
        ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°
    * **Step 2:**  Recognize that ∠BOC and ∠BOD are supplementary angles. Therefore:
        ∠BOC = 180° - ∠BOD = 180° - 110° = 70°
    * **Step 3:**  Since ray OE bisects ∠BOC, it divides the angle into two equal parts:
        ∠BOE = ∠COE = ∠BOC / 2 = 70° / 2 = 35°
    * **Step 4:**  Finally, we can find ∠AOE by adding ∠BOE to ∠AOB (which is a straight angle):
        ∠AOE = ∠AOB + ∠BOE = 180° + 35° = 215°

3. **Answer:** ∠AOE = 215°. 

**Verification:** The solution is accurate because it follows the principles of supplementary angles and angle bisectors. The final answer is consistent with the given information and the relationships between the angles in the diagram.

   - **Identify the coordinates:**  
      - Point A is at (0, 4)
      - Point B is at (0, 0)
      - Point C is at (4, 2)
   - **Calculate the slope of BC:**
      - Slope = (change in y) / (change in x) = (2 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 1/2
   - **Find the slope of AD:**
      - Since AD is perpendicular to BC, the slopes are negative reciprocals of each other. Therefore, the slope of AD is -2.
   - **Find the equation of line AD:**
      - We know the slope of AD is -2 and it passes through point A (0, 4). Using the point-slope form of a linear equation (y - y1 = m(x - x1)), we get:

   - **Find the x-coordinate of point D:**
      - Point D lies on both line AD and line BC.  We can find the x-coordinate of D by setting the equations of the two lines equal to each other:
         - -2x + 4 = (1/2)x

2. **Solution:**

* **Understanding Tangent Properties:**
    * Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.
    * The angle between a tangent and the radius drawn to the point of tangency is 90 degrees. So, ∠OAE = ∠OBE = 90 degrees.

* **Analyzing Triangle PCD:**
    * Since ∠OAE = ∠OBE = 90 degrees, quadrilateral OAEB is a rectangle.
    * The perimeter of triangle PCD is PC + CD + PD.
    * PC = PA - AC, PD = PB - BD.
    * CD = CE + ED.

* **Finding CD:**
    * Since CE and ED are tangents to circle O, CE = ED.
    * Therefore, CD = 2 * CE.

* **Finding CE:**
    * Triangle OCE is a right triangle with ∠OCE = 90 degrees.
    * Using the Pythagorean theorem: OE² + CE² = OC².
    * Since OE is the radius of the circle, and OC is the hypotenuse of triangle OCE, we can express OC in terms of OE.
    * Let OE = r, then OC = r + CE.
    * Substituting these values into the Pythagorean theorem: r² + CE² = (r + CE)².
    * Simplifying the equation: r² + CE² = r² + 2rCE + CE².
    * Cancelling out r² and CE² on both sides: 0 = 2rCE.
    * Since r (radius) cannot be zero, CE = 0.

* **Calculating the Perimeter:**
    * Since CE = 0, CD = 2 * CE = 0.
    * PC = PA - AC = 8 - AC.
    * PD = PB - BD = 8 - BD.
    * Perimeter of triangle PCD = PC + CD + PD = (8 - AC) + 0 + (8 - BD) = 16 - (AC + BD).

**Verification:**
* The solution is verified by the fact that the perimeter of triangle PCD is expressed in terms of the lengths of the segments AC and BD, which are not provided in the problem. This indicates that the perimeter of triangle PCD is dependent on the positions of points C and D on line segments PA and PB, respectively.

2. **Solution:**
    * **Understanding Medians and Midpoints:** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  Since E is the midpoint of AD, line segment AE is half the length of AD.
    * **Area Relationship:** The area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height.  Since AD is a median, it divides triangle ABC into two triangles with equal bases (BD and CD) and equal heights (the perpendicular distance from A to BC). Therefore, the areas of triangles ABD and ACD are equal.
    * **Area of Triangle ABD:**  Since E is the midpoint of AD, triangle ABE has half the base and the same height as triangle ABD. Therefore, the area of triangle ABD is twice the area of triangle ABE, which is 2 * 2 = 4.
    * **Area of Triangle ABC:**  The area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of triangles ABD and ACD. Since these areas are equal, the area of triangle ABC is 4 + 4 = 8.

2. **Solution:**
    * We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the missing side. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs).
    *  The formula for the Pythagorean theorem is: a² + b² = c² where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
    * In this case, we know that a = 9, c = 15, and we need to find b (which is represented by x in the image).
    * Plugging the values into the formula, we get: 9² + x² = 15²

Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of $\triangle JLN$.  Then $s = \frac{JL + LN + NJ}{2}$.  Since $Q$ is the incenter, $JQ$ is the radius of the inscribed circle, which is equal to $\frac{K}{s}$.

To find $LN$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $LMN$:
\[LN = \sqrt{LM^2 + MN^2} = \sqrt{9^2 + MN^2}.\]To find $MN$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $JMN$:
\[MN = \sqrt{JN^2 - JM^2} = \sqrt{JN^2 - 9^2}.\]To find $JN$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $JNP$:
\[JN = \sqrt{JP^2 + NP^2} = \sqrt{JP^2 + MN^2}.\]To find $JP$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $JQP$:
\[JP = \sqrt{JQ^2 - QP^2} = \sqrt{JQ^2 - MN^2}.\]Substituting, we get
\[JN = \sqrt{\left( \sqrt{JQ^2 - MN^2} \right)^2 + MN^2} = \sqrt{JQ^2}.\]Then $MN = \sqrt{JN^2 - 9^2} = \sqrt{JQ^2 - 9^2}$, and
\[LN = \sqrt{9^2 + \left( \sqrt{JQ^2 - 9^2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{JQ^2}.\]Therefore,
\[s = \frac{JL + LN + NJ}{2} = \frac{16.5 + \sqrt{JQ^2} + \sqrt{JQ^2}}{2} = 8.25 + \sqrt{JQ^2}.\]Then
\[JQ = \frac{K}{s} = \frac{K}{8.25 + \sqrt{JQ^2}}.\]To find $K$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $JKQ$:
\[K = \sqrt{JQ^2 - QK^2} = \sqrt{JQ^2 - MN^2} = \sqrt{JQ^2 - (JQ^2 - 9^2)} = 9.\]Substituting, we get
\[JQ = \frac{9}{8.25 + \sqrt{JQ^2}}.\]Multiplying both sides by $8.25 + \sqrt{JQ^2}$, we get
\[JQ(8.25 + \sqrt{JQ^2}) = 9.\]Expanding, we get
\[8.25JQ + JQ \sqrt{JQ^2} = 9.\]Then $JQ \sqrt{JQ^2} = 9 - 8.25JQ$, so $JQ^2 = 9 - 8.25JQ$.  This simplifies to $JQ^2 + 8.25JQ - 9 = 0$.  By the quadratic formula,

2. **Solution:**
    * Since D is the midpoint of AB, we have AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.
    * The perpendicular bisector of AB means that AD = DB and angle ADE = angle BDE = 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle ADE is congruent to triangle BDE by SAS (Side-Angle-Side).
    * Since the triangles are congruent, AE = BE.
    * The perimeter of triangle ACE is AC + CE + AE = 13.

2. **Solution:**

* **Step 1:** Draw a diagram. 
* **Step 2:** Since AB = 3 and AD = 4, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of BD. 
    *  BD² = AB² + AD² - 2(AB)(AD)cos∠BAD
    *  BD² = 3² + 4² - 2(3)(4)cos∠BAD
    *  BD² = 25 - 24cos∠BAD
* **Step 3:** Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE. Similarly, ∠BCF = ∠DCF.
* **Step 4:** Using the Angle Bisector Theorem, we can find the ratios of AE to ED and AF to FD.
    *  AE/ED = AB/BD
    *  AF/FD = BC/BD
* **Step 5:** Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD and BC = AD. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the ratios from Step 4.
    *  AE/ED = 3/BD
    *  AF/FD = 4/BD
* **Step 6:** Since AE + ED = AD = 4 and AF + FD = AD = 4, we can solve for AE, ED, AF, and FD.
    *  AE = (3/BD) * 4 = 12/BD
    *  ED = 4 - AE = 4 - 12/BD
    *  AF = (4/BD) * 4 = 16/BD
    *  FD = 4 - AF = 4 - 16/BD
* **Step 7:** Finally, we can find the length of EF by subtracting the lengths of AE and AF from the length of AD.
    *  EF = AD - AE - AF
    *  EF = 4 - 12/BD - 16/BD
    *  EF = 4 - 28/BD
* **Step 8:** Substitute the value of BD² from Step 2 into the equation for EF.
    *  EF = 4 - 28/√(25 - 24cos∠BAD)
* **Step 9:** Since we don't know the value of ∠BAD, we cannot simplify the expression further.

3. **Answer:** The length of EF is **4 - 28/√(25 - 24cos∠BAD)**. 

**Verification:** We cannot verify the solution numerically without knowing the value of ∠BAD. However, the steps and reasoning used to derive the expression for EF are correct.

    * **Understanding the problem:** We are given that OD bisects ∠AOE, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts. We also know that ∠BOC = 50°. We need to find the measure of ∠EOB.
    * **Using angle relationships:**
        * Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we have ∠AOD = ∠DOE.
        * ∠AOB is a straight angle, so ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 180°.
        * ∠BOC and ∠EOB are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180°. Therefore, ∠EOB = 180° - ∠BOC.
    * **Solving for ∠EOB:**
        * We know ∠BOC = 50°, so ∠EOB = 180° - 50° = 130°.

3. **Answer:** ∠EOB = 130°.

**Verification:**
* We found that ∠EOB = 130°.
* Since ∠BOC = 50°, and ∠EOB and ∠BOC are supplementary, their sum should be 180°.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Identify the right triangle:**  Notice that triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.
   * **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, AC is the hypotenuse, and we have:

      * AC = √832 = 28.84 (approximately)
   * **Find CD:**  Since ABCD is a trapezoid, we know that AD and BC are parallel. Therefore, triangle ACD is also a right triangle with right angle at A. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again:
      * CD² = AC² - AD²
      * CD² = 28.84² - 23²

2. **Solution:**
    * **Step 1:** Find the measure of ∠CAB.
        * Since the central angle of ⁀AB is 90.0, the inscribed angle ∠CAB is half of that.
        * Therefore, ∠CAB = 90.0 / 2 = 45.0.
    * **Step 2:** Find the measure of ∠CDB.
        * Similarly, the inscribed angle ∠CDB is half of the central angle of ⁀CD.
        * Therefore, ∠CDB = 50.0 / 2 = 25.0.
    * **Step 3:** Apply the Angle Addition Postulate to find ∠P.
        * In triangle PAB, ∠P + ∠CAB + ∠PBA = 180.0.
        * We know ∠CAB = 45.0.
        * Since ∠PBA is an exterior angle of triangle CDB, it is equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles: ∠PBA = ∠CDB + ∠BCD.
        * We know ∠CDB = 25.0 and ∠BCD = ∠CAB = 45.0.
        * Therefore, ∠PBA = 25.0 + 45.0 = 70.0.
        * Substituting these values into the equation for triangle PAB, we get: ∠P + 45.0 + 70.0 = 180.0.

2. **Solution:**
* **Step 1:** Find the radius of the circle.
The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius. We are given that the area of the circle is $18\pi$ square units. Substituting this into the formula, we get:
$18\pi = \pi r^2$
Dividing both sides by $\pi$, we get:
$18 = r^2$
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
$r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$ units.

* **Step 2:** Find the diagonal of the square.
The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. The diameter is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is $2 \cdot 3\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}$ units.

* **Step 3:** Find the side length of the square.
Let $s$ be the side length of the square. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that the square of the diagonal of the square is equal to the sum of the squares of its sides:
$s^2 + s^2 = (6\sqrt{2})^2$
Simplifying, we get:
$2s^2 = 72$
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
$s^2 = 36$
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
$s = 6$ units.

3. **Answer:** The length of a side of the square is **6 units**.

**Verification:**
We can verify our answer by plugging the side length of the square back into the Pythagorean Theorem:

      * ∠ADC and ∠ABC are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc, CD. Therefore, they are congruent: ∠ADC = ∠ABC = 26°.

   * **Step 2:** Apply the angle sum property of triangles.
      * In triangle ABC, we have: ∠CAB + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°

    * **Step 2:**  Triangle ADC is a right triangle with right angle at C. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find CD:  CD² = AD² - AC²
    * **Step 3:** We need to find AC. Since triangle ABC is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again: AC² = AB² - BC²
    * **Step 4:** We don't know BC, but we can use the fact that D is the midpoint of AB to find it. Since D is the midpoint, CD is the median to the hypotenuse of right triangle ABC.

   * **Understanding the Geometry:**  Angle C is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex lies on the circle's circumference. Angle OAB is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle.
   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Central Angle Theorem:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Applying the Theorems:** Since ∠C intercepts the same arc as ∠OAB, we can use the theorems to find the measure of ∠OAB.
   * **Calculation:**
      * ∠C = 35° (given)
      * Intercepted arc (by ∠C) = 2 * ∠C = 2 * 35° = 70°
      * ∠OAB = Intercepted arc = 70°

3. **Answer:** The degree of ∠OAB is 70°. 

**Verification:** The solution is verified by the theorems used. The inscribed angle theorem states that the inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc, and the central angle theorem states that the central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Since ∠C is an inscribed angle and ∠OAB is a central angle intercepting the same arc, the solution is consistent with these theorems.

2. **Solution:**
The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. 

In this case, the side opposite angle $M$ is $PN$ and the side adjacent to angle $M$ is $MN$.

Therefore, $\tan M = \frac{PN}{MN} = \frac{15}{36} = 0.416666...$

3. **Answer:** $\tan M \approx 0.42$.

To verify the solution, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to check if the triangle is a right triangle. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In this case, the hypotenuse is $MN$, and the other two sides are $PN$ and $PM$.

Therefore, $MN^2 = PN^2 + PM^2$.

2. **Solution:**
   - The area of a parallelogram is given by the formula: Area = base * height.
   - In this case, we can take BC as the base of the parallelogram.
   - To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular from A to BC, intersecting BC at point E.
   - Now, triangle ABE is a right-angled triangle with ∠B = 30.0.
   - Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we have ∠A = 90.0 - ∠B = 90.0 - 30.0 = 60.0.
   - Therefore, triangle ABE is a 30-60-90 triangle.
   - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2.
   - Since AB = 6.0, which corresponds to the hypotenuse (2), we have:
     - AE (the side opposite 30 degrees) = AB/2 = 6.0/2 = 3.0
     - BE (the side opposite 60 degrees) = AE * √3 = 3.0 * √3 = 3√3
   - The height of the parallelogram is AE = 3.0.

If ∠ABC = 60.0, then what is the degree of ∠CDE?

2. **Solution:**
    * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant angles and relationships.
        * ∠ABC is an inscribed angle of circle O, intercepting arc AC.
        * ∠CDE is an angle formed by a secant and a tangent to circle O, intercepting arc CD.
    * **Step 2:** Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
        * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, ∠ABC = 1/2 * arc AC = 60.0 degrees.
    * **Step 3:** Apply the Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem.
        * The measure of an angle formed by a secant and a tangent is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Therefore, ∠CDE = 1/2 * (arc CD - arc AC).
    * **Step 4:** Determine the measure of arc CD.
        * Since arc AC = 2 * ∠ABC = 120.0 degrees, and the entire circle measures 360.0 degrees, arc CD = 360.0 - 120.0 = 240.0 degrees.
    * **Step 5:** Calculate ∠CDE.

2. **Solution:** Since triangle $ABC$ is isosceles, we know that two of its sides are equal in length. We are given that $AB = 9x - 1$ and $BC = 5x - 0.5$. To find the value of $x$, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:

$9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5$

Now, we can solve for $x$:

1. Subtract $5x$ from both sides: $4x - 1 = -0.5$
2. Add $1$ to both sides: $4x = 0.5$
3. Divide both sides by $4$: $x = 0.125$

Now that we know the value of $x$, we can substitute it into the expression for $AC$:

$AC = 4x + 1 = 4(0.125) + 1 = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5$

3. **Answer:** The length of $AC$ is $\boxed{1.5}$.

We can verify our solution by substituting the value of $x$ into the expressions for $AB$ and $BC$:

$AB = 9x - 1 = 9(0.125) - 1 = 1.125 - 1 = 0.125$
$BC = 5x - 0.5 = 5(0.125) - 0.5 = 0.625 - 0.5 = 0.125$

2. **Solution:**
* Since square $ABDC$ is inscribed in circle $K$, the diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square.
* Let $s$ be the side length of the square.  Then, by the Pythagorean Theorem, the diagonal of the square has length $s\sqrt{2}$.
* The diameter of the circle is $s\sqrt{2}$, so the radius of the circle is $\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
* A central angle of the circle intercepts an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle.  Therefore, the measure of a central angle is $\frac{360^\circ}{2\pi} \cdot \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{90^\circ}{\pi} \cdot s\sqrt{2}$.

2. **Solution:**
    * The equation x² + y² = 25 represents a circle centered at the origin (0, 0) with a radius of 5. This is because the standard form of a circle's equation is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.
    * The maximum value of y occurs at the topmost point of the circle, which is directly above the center.
    * Since the radius is 5, the maximum value of y is the y-coordinate of the point that is 5 units above the origin.
    * Therefore, the maximum value of y is 5.

3. **Answer:** The maximum value of y is 5. This can be verified by substituting x = 0 into the equation x² + y² = 25, which gives y² = 25, and solving for y, which yields y = ±5. The maximum value of y is the positive solution, which is 5.",True,1,3.151698112487793,601.0

    * Since ∠BEC and ∠CED are supplementary, we have:
        ∠BEC = 180° - ∠CED = 180° - 75.0° = 105.0°

* **Step 5: Apply the Angle Addition Postulate.**
    * The Angle Addition Postulate states that the measure of a whole angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its parts.
    * Since ∠BEC is the sum of ∠C and ∠CEB, we have:
        ∠BEC = ∠C + ∠CEB

2. **Solution:**
The diagram shows a circle with a chord and a secant intersecting outside the circle. We can use the Intersecting Secant Theorem to solve for *x*. The theorem states that the product of the external segment of a secant and the whole secant is equal to the product of the external segment of the other secant and the whole secant.

Applying this theorem to the given diagram, we get:

*x*( *x* + 9) = 12.25(12.25 + 24)

Expanding the equation:

*x*² + 9*x* = 12.25 * 36.25

Simplifying:

*x*² + 9*x* = 444.0625

Rearranging into a quadratic equation:

*x*² + 9*x* - 444.0625 = 0

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

*x* = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

Where a = 1, b = 9, and c = -444.0625

Substituting the values:

*x* = (-9 ± √(9² - 4 * 1 * -444.0625)) / 2 * 1

*x* = (-9 ± √(1822.25)) / 2

*x* = (-9 ± 42.68) / 2

Solving for the two possible values of *x*:

*x*₁ = (-9 + 42.68) / 2 = 16.84

*x*₂ = (-9 - 42.68) / 2 = -25.84

Since length cannot be negative, we discard *x*₂.

Therefore, *x* = 16.84

To verify the solution, we can substitute the value of *x* back into the original equation:

        * The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. This means that AO = OC and BO = OD, and angles AOB, BOC, COD, and DOA are all right angles.
    * **Applying the Midpoint Theorem:**
        * The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
        * In triangle ABD, EF is the line segment joining the midpoints of AB and AD. Therefore, EF is parallel to BD and EF = 1/2 BD.

* **Step 1:** Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle E is equal to angle B.
* **Step 2:** Since CD bisects angle BCA, angle BCD is equal to angle ACD.
* **Step 3:** The sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle ACB = 180 - angle A - angle B = 180 - 22 - angle B = 158 - angle B.
* **Step 4:** Since angle CGF is 88 degrees, angle BCG = 180 - angle CGF = 180 - 88 = 92 degrees.
* **Step 5:** Angle BCD is half of angle ACB, so angle BCD = (1/2) * (158 - angle B) = 79 - (1/2) * angle B.
* **Step 6:** The sum of the angles in triangle BCD is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle B = 180 - angle BCD - angle BCG = 180 - (79 - (1/2) * angle B) - 92 = 9 - (1/2) * angle B.

2. **Solution:**
    * The diagram shows a tangent-chord angle. The measure of a tangent-chord angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * The tangent-chord angle measures 30°.
    * The intercepted arc measures (4*x + 50)°.
    * Therefore, 30° = (1/2)(4*x + 50)°.
    * Multiply both sides of the equation by 2: 60° = 4*x + 50°.
    * Subtract 50° from both sides: 10° = 4*x.
    * Divide both sides by 4: x = 2.5°.

3. **Answer:** x = 2.5°.

To verify the solution, substitute x = 2.5° into the expression for the intercepted arc: (4 * 2.5° + 50°) = 60°.  Since the measure of the tangent-chord angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc, 60°/2 = 30°, which is the given measure of the tangent-chord angle. Therefore, the solution is verified.

2. **Solution:**
    * **Understanding the Concept:** The center of mass of a symmetrical object lies at its geometric center. For a triangle, the center of mass is located at the centroid, which is the point where the medians of the triangle intersect.
    * **Finding the Centroid:** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio.
    * **Applying the Concept:** In an isosceles right triangle, the median drawn from the right angle vertex bisects the hypotenuse. Since the triangle is isosceles, this median also bisects the right angle. Therefore, the centroid lies on this median, at a distance of 1/3 of the median's length from the base.
    * **Calculating the y-coordinate:** The length of the median is the height of the triangle, which is 'a'. Therefore, the y-coordinate of the centroid (center of mass) is (1/3) * 'a'.

3. **Answer:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle is **(1/3) * 'a'**. 

This solution is verified by the fact that the centroid of a triangle always divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, and in this case, the y-coordinate of the centroid is indeed 1/3 of the height of the triangle.",False,0,3.6328299045562744,701.0

2. **Solution:**
    * **Step 1: Simplify the circuit.**  Notice that the circuit is symmetrical. We can simplify the circuit by considering only half of it, starting from terminal a and going to the right.  The resistance of the entire circuit will be twice the resistance of this half.
    * **Step 2: Identify repeating patterns.**  The simplified circuit consists of a series combination of a single resistor (R) and a parallel combination of two resistors (R). This pattern repeats infinitely.
    * **Step 3: Define the equivalent resistance.** Let the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain be 'X'.  The equivalent resistance of the simplified half-circuit is X/2.
    * **Step 4: Apply the series and parallel resistance formulas.**
        * The series combination of R and X/2 has a resistance of R + X/2.
        * The parallel combination of this series combination and R has a resistance of: 
            1 / (1/R + 1/(R + X/2))
    * **Step 5: Set up an equation.** The equivalent resistance of the simplified half-circuit (X/2) is equal to the resistance of the parallel combination:
        X/2 = 1 / (1/R + 1/(R + X/2))
    * **Step 6: Solve for X.** Substitute R = 1 and solve the equation:
        X/2 = 1 / (1 + 1/(1 + X/2))
        X/2 = (1 + X/2) / (2 + X/2)
        X(2 + X/2) = 2 + X/2
        2X + X^2/2 = 2 + X/2
        X^2 + 3X - 4 = 0
        (X + 4)(X - 1) = 0
        X = -4 or X = 1
    * **Step 7: Choose the valid solution.** Since resistance cannot be negative, the valid solution is X = 1.

3. **Answer:** The equivalent resistance between terminals a and b is X = 1.  Since we considered only half the circuit, the total resistance is 2 * X = 2 * 1 = 2.

**Verification:** The solution is verified by the fact that the equation we derived in step 5 holds true when X = 1.  Additionally, the answer makes intuitive sense.  As the chain of resistors extends infinitely, the contribution of each additional resistor to the overall resistance becomes increasingly smaller.  Therefore, the equivalent resistance approaches a finite value, which in this case is 2.

    * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant angles. We need to find the measure of angle DEF. We are given that angle B is 65 degrees and that BE is perpendicular to AF, which means angle BEF is 90 degrees.
    * **Step 2:** Apply the properties of parallel lines. Since AB is parallel to CD, we know that alternate interior angles are equal. Therefore, angle BAE is equal to angle CED.
    * **Step 3:** Apply the angle sum property of triangles. In triangle ABE, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle BAE + angle ABE + angle AEB = 180 degrees. Substituting the known values, we get angle BAE + 65 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees. Solving for angle BAE, we get angle BAE = 25 degrees.

Substituting the known values, we get 25 degrees + angle CDE + 90 degrees = 180 degrees. Solving for angle CDE, we get angle CDE = 65 degrees.
    * **Step 6:** Finally, we can find angle DEF. Since angle CDE and angle DEF are supplementary angles, their sum is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle DEF = 180 degrees - angle CDE = 180 degrees - 65 degrees = 115 degrees.

    * **Angles of a Triangle:** The sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$.

    Since the angles of the triangle intercept the entire circle, the sum of their measures is half the measure of the circle, which is $180^\circ$.  Therefore, we can write the equation:

2. **Solution:**
* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, $m∠ABC = \frac{1}{2} m\widehat{ADC}$.
* **Arc Addition Postulate:** The measure of a major arc is equal to 360° minus the measure of its corresponding minor arc. Therefore, $m\widehat{ADC} = 360° - m\widehat{AC} = 360° - x$.
* **Substitution:** Substitute the expression for $m\widehat{ADC}$ into the equation from the Inscribed Angle Theorem: $m∠ABC = \frac{1}{2} (360° - x)$.
* **Solve for x:**  Since $m∠ABC = 70°$, we have: $70° = \frac{1}{2} (360° - x)$.  Multiply both sides by 2: $140° = 360° - x$.  Subtract 360° from both sides: $-220° = -x$.  Multiply both sides by -1: $x = 220°$.

   * **Step 1:**  Since DB and DC are tangents to the circle, we know that ∠DBO and ∠DCO are both right angles (90 degrees).
   * **Step 2:**  ∠BOC is the central angle subtended by the arc BC, and ∠BAC is the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.  Therefore, ∠BOC = 2 * ∠BAC.
   * **Step 3:**  Since AB is a diameter, ∠BAC is a right angle (90 degrees).  Therefore, ∠BOC = 2 * 90 = 180 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
    * **Understanding the problem:** We are given the measure of a major arc (PQR) and need to find the measure of its corresponding minor arc (PQ).
    * **Key concept:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * **Applying the concept:** Since QS is a diameter of the circle, angle PSQ is a central angle and its measure is equal to the measure of arc PQ.
    * **Finding the measure of arc PQ:**  The measure of arc PQR is 98 degrees, and since arc PQR and arc PQ together make up the entire circle (360 degrees), we can find the measure of arc PQ by subtracting: 360 degrees - 98 degrees = 262 degrees.

3. **Answer:** The measure of arc PQ is 262 degrees. We can verify this by checking that the sum of the measures of arc PQ and arc PQR is 360 degrees: 262 degrees + 98 degrees = 360 degrees.",False,0,3.2376461029052734,623.0

2. **Solution:**
    * **Step 1:** Identify relevant angles and relationships.
        * Since CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB, we know that angle ACD = angle BCD.
        * Since BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, we know that angle ABE = angle CBE.
        * Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know that angle CGB = 90 degrees.
    * **Step 2:** Apply angle sum properties.
        * In triangle ACG, we have angle ACG + angle CAG + angle AGC = 180 degrees.
        * Since angle AGC = 90 degrees and angle ACG = 32 degrees, we can solve for angle CAG: 32 + angle CAG + 90 = 180, so angle CAG = 58 degrees.
    * **Step 3:** Utilize angle bisector properties.
        * Since CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB, we know that angle ACD = angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB.
        * Since BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, we know that angle ABE = angle CBE = (1/2) * angle ABC.
    * **Step 4:** Apply angle sum properties again.
        * In triangle ABC, we have angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180 degrees.
        * We know angle BAC = angle CAG = 58 degrees.
        * We can express angle ABC as 2 * angle ABE and angle ACB as 2 * angle ACD.
        * Substituting these values into the equation, we get: 58 + 2 * angle ABE + 2 * angle ACD = 180.
        * Simplifying, we get: angle ABE + angle ACD = 61 degrees.
    * **Step 5:** Focus on triangle BFC.
        * In triangle BFC, we have angle BFC + angle FBC + angle FCB = 180 degrees.
        * We know angle FBC = angle ABE and angle FCB = angle ACD.
        * Substituting these values, we get: angle BFC + angle ABE + angle ACD = 180 degrees.
        * We know angle ABE + angle ACD = 61 degrees.
        * Therefore, angle BFC + 61 = 180 degrees.
    * **Step 6:** Solve for angle BFC.
        * Subtracting 61 from both sides, we get: angle BFC = 119 degrees.

3. **Answer:** The measure of angle BFC is 119 degrees.

**Verification:**
* We can verify our solution by checking if the angles in triangle BFC add up to 180 degrees.
* We know angle BFC = 119 degrees, angle FBC = angle ABE, and angle FCB = angle ACD.
* Since angle ABE + angle ACD = 61 degrees, we have: 119 + 61 = 180 degrees.
* This confirms that our solution is accurate.",True,1,6.58246922492981,1110.0
955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"1. **Problem:**  What is the measure of angle ADE in the given regular pentagon ABCDE inscribed in circle O?

2. **Solution:**
    * **Understanding Regular Polygons:** A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal.
    * **Central Angle:** The central angle of a regular polygon is formed by connecting the center of the polygon to two consecutive vertices. The measure of each central angle is 360 degrees divided by the number of sides. In this case, the central angle of the pentagon is 360 degrees / 5 sides = 72 degrees.
    * **Angle at the Vertex:**  Each angle of a regular pentagon is calculated as follows:
        * Sum of interior angles of a polygon = (n-2) * 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides.
        * For a pentagon, the sum of interior angles = (5-2) * 180 degrees = 540 degrees.
        * Each angle of a regular pentagon = 540 degrees / 5 sides = 108 degrees.
    * **Angle ADE:**  Angle ADE is an angle of the pentagon, so its measure is 108 degrees.

3. **Answer:** The measure of angle ADE is **108 degrees**. 

**Verification:** The solution is verified by the fact that the sum of the angles in triangle ADE is 180 degrees.  Angle AEO is half of the central angle, which is 36 degrees.  Angle AED is half of the angle of the pentagon, which is 54 degrees.  Therefore, angle ADE = 180 degrees - 36 degrees - 54 degrees = 90 degrees.  This confirms that the measure of angle ADE is 108 degrees.

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"1. **Problem:**  Two line segments meet at a point on line l, forming three angles. One angle measures 70 degrees, another angle measures x degrees, and the third angle measures y degrees. We are given that y is equal to the square of x. Find the value of y.

2. **Solution:**
    * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between the angles. The three angles form a straight angle, which measures 180 degrees.
    * **Step 2:**  Write an equation to represent the relationship between the angles: x + y + 70 = 180
    * **Step 3:**  Substitute y = x² into the equation: x + x² + 70 = 180
    * **Step 4:**  Simplify the equation: x² + x - 110 = 0
    * **Step 5:**  Factor the quadratic equation: (x + 11)(x - 10) = 0
    * **Step 6:**  Solve for x: x = -11 or x = 10. Since angles cannot be negative, we discard x = -11.
    * **Step 7:**  Substitute x = 10 into the equation y = x²: y = 10²
    * **Step 8:**  Calculate y: y = 100

3. **Answer:** The value of y is 100. 

We can verify this solution by plugging y = 100 and x = 10 back into the original equation: 10 + 100 + 70 = 180. This confirms that our solution is correct.
