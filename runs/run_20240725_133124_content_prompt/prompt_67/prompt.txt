Imagine you are creating a detailed solution manual for a math textbook. Your goal is to make the solution to the math problem in the image crystal clear to anyone, even if they have never seen this type of problem before.

Here's how to structure your solution:

1. Problem:
   * What is the specific mathematical question we need to answer based on the image? 

2. Solution:
   * Break down the solution into a series of numbered steps.  
   * For each step:
      * Clearly describe the mathematical operation being performed (e.g., "Add the two numbers", "Apply the Pythagorean theorem").
      * Explain why this specific operation is needed at this step. Imagine you are explaining it to a friend who is learning this for the very first time. 
      * If a formula is used:
          * Write down the formula.
          * Explain what each part of the formula represents.
          * Show how to plug in the values from our problem into the formula.
          * Calculate the result and clearly box the answer for that step. 

3. Answer:
   *  What is the final answer to the problem, simplified as much as possible?
   * How can we double-check our answer to be 100% certain it is correct?
