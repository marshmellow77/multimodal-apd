643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem: 

In a circle with center O, CD is the diameter, chord DE is parallel to chord OA. If the measure of angle D is 50 degrees, find the measure of angle C. 

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**

   - Since CD is the diameter, angle COD is a straight angle, measuring 180 degrees.
   - DE || OA implies that angle D and angle A are corresponding angles and therefore congruent. So, angle A also measures 50 degrees.
   - Angle AOC is the central angle subtended by arc AC, and angle A is the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.  The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.

2. **Applying the Properties:**

   - Angle AOC = 2 * angle A = 2 * 50 degrees = 100 degrees.
   - Angle COD = 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, angle DOC = angle COD - angle AOC = 180 degrees - 100 degrees = 80 degrees.

3. **Finding Angle C:**

   - Angle C is part of triangle DOC.
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, angle C = 180 degrees - angle D - angle DOC = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 80 degrees = 50 degrees.

## Answer:

The degree of angle C is **50 degrees**.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"1. **Problem:** Find the length of the hypotenuse, $h$, of a right triangle with a leg of length 4 and an angle of 60 degrees.

2. **Solution:**

We can use the trigonometric function sine to solve for $h$.  Sine is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle.  In this case, the opposite side is the leg with length 4, and the hypotenuse is $h$.  Therefore, we have:

$$\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{4}{h}$$

We know that $\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.  Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

$$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{4}{h}$$

Solving for $h$, we get:

$$h = \frac{8}{\sqrt{3}}$$

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{3}$:

$$h = \frac{8}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \boxed{\frac{8\sqrt{3}}{3}}$$

Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse, $h$, is $\frac{8\sqrt{3}}{3}$.",False,0,3.6053879261016846,602.0

132,如图，在4×4的正方形网格中，每个小正方形的边长均为1，点A，B，C都在格点上，AD⊥BC于D，则AD的长为（）,2,"## Problem:

Find the length of line segment AD in the given diagram, where AD is perpendicular to BC, and the grid is a 4x4 square grid with each small square having a side length of 1. 

## Solution:

1. **Coordinate System:** Assign coordinates to points A, B, and C based on the grid. Let the bottom left corner of the grid be the origin (0,0).  Therefore:
    * A: (1, 4)
    * B: (0, 0)
    * C: (4, 2)

2. **Slope of BC:** Calculate the slope of line BC using the formula:
    * Slope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    * m(BC) = (2 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 1/2

3. **Slope of AD:** Since AD is perpendicular to BC, the product of their slopes is -1. Therefore:
    * m(AD) * m(BC) = -1
    * m(AD) * (1/2) = -1
    * m(AD) = -2

4. **Equation of AD:** Using the point-slope form of a linear equation, we can find the equation of line AD:
    * y - y1 = m(x - x1)
    * y - 4 = -2(x - 1)
    * y = -2x + 6

5. **Finding Point D:** Point D lies on both line AD and line BC. To find its coordinates, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the equations of these lines:
    * y = -2x + 6 (Equation of AD)
    * y = (1/2)x (Equation of BC)

    Substituting the second equation into the first equation:
    * (1/2)x = -2x + 6
    * (5/2)x = 6
    * x = 12/5

    Substituting the value of x back into the equation of BC:
    * y = (1/2) * (12/5) = 6/5

    Therefore, the coordinates of point D are (12/5, 6/5).

6. **Distance Formula:** Finally, we can use the distance formula to calculate the length of AD:
    * AD = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]
    * AD = √[(12/5 - 1)² + (6/5 - 4)²]
    * AD = √[(7/5)² + (-14/5)²]
    * AD = √(245/25)
    * AD = √(49/5)
    * AD = 7/√5

7. **Rationalizing the Denominator:** To simplify the answer, we can rationalize the denominator:
    * AD = (7/√5) * (√5/√5)
    * AD = 7√5 / 5

Therefore, the length of AD is **7√5 / 5**.

549,"As shown in the figure, PA and PB are tangent to ⊙O to A and B respectively. Point C and point D are the moving points on line segments PA and PB, and CD always remains tangent to circle O. If PA = 8.0, then perimeter of △PCD is ()",16,"## Problem:

In the given figure, PA and PB are tangents to circle O at points A and B respectively. Points C and D are moving points on line segments PA and PB, and CD is always tangent to circle O. If PA = 8.0, find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Properties:**

   - **Tangents from a point:**  PA and PB are tangents to the circle from point P. This means PA = PB (tangents from an external point to a circle are equal in length).
   - **Tangent-Radius Property:**  OA and OB are radii of the circle, and CD is a tangent. Therefore, OA ⊥ CD and OB ⊥ CD.

2. **Analyzing the Geometry:**

   - Since OA ⊥ CD and OB ⊥ CD, we can conclude that ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°.
   - Quadrilateral OACB has four right angles, making it a rectangle.
   - Since PA = PB, and OA = OB (radii), we can conclude that AC = BD (opposite sides of a rectangle are equal).

3. **Finding the Perimeter:**

   - Perimeter of △PCD = PC + CD + PD
   - PC = PA - AC = 8 - AC
   - PD = PB - BD = 8 - BD
   - Since AC = BD, we can simplify the perimeter:
     Perimeter of △PCD = (8 - AC) + CD + (8 - BD) = 16 + CD - (AC + BD)
   - Since AC = BD, the perimeter becomes:
     Perimeter of △PCD = 16 + CD - 2AC

4. **Key Observation:**

   - The length of CD is constant, regardless of the position of points C and D on PA and PB. This is because CD is always tangent to the circle, and the length of a tangent segment from a point to a circle is constant.

5. **Final Calculation:**

   - Since CD is constant and AC is a variable, the perimeter of △PCD is not fixed. It depends on the position of point C on PA.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for the perimeter of △PCD.

## Conclusion:

The perimeter of triangle PCD is not a fixed value and depends on the position of point C on line segment PA. We can express it as **16 + CD - 2AC**, where CD is a constant and AC is a variable.

In the given triangle ABC, AD is the median, and E is the midpoint of AD. If the area of triangle ABE is 2, find the area of triangle ABC. 

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Properties:**
   - A median of a triangle divides the triangle into two triangles with equal areas. Therefore, the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD.

Find the length of the missing side (x) of a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 15 and one leg of 9.

## Solution:

This problem can be solved using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b):

Let $x = JQ$.  Since $\overline{JQ}$ bisects $\angle J$, we have $\angle JQN = \angle JQP$.  Also, $\angle QNP = \angle QMP = 90^\circ$, so triangles $QNP$ and $QMP$ are similar.  Therefore,
\[\frac{QN}{QP} = \frac{MP}{NP}.\]Since $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$, we know that $QN = QP$.  Hence, $MP = NP$.

Let $y = MP = NP$.  Then by the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $MNP$, we have $y^2 + y^2 = 9^2$, so $2y^2 = 81$.  Then $y^2 = \frac{81}{2}$, so $y = \frac{9 \sqrt{2}}{2}$.

By the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $JNP$, we have $x^2 + y^2 = 16.5^2$.  Substituting $y = \frac{9 \sqrt{2}}{2}$, we get

82,A square is inscribed in a circle of area 18$\pi$ square units. Find the length of a side of the square.,6,"1. **Problem:** A square is inscribed in a circle of area 18$\pi$ square units. Find the length of a side of the square.

2. **Solution:**

* **Find the radius of the circle:** The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius. We are given that the area of the circle is $18\pi$ square units.  Substituting this into the formula, we get:
 $$18\pi = \pi r^2$$
 Dividing both sides by $\pi$, we get:
 $$18 = r^2$$
 Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
 $$r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$$

* **Relate the radius to the side of the square:**  The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.  The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is $2(3\sqrt{2}) = 6\sqrt{2}$.

* **Find the side of the square:** Let $s$ be the side length of the square.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have:
 $$s^2 + s^2 = (6\sqrt{2})^2$$
 Simplifying, we get:
 $$2s^2 = 72$$
 Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
 $$s^2 = 36$$
 Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
 $$s = 6$$

Therefore, the length of a side of the square is $\boxed{6}$ units.

In the given figure, AB∥CD, BC∥DE, ∠A=45°, ∠C=110°. Find the measure of ∠AED. 

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Properties:**

   - Since AB∥CD, we know that ∠A + ∠D = 180° (interior angles on the same side of the transversal).
   - Similarly, since BC∥DE, we know that ∠C + ∠E = 180°.

2. **Applying the Properties:**

   - We are given ∠A = 45° and ∠C = 110°.

In triangle ABC, N is the midpoint of BC, AM bisects angle BAC, and BM is perpendicular to AM at point M. If AB = 8 and MN = 2, find the length of AC. 

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a triangle ABC with a line segment AM bisecting angle BAC and another line segment BM perpendicular to AM. We are also given that N is the midpoint of BC and the lengths of AB and MN. We need to find the length of AC.

2. **Visualizing the Problem:**  Draw a diagram of the triangle ABC with all the given information. This will help us visualize the problem and identify relevant relationships.

3. **Applying Geometric Concepts:**

    * **Angle Bisector Theorem:** Since AM bisects angle BAC, we know that AB/AC = BM/MC.
    * **Pythagorean Theorem:** In right triangle BMN, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BM: BM² = BN² - MN².
    * **Midpoint Theorem:** Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know that BN = NC.

4. **Solving for AC:**

    * **Find BN:** Using the midpoint theorem, BN = NC = BC/2. Since we don't know BC, we need to find another way to express BN.
    * **Find BM:** Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle BMN, BM² = BN² - MN² = BN² - 2².
    * **Express BN in terms of AB and BM:**  From the angle bisector theorem, AB/AC = BM/MC. Since we don't know MC, we can express it as BC - BM. Substituting this into the angle bisector theorem, we get AB/(BC - BM) = BM/MC. Rearranging, we get AB * MC = BM * (BC - BM). Since MC = BC - BM, we can substitute and get AB * (BC - BM) = BM * (BC - BM). Simplifying, we get AB = BM.
    * **Solve for BN:** Now we know that AB = BM = 8. Substituting this into the equation for BM², we get 8² = BN² - 2². Solving for BN, we get BN = √(8² + 2²) = √68 = 2√17.
    * **Find AC:** Since BN = NC, we know that BC = 2 * BN = 4√17. Using the angle bisector theorem, AB/AC = BM/MC. Substituting the values we know, we get 8/AC = 8/(4√17 - 8). Solving for AC, we get AC = 4√17 - 8.

In right triangle ABC, ∠ACB = 90°, D is the midpoint of AB, and AB = 10. Find the length of CD. 

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a right triangle with a midpoint on the hypotenuse. We need to find the length of the line segment connecting the midpoint to the right angle vertex.

2. **Applying the Midpoint Theorem:** The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

3. **Applying the Theorem to our Problem:** Since D is the midpoint of AB, CD is parallel to BC and half the length of BC.

4. **Finding BC:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BC:  
   AB² = AC² + BC²
   10² = AC² + BC²
   Since we don't know AC, we can't directly solve for BC.

5. **Using Similar Triangles:**  Triangles ACD and ABC are similar because they share angle A and have parallel sides (CD || BC).  Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal:

    * **Angles in a triangle:** The sum of angles in any triangle is 180°.

* **Steps:**
    1. **Triangle PAB:** Since PA = PB, triangle PAB is an isosceles triangle. Therefore, ∠PAB = ∠PBA.
    2. **Angles in triangle PAB:**  We know ∠P = 50°.  Using the angle sum property of triangles, we can find ∠PAB and ∠PBA:
        ∠PAB + ∠PBA + ∠P = 180°

2. **Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to understand the Triangle Inequality Theorem. This theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.

Let's analyze the possible perimeters:

* **If the perimeter is 18:** The third side would be 18 - 7 - 12 = -1. This is impossible, as a side length cannot be negative.

* **If the perimeter is 19:** The third side would be 19 - 7 - 12 = 0. This is also impossible, as a side length cannot be zero.

* **If the perimeter is 20:** The third side would be 20 - 7 - 12 = 1. This is possible, as it satisfies the Triangle Inequality Theorem.

* **If the perimeter is 21:** The third side would be 21 - 7 - 12 = 2. This is possible, as it satisfies the Triangle Inequality Theorem.

* **If the perimeter is 22:** The third side would be 22 - 7 - 12 = 3. This is possible, as it satisfies the Triangle Inequality Theorem.

Therefore, the perimeter that cannot be the perimeter of the triangle is **18**.

2. **Solution:**

* **Angle Bisector Theorem:** The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that an angle bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.

* **Applying the Theorem:**
    * Let's denote the point where OB intersects AC as D and the point where OC intersects AB as E.
    * Applying the angle bisector theorem to triangle ABC, we have:
        * BD/DC = AB/AC
        * AE/EB = AC/AB

* **Combining the Ratios:**
    * Multiplying the two equations above, we get:
        * (BD/DC) * (AE/EB) = (AB/AC) * (AC/AB) = 1
        * This simplifies to: BD * AE = DC * EB

* **Angle BOC:**
    * In triangle BOC, we have:
        * ∠BOC = 180° - ∠OBC - ∠OCB
    * Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, we have:
        * ∠OBC = 1/2 * ∠ABC
        * ∠OCB = 1/2 * ∠ACB
    * Therefore:
        * ∠BOC = 180° - (1/2 * ∠ABC) - (1/2 * ∠ACB)
        * ∠BOC = 180° - 1/2 * (∠ABC + ∠ACB)

* **Using the Angle Sum Property:**
    * In triangle ABC, we know that:
        * ∠A + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°
        * Therefore: ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180° - ∠A = 180° - 110° = 70°

* **Final Calculation:**
    * Substituting the value of ∠ABC + ∠ACB into the equation for ∠BOC, we get:
        * ∠BOC = 180° - 1/2 * 70° = 180° - 35° = 145°

Given that lines a and b are parallel, and triangle ABC is a right triangle with ∠C = 90° and ∠B = 58°, find the value of ∠1 - ∠2. 

## Solution:

1. **Identify key angles:** We are given that ∠B = 58° and ∠C = 90°. Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, we can find ∠A: ∠A = 180° - ∠B - ∠C = 180° - 58° - 90° = 32°.

In quadrilateral ABCD, ∠BAD = 120°, ∠B = ∠D = 90°. Points M and N are on BC and CD respectively, such that the perimeter of △AMN is minimized. Find the degree measure of ∠AMN + ∠ANM.

## Solution:

1. **Geometric Analysis:**

   - Since ∠B = ∠D = 90°, we know that ABCD is a right trapezoid.
   - Let's draw perpendiculars from A to BC and CD, intersecting at points E and F respectively.
   - Now, we have two right triangles: △ABE and △ADF.
   - Since ∠BAD = 120°, we know that ∠BAE = ∠DAF = 60°.
   - Therefore, △ABE and △ADF are 30-60-90 triangles.

2. **Minimizing Perimeter:**

   - The perimeter of △AMN is AM + MN + AN.
   - To minimize the perimeter, we need to minimize each of these segments.
   - Notice that AM is the hypotenuse of △AME, and AN is the hypotenuse of △ANF.
   - The hypotenuse of a right triangle is always the longest side.
   - Therefore, to minimize AM and AN, we need to minimize AE and AF respectively.

3. **Finding Optimal Positions:**

   - Since △ABE and △ADF are 30-60-90 triangles, we know that AE = AB/2 and AF = AD/2.
   - To minimize AE and AF, we need to minimize AB and AD respectively.
   - This means that points M and N should coincide with points B and D respectively.

4. **Calculating Angles:**

   - When M coincides with B and N coincides with D, △AMN becomes △ABD.
   - ∠AMN = ∠ABD = 90° and ∠ANM = ∠ADB = 90°.
   - Therefore, ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 90° + 90° = 180°.

2. **Solution:**

The diagram shows a transversal intersecting two parallel lines. The angles marked with pink lines are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

20 - 5x = -y

Similarly, the angles marked with pink lines on the bottom two lines are also corresponding angles. So, we can set up another equation:

2x + 6 = -3/5y + 2

Now we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for y by using substitution or elimination.

**Using substitution:**

From the first equation, we can solve for x:

x = (20 + y)/5

Substituting this value of x into the second equation, we get:

2[(20 + y)/5] + 6 = -3/5y + 2

Simplifying the equation:

8 + 2/5y + 6 = -3/5y + 2

Combining like terms:

Given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees, find the measure of angle E. 

## Solution:

1. **Congruent Triangles:** Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, we know that corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle E is equal to angle B.

2. **Angle Bisector:** CD bisects angle BCA, meaning angle BCD is equal to angle ACD.

3. **Angle Sum Property:** The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Applying this to triangle ABC, we have:
    angle A + angle B + angle C = 180 degrees
    22 degrees + angle B + angle C = 180 degrees
    angle B + angle C = 158 degrees

4. **Angle Relationships:**  We can see that angle CGF is an exterior angle of triangle BCD. Therefore, angle CGF is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles:
    angle CGF = angle BCD + angle CBD
    88 degrees = angle BCD + angle CBD

5. **Solving for Angle B:** Since angle BCD is equal to angle ACD, we can rewrite the equation from step 4 as:
    88 degrees = angle ACD + angle CBD
    88 degrees = (1/2) * angle C + angle CBD

6. **Substituting and Solving:** Substituting the value of angle C from step 3 into the equation from step 5, we get:
    88 degrees = (1/2) * (158 degrees - angle B) + angle CBD
    88 degrees = 79 degrees - (1/2) * angle B + angle CBD
    9 degrees = (1/2) * angle B - angle CBD

7. **Finding Angle B:** Since angle B is equal to angle E, we can solve for angle B:
    9 degrees = (1/2) * angle B - angle CBD
    9 degrees = (1/2) * angle B - (angle B - angle BCD)
    9 degrees = (1/2) * angle B - angle B + angle BCD
    9 degrees = -(1/2) * angle B + angle BCD

    * Since $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$, we know that arc $CH$ is congruent to arc $KJ$.
    * Let's call the measure of arc $CH$ (and arc $KJ$)  $y$.
    * The inscribed angle $\angle GJH$ intercepts arc $CH$, so by the Inscribed Angle Theorem,  $m\angle GJH = \frac{1}{2}y$.
    * Similarly, the inscribed angle $\angle KGH$ intercepts arc $KJ$, so $m\angle KGH = \frac{1}{2}y$.

* **Setting up the Equation:**
    * We know that the angles $\angle GJH$ and $\angle KGH$ form a linear pair (they add up to 180 degrees).
    * Therefore, we can write the equation:  $m\angle GJH + m\angle KGH = 180^\circ$

* **Solving for x:**
    * We know that $m\angle KJH = 2x - 27^\circ$ and it intercepts arc $KJ$ (which has a measure of $y = 180^\circ$).
    * Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem:  $2x - 27^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ)$

   * **Symmetry:** The circuit exhibits symmetry. If we remove the first section of the chain (the three resistors on the left), the remaining circuit is identical to the original one.

   * **Equivalent Resistance:** Let the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain be 'Req'.  Since the circuit is symmetrical, the resistance between point 'a' and the junction point between the first two resistors is also 'Req'.

      * The parallel combination of R and R has an equivalent resistance of R/2 (1/2 in this case).
      * This equivalent resistance is in series with another R (1 in this case).

Find the value of x in the given regular hexagon ABCDEF, where O is the center of the hexagon and angle ABO is x degrees.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Regular Hexagons:** A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles. The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is 720 degrees. Therefore, each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures 720/6 = 120 degrees.

2. **Angles at the Center:** Since O is the center of the hexagon, lines OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, and OF are all radii of the hexagon. This means that triangles ABO, BCO, CDO, DEO, EFO, and FAO are all isosceles triangles.

3. **Angle Calculation:**  
    * Angle AOB is one-sixth of the total angle around point O, which is 360 degrees. Therefore, angle AOB = 360/6 = 60 degrees.

2. **Solution:**

The diagram shows a cyclic quadrilateral $CDE$, where $C$, $D$, and $E$ lie on the circle.  By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, $\angle DCE = \frac{1}{2} \angle COE$ and $\angle DEC = \frac{1}{2} \angle DOC$.  Since $\angle COE$ and $\angle DOC$ are supplementary angles, we have $\angle DCE + \angle DEC = \frac{1}{2} (\angle COE + \angle DOC) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 180^\circ = 90^\circ$.

Thus, $\angle DCE + \angle DEC = 90^\circ$, so $(5x - 12)^\circ + 3x^\circ = 90^\circ$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x = \boxed{13}$.",False,0,2.954577922821045,538.0

2. **Solution:**

* **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a diagram with a triangle and a line intersecting it. We need to find the measure of a specific angle within the triangle. The given information suggests that we need to use the concept of similar triangles and angle relationships.

* **Identifying Similar Triangles:**  The given ratio $\frac{IJ}{XJ}=\frac{HJ}{YJ}$ indicates that triangles $HIJ$ and $XYJ$ are similar. This is because the ratio of corresponding sides is equal.

* **Angle Relationships:**
    * Since $\angle WXJ$ and $\angle JXZ$ are supplementary angles, we have $m\angle JXZ = 180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ$.
    * Since $\angle WZG$ and $\angle GZY$ are supplementary angles, we have $m\angle GZY = 180^\circ - 20^\circ = 160^\circ$.
    * Since $\angle GZY$ and $\angle JYZ$ are vertical angles, we have $m\angle JYZ = 160^\circ$.

* **Finding the Missing Angle:**
    * Since triangles $HIJ$ and $XYJ$ are similar, we know that corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, $m\angle YIZ = m\angle JYZ - m\angle JXY = 160^\circ - 50^\circ = 110^\circ$.

If $m∠ABC = 70°$, find $x$.

2. **Solution:**

* **Understanding the Relationship:**  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, ∠ABC intercepts arc ADC. Therefore, we have:

   *  $m∠ABC = \frac{1}{2} m\widehat{ADC}$

* **Substituting Values:** We are given that $m∠ABC = 70°$ and $m\widehat{ADC} = y$. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the key features:** The parallelogram has a base of 23 ft and a side length of 16 ft. We also know that the angle between the base and the side is 60 degrees.

2. **Utilize trigonometric relationships:** Since we have a right triangle formed by the height, the base, and the side of the parallelogram, we can use trigonometry to find the height. 

   *  We know that the cosine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse. In this case, cos(60°) = height / 16 ft.
   *  cos(60°) = 1/2, so (1/2) = height / 16 ft.
   *  Solving for the height, we get height = 8 ft.

2. **Solution:**

* **Understanding the Geometry:** The diagram shows a circle with two secants intersecting outside the circle. We can use the Secant-Secant Theorem to solve for x.

* **Secant-Secant Theorem:** The theorem states that when two secants intersect outside a circle, the product of the external segment of one secant and its whole length is equal to the product of the external segment of the other secant and its whole length.

* **Applying the Theorem:**
    * Let's call the external segment of the secant with length 15 as 'a' (a = 15).
    * The whole length of this secant is 'a + 12' (15 + 12 = 27).
    * The external segment of the secant with length x is 'x'.
    * The whole length of this secant is 'x + 8'.

* **Setting up the Equation:** According to the Secant-Secant Theorem:
    * a(a + 12) = x(x + 8)

* **Solving for x:**
    * 15(15 + 12) = x(x + 8)
    * 15(27) = x² + 8x
    * 405 = x² + 8x
    * 0 = x² + 8x - 405
    * Using the quadratic formula to solve for x:
        * x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
        * Where a = 1, b = 8, and c = -405
        * x = (-8 ± √(8² - 4 * 1 * -405)) / 2 * 1
        * x = (-8 ± √(1684)) / 2
        * x = (-8 ± 41.05) / 2

* **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a circle with a central angle that intercepts a major arc (PQR) and a minor arc (PQ). We need to find the measure of the minor arc.

* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Central Angle Theorem:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * **Arc Addition Postulate:** The measure of a major arc is equal to 360 degrees minus the measure of its corresponding minor arc.

* **Applying the Concepts:**
    1. Since angle QSP is a central angle intercepting arc PQR, we know that  m∠QSP = m arc PQR = 98 degrees.
    2.  We can use the Arc Addition Postulate to find the measure of arc PQ: m arc PQR = m arc PQ + m arc QR.

Find the measure of angle ADE in the given diagram, where O is the center of a regular pentagon ABCDE and circle O is the circumcircle of the pentagon. 

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Properties:**

   - A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles.
   - The sum of interior angles of a pentagon is (5-2) * 180° = 540°.
   - Therefore, each interior angle of a regular pentagon measures 540°/5 = 108°.
   - The center of a regular pentagon is equidistant from all vertices.
   - The center of a regular pentagon divides each central angle into equal parts.

2. **Applying the Properties:**

   - Since ABCDE is a regular pentagon, ∠ABC = 108°.
   - Since O is the center of the pentagon, OA = OB = OC = OD = OE.
   - Therefore, triangles OAB, OBC, OCD, ODE, and OEA are all isosceles triangles.
   - Since O is the center of the circumcircle, ∠AOB = ∠BOC = ∠COD = ∠DOE = ∠EOA = 360°/5 = 72°.
   - In isosceles triangle OAB, ∠OAB = ∠OBA = (180° - ∠AOB)/2 = (180° - 72°)/2 = 54°.
