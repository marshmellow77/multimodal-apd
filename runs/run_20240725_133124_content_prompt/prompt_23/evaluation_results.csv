* We are given that ∠D = 50°.
* We know that CD is a diameter of the circle, so ∠COD = 180°.

We are given a circle with center O, and two tangents PA and PB drawn from an external point P. Points C and D move along PA and PB respectively, while maintaining CD as a tangent to the circle. We need to find the perimeter of triangle PCD when PA = 8.

**Step 2: Identify key properties**

* **Tangents from a point:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.
* **Tangent-radius property:** A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of contact. Therefore, OA ⊥ AC and OB ⊥ BD.

* Since OA ⊥ AC and OB ⊥ BD, we have right-angled triangles OAC and OBD.
* In triangle OAC, OA is the radius of the circle and AC is a part of the tangent PA. Similarly, in triangle OBD, OB is the radius and BD is a part of the tangent PB.

Since CD bisects angle ACB, we have:

∠ACD = ∠BCD = ∠ACB / 2

We know that ∠DBC = 54°. Since BD is perpendicular to CD, we have:

∠BDC = 90°

Therefore, in triangle BCD, we can find angle ACB:

∠ACB = ∠BCD + ∠BDC = ∠DBC + ∠BDC = 54° + 90° = 144°

We are given a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of AB that intersects AB at point D and BC at point E. We are also given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13. We need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

**Step 2: Use the properties of perpendicular bisectors**

Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 3.

**Step 3: Use the perimeter information**

The perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, which means AC + CE + AE = 13.

**Step 4: Find the length of AC**

Since AD = DB = 3, we know that AC = AD + DC = 3 + DC.

**Step 5: Find the length of CE**

Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that CE = BE.

**Step 2: Use the angle bisector theorem.**

The angle bisector theorem states that if a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.

In triangle ABC, BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC. Therefore, by the angle bisector theorem, we have:

```
AE/EC = AB/BC
```

In triangle BCD, CF is the angle bisector of angle BCD. Therefore, by the angle bisector theorem, we have:

```
DF/FB = DC/BC
```

**Step 3: Use the fact that ABCD is a parallelogram.**

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, we know that AB = CD and BC = AD. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the equations from Step 2:

```
AE/EC = AB/AD = 3/4
DF/FB = DC/AD = 3/4
```

**Step 4: Solve for AE, EC, DF, and FB.**

Let AE = 3x and EC = 4x. Then, we have:

```
AE + EC = AD = 4
3x + 4x = 4
7x = 4
x = 4/7

Therefore, AE = 3x = 12/7 and EC = 4x = 16/7.

DF + FB = AD = 4
3y + 4y = 4

We are given that the area of the circle is $18\pi$ square units, so we can set up the equation $18\pi = \pi r^2$.

* We are given that ∠ADC = 26°.
* We know that AB is a diameter, so ∠ACB is a right angle (90°).
* We need to find ∠CAB.

**Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

* The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* In this case, ∠ADC intercepts arc AC.  Therefore, the measure of arc AC is 2 * ∠ADC = 2 * 26° = 52°.

**Step 3: Apply the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.**

* A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle and whose sides pass through two points on the circle.
* An inscribed angle is an angle whose vertex is on the circle and whose sides pass through two points on the circle.
* The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
* Since ∠ACB is a central angle intercepting arc AC, its measure is 2 * 52° = 104°.

**Step 4: Use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°.**

* In triangle ABC, we have:
    * ∠CAB + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°
* We know ∠ACB = 90° and ∠ABC = 104° (from Step 3).

**Final Answer:** The degree of ∠CAB is **-14°**. However, angles are typically measured between 0° and 360°.  Since the angle is negative, it means that the angle is measured clockwise from the positive x-axis.  To get the equivalent positive angle, we can add 360°: -14° + 360° = **346°**.

We are given that ∠A = 45° and ∠C = 110°. We need to find ∠AED.

**Step 2: Use the properties of parallel lines**

Since AB∥CD, we know that ∠A + ∠D = 180° (interior angles on the same side of the transversal). Therefore, ∠D = 180° - 45° = 135°.

Similarly, since BC∥DE, we know that ∠C + ∠E = 180° (interior angles on the same side of the transversal). Therefore, ∠E = 180° - 110° = 70°.

We are given a triangle ABC with a point D on side BC. We know the lengths of BD and DC, and the area of triangle ACD. We need to find the area of triangle ABC.

**Step 2: Use the ratio of areas**

Since D divides BC into two segments, we can use the ratio of areas to find the area of triangle ABC.

The ratio of the areas of two triangles with the same height is equal to the ratio of their bases.

**Step 2: Use the given information to find the length of BM.**

Since BM is perpendicular to AM, we have a right triangle ABM. We know that AB = 8 and MN = 2. Since N is the midpoint of BC, we have BN = NC = BC/2. Therefore, BM = BN - MN = BC/2 - 2.

**Step 3: Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of AM.**

In right triangle ABM, we have:

```
AM^2 = AB^2 - BM^2
```

Substituting the values we know, we get:

```
AM^2 = 8^2 - (BC/2 - 2)^2

**Step 4: Use the Angle Bisector Theorem to find the ratio of AC to BC.**

Since AM bisects angle BAC, we have:

```
AB/AC = BM/MC
```

Substituting the values we know, we get:

```
8/AC = (BC/2 - 2)/MC
```

**Step 5: Solve for AC.**

We have two equations with two unknowns (AC and BC). We can solve for AC by substituting the expression for BC/2 - 2 from the Pythagorean Theorem into the Angle Bisector Theorem equation. This gives us:

```
8/AC = (8^2 - AM^2)/MC
```

We can then solve for AC in terms of AM and MC. Finally, we can substitute the value of AM from the Pythagorean Theorem to get the final answer.

**Solution:**

```
AM^2 = 8^2 - (BC/2 - 2)^2
AM^2 = 64 - (BC^2/4 - 2BC + 4)
AM^2 = 60 - BC^2/4 + 2BC

8/AC = (8^2 - AM^2)/MC
8/AC = (64 - (60 - BC^2/4 + 2BC))/MC
8/AC = (4 + BC^2/4 - 2BC)/MC

AC = 8MC/(4 + BC^2/4 - 2BC)

AM^2 = 60 - BC^2/4 + 2BC
AM = sqrt(60 - BC^2/4 + 2BC)

AC = 8MC/(4 + BC^2/4 - 2BC)
AC = 8MC/(4 + (sqrt(60 - BC^2/4 + 2BC))^2/4 - 2BC)
AC = 8MC/(4 + (60 - BC^2/4 + 2BC)/4 - 2BC)

3,△ABC的两内角平分线OB、OC相交于点O，若∠A＝110°，则∠BOC＝（）,145°,"**Step 1: Understand the problem**

We are given a triangle ABC with two internal angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. We know that angle A is 110 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle BOC.

**Step 2: Apply the angle bisector theorem**

The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.

In our case, OB bisects angle ABC, so we have:

```
AB/BC = AO/CO
```

Similarly, OC bisects angle ACB, so we have:

```
AC/BC = AO/BO
```

**Step 3: Use the angle sum property of triangles**

The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.

Applying this to triangle ABC, we have:

```
∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
```

Substituting ∠A = 110°, we get:

```
110° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
```

```
∠B + ∠C = 70°
```

**Step 4: Find the measure of angle BOC**

Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, we have:

```
∠ABO = ∠CBO = ∠B/2
```

```
∠ACO = ∠BCO = ∠C/2
```

Now, consider triangle BOC. The sum of its interior angles is 180 degrees:

```
∠BOC + ∠BCO + ∠CBO = 180°
```

Substituting the values we found:

```
∠BOC + ∠C/2 + ∠B/2 = 180°
```

```
∠BOC + (∠B + ∠C)/2 = 180°
```

```
∠BOC + 70°/2 = 180°

∠BOC = 180° - 35°

Draw a diagram of the quadrilateral ABCD with points M and N on BC and CD respectively.

**Step 2: Use the Law of Cosines**

In triangle AMB, we have:

AM^2 = AB^2 + BM^2 - 2 * AB * BM * cos(∠ABM)
```

In triangle AND, we have:

```
AN^2 = AD^2 + DN^2 - 2 * AD * DN * cos(∠ADN)
```

**Step 3: Minimize the perimeter**

The perimeter of triangle AMN is:

```
AM + MN + AN
```

To minimize the perimeter, we need to minimize AM + AN.

**Step 4: Use the Triangle Inequality**

The Triangle Inequality states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.

Applying this to triangles AMB and AND, we get:

```
AM + BM > AB
AN + DN > AD
```

**Step 5: Substitute and simplify**

Substituting the expressions for AM^2 and AN^2 from Step 2 into the inequalities from Step 4, we get:

```
√(AB^2 + BM^2 - 2 * AB * BM * cos(∠ABM)) + BM > AB
√(AD^2 + DN^2 - 2 * AD * DN * cos(∠ADN)) + DN > AD

Simplifying these inequalities, we get:

```
√(AB^2 + BM^2 - 2 * AB * BM * cos(∠ABM)) > AB - BM
√(AD^2 + DN^2 - 2 * AD * DN * cos(∠ADN)) > AD - DN
```

**Step 6: Minimize the expressions**

To minimize the expressions on the left-hand side of the inequalities, we need to minimize the values of BM and DN.

Since BM and DN are lengths, they cannot be negative. Therefore, the minimum values of BM and DN are 0.

**Step 7: Find the angles**

When BM = 0, point M coincides with point B. Similarly, when DN = 0, point N coincides with point D.

Therefore, ∠AMN = ∠AMB and ∠ANM = ∠AND.

Since ∠BAD = 120° and ∠B = ∠D = 90°, we have:

```
∠AMB = 180° - ∠BAD - ∠B = 180° - 120° - 90° = -30°
∠AND = 180° - ∠BAD - ∠D = 180° - 120° - 90° = -30°

**Step 8: Calculate the sum of the angles**

Therefore, ∠AMN + ∠ANM = ∠AMB + ∠AND = -30° + (-30°) = -60°.

**Step 9: Convert to degrees**

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, we have:

```
∠AMN + ∠ANM + ∠MAN = 180°

Substituting ∠AMN + ∠ANM = -60°, we get:

-60° + ∠MAN = 180°

Solving for ∠MAN, we get:

∠MAN = 240°
