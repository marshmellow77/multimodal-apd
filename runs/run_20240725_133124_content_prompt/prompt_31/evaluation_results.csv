643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand the Properties**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Parallel Lines:** When parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.

**2. Apply the Properties**

* **Angle D:** Since CD is a diameter, ∠D intercepts a semicircle, which has a measure of 180°.  Therefore, ∠D = 1/2 * 180° = 90°.
* **Angle AOD:**  Since ∠D = 90°, and ∠D and ∠AOD are supplementary angles, ∠AOD = 180° - 90° = 90°.
* **Angle AOE:**  Because DE || OA, ∠AOE and ∠DEO are corresponding angles and therefore equal.  So, ∠AOE = ∠DEO = 50°.
* **Angle AOC:**  Since ∠AOD = 90° and ∠AOE = 50°, ∠AOC = 90° + 50° = 140°.
* **Angle C:**  ∠C intercepts the same arc as ∠AOC, so ∠C = 1/2 * ∠AOC = 1/2 * 140° = 70°.

**Therefore, the degree of ∠C is 70°.**

What is the $x$ component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3?",0.17,"The problem asks for the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.  To solve this, we need to consider the forces exerted on particle 3 by each of the other particles.

**1. Forces due to charges 1 and 2:**

* **Force due to charge 1:**  The force between charges 1 and 3 is attractive (opposite charges) and acts along the diagonal of the square.  We can resolve this force into its x and y components. The x-component of this force will be directed towards the right.
* **Force due to charge 2:** The force between charges 2 and 3 is repulsive (same charges) and acts along the horizontal line connecting them. This force is entirely in the x-direction and is directed towards the left.

**2. Force due to charge 4:**

* **Force due to charge 4:** The force between charges 4 and 3 is repulsive (same charges) and acts along the vertical line connecting them. This force has no x-component.

**3. Calculating the x-component of the net force:**

* **Force due to charge 1:**  The x-component of the force due to charge 1 can be calculated using trigonometry. The angle between the diagonal and the horizontal is 45 degrees. Therefore, the x-component of the force due to charge 1 is (Force due to charge 1) * cos(45 degrees).
* **Force due to charge 2:** This force is entirely in the x-direction.
* **Force due to charge 4:** This force has no x-component.

**4. Adding the x-components:**

The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of the forces due to charges 1 and 2.

**5. Using Coulomb's Law:**

To calculate the magnitudes of the forces, we need to use Coulomb's Law:

F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2

where:

* F is the force between two charges
* k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2)
* q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges
* r is the distance between the charges

**6. Plugging in the values:**

* Calculate the forces due to charges 1, 2, and 4 using Coulomb's Law.
* Calculate the x-component of the force due to charge 1.
* Add the x-components of the forces due to charges 1 and 2 to find the net x-component of the force on particle 3.

**Note:** The direction of the net force will depend on the relative magnitudes of the forces due to charges 1 and 2. If the force due to charge 1 is greater than the force due to charge 2, the net force will be directed towards the right. If the force due to charge 2 is greater than the force due to charge 1, the net force will be directed towards the left.

   - Count the grid squares to find the lengths of AB and BC.  AB has a length of 4 units, and BC has a length of 3 units.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In this case, AB is the hypotenuse, and AD and BD are the other two sides.

549,"As shown in the figure, PA and PB are tangent to ⊙O to A and B respectively. Point C and point D are the moving points on line segments PA and PB, and CD always remains tangent to circle O. If PA = 8.0, then perimeter of △PCD is ()",16,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding the Geometry**

* **Tangents and Radii:**  When a line is tangent to a circle, it forms a right angle with the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OAC and ∠OBD are right angles.
* **Congruent Tangents:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are congruent. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.
* **Similar Triangles:**  Triangles OAC and OBD are similar because they share two congruent angles (∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90° and ∠COA = ∠DOB).

**Solving the Problem**

1. **Find OC and OD:** Since ∠OAC and ∠OBD are right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Let the radius of the circle be r.  
   * In triangle OAC:  OC² = OA² + AC² = r² + AC²
   * In triangle OBD:  OD² = OB² + BD² = r² + BD²

2. **Use Similar Triangles:**  Because triangles OAC and OBD are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal:
   * AC/BD = OC/OD

3. **Express the Perimeter of △PCD:**
   * Perimeter of △PCD = PC + CD + PD = (PA - AC) + CD + (PB - BD) = 8 - AC + CD + 8 - BD = 16 - (AC + BD) + CD

4. **Substitute and Simplify:**
   * From the similar triangles, we know AC/BD = OC/OD.  Let's substitute OC² and OD² from step 1:
      * AC/BD = √(r² + AC²)/√(r² + BD²)
   * Square both sides: AC²/BD² = (r² + AC²)/(r² + BD²)
   * Cross-multiply and simplify: AC²(r² + BD²) = BD²(r² + AC²)
   * Expand: AC²r² + AC²BD² = BD²r² + BD²AC²
   * Cancel out AC²BD² and BD²AC²: AC²r² = BD²r²
   * Divide both sides by r²: AC² = BD²
   * Take the square root of both sides: AC = BD

5. **Final Calculation:**
   * Substitute AC = BD into the perimeter equation from step 3:
      * Perimeter of △PCD = 16 - (AC + BD) + CD = 16 - 2AC + CD
   * Since CD is a tangent to the circle, it's perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.  Therefore, CD is the shortest distance between point C and point D, making it the shortest possible length for the third side of △PCD. 
   * The perimeter of △PCD will be minimized when CD is as small as possible.  This occurs when C and D are very close to A and B, respectively.  In this case, AC and BD are very small, and the perimeter of △PCD is approximately 16.

**Therefore, the perimeter of △PCD is approximately 16.**

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem asks us to find a point M on line BC and a point N on line CD such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized.  This is a classic optimization problem.

**Key Concepts**

* **Reflection:**  The key to solving this problem is to use the concept of reflection.  We'll reflect point A across line BC to create a new point A'.
* **Shortest Distance:** The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

**Solution**

1. **Reflect Point A:** Reflect point A across line BC to create point A'.  Notice that triangle ABA' is isosceles with AB = A'B.

2. **Connect A' and N:** Draw a line segment from A' to point N.

3. **Perimeter Minimization:**  The perimeter of triangle AMN is AM + MN + NA.  Since AB = A'B, we can rewrite this as:

   AM + MN + NA = A'M + MN + NA

   Notice that A'M + MN + NA represents the path from A' to N.  The shortest path from A' to N is a straight line.

4. **Angle Calculation:** Since A'N is a straight line, ∠A'MN + ∠ANM = 180°.  Since triangle ABA' is isosceles, ∠A'MB = ∠AMB.  Therefore:

   ∠AMN + ∠ANM = ∠AMB + ∠ANM = 180° - ∠A'MB = 180° - ∠AMB

5. **Finding ∠AMB:**  Since ∠BAD = 120° and ∠B = 90°, we have ∠ABD = 180° - 120° - 90° = -30°.  However, angles cannot be negative, so ∠ABD = 360° - 30° = 330°.  Therefore, ∠AMB = 180° - ∠ABD = 180° - 330° = -150°.  Again, angles cannot be negative, so ∠AMB = 360° - 150° = 210°.

6. **Final Calculation:**  ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 180° - ∠AMB = 180° - 210° = -30°.  Since angles cannot be negative, ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 360° - 30° = **330°**.

The problem asks for the measure of angle E in triangle DEF, given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees.

**2. Use congruence properties:**

Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle D = angle A = 22 degrees.

**3. Use angle bisector properties:**

CD bisects angle BCA, meaning angle BCD = angle ACD. Since angle A = 22 degrees, angle BCD = angle ACD = 22/2 = 11 degrees.

**4. Use angle relationships:**

Angle CGF is an exterior angle of triangle CDB. The measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, angle CGF = angle BCD + angle CBD.

**5. Solve for angle CBD:**

We know angle CGF = 88 degrees and angle BCD = 11 degrees. Substituting these values into the equation from step 4, we get 88 = 11 + angle CBD. Solving for angle CBD, we find angle CBD = 77 degrees.

**6. Use angle relationships again:**

Angle CBD is an exterior angle of triangle DEF. Therefore, angle CBD = angle D + angle E.

**7. Solve for angle E:**

We know angle CBD = 77 degrees and angle D = 22 degrees. Substituting these values into the equation from step 6, we get 77 = 22 + angle E. Solving for angle E, we find angle E = 55 degrees.

**Understanding the Circuit**

The circuit is a repeating pattern of resistors.  This type of circuit is called an infinite ladder network.

**The Key Insight**

The trick is to realize that the resistance between points a and b is the same as the resistance between points c and d (as shown in the diagram below). This is because the circuit continues infinitely in both directions.

[Image of the circuit with points c and d marked]

**Setting up the Equation**

Let's call the resistance between points a and b (or c and d)  'R_ab'.  We can now analyze the circuit:

* **Resistors in Parallel:** The two resistors with value 'R' between points c and d are in parallel. Their equivalent resistance is R/2.
* **Resistors in Series:** The equivalent resistance of the parallel combination (R/2) is in series with the resistor 'R' between points c and b. This gives us a total resistance of R + R/2 = 3R/2.

**The Recursive Relationship**

Since the resistance between points c and d is the same as the resistance between points a and b, we can write:

R_ab = 3R/2

**Solving for R_ab**

We know R = 1, so:

R_ab = (3 * 1) / 2 = 3/2

990,"In $\odot S$, $m \widehat {PQR}=98$, Find $m \widehat {PQ}$.",49,"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Understanding the Diagram:** The diagram shows a circle with center S.  Line segment QS is a diameter of the circle, and line segment PR is a chord.

* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Central Angle Theorem:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * **Arc Addition Postulate:** The measure of an arc formed by two adjacent arcs is the sum of the measures of the two arcs.

* **Solution:**
    1. **Central Angle:** Since QS is a diameter, angle QSR is a central angle and its measure is equal to the measure of arc PQR, which is 98 degrees.
    2. **Arc Addition:**  Arc PQR is made up of arc PQ and arc QR.  We know that arc PQR = 98 degrees and arc QR = 6 degrees (since it's a central angle with a measure of 6 degrees).
    3. **Finding Arc PQ:**  Therefore, arc PQ = arc PQR - arc QR = 98 degrees - 6 degrees = 92 degrees.

* **Answer:**  The measure of arc PQ is 92 degrees.",False,0,3.0989298820495605,553.0
930,如图，F是△ABC的角平分线CD和BE的交点，CG⊥AB于点G．若∠ACG＝32°，则∠BFC的度数是（）,119°,"The problem asks for the measure of angle BFC.  We can solve this by using the following steps:

1. **Identify the relevant angles:** We know that angle ACG is 32 degrees. We also know that CG is perpendicular to AB, so angle CGB is 90 degrees.

2. **Use angle relationships:** Since CG is the angle bisector of angle ACB, we know that angle ACG is equal to angle BCG. Therefore, angle BCG is also 32 degrees.

3. **Find angle BGC:** The angles in triangle CGB add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle BGC is 180 - 90 - 32 = 58 degrees.

4. **Find angle BFC:** Since BF is the angle bisector of angle ABC, we know that angle BFC is equal to angle BFE.  The angles in triangle BFC add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle BFC is (180 - 58) / 2 = 61 degrees.

**Therefore, the measure of angle BFC is 61 degrees.**",False,0,2.7980170249938965,553.0
955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"The problem asks for the measure of angle ADE in a regular pentagon ABCDE.

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Central Angle:**  Since ABCDE is a regular pentagon, each central angle (like angle AOB) is 360 degrees / 5 sides = 72 degrees.

2. **Inscribed Angle:** Angle ADE is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AE.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

3. **Arc Measure:** Arc AE is made up of two central angles: AOB and BOE, each measuring 72 degrees.  Therefore, arc AE measures 72 degrees + 72 degrees = 144 degrees.

4. **Angle ADE:**  Angle ADE is half the measure of arc AE, so it measures 144 degrees / 2 = 72 degrees.

**Therefore, the measure of angle ADE is 72 degrees.**

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Angles on a Straight Line:** The angles formed by the two line segments on line l add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, x + 70 = 180.
* **Solve for x:** Subtract 70 from both sides of the equation: x = 110.
* **Find y:** We know y is equal to the square of x. So, y = x² = 110² = 12100.

**Therefore, the value of y is 12100.**
