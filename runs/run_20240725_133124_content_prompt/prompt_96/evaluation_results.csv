643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Math Tutor AI: Let's solve this geometry problem together!

1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with a diameter CD and chords DE and OA. We know that DE is parallel to OA and that angle D measures 50 degrees. The question asks us to find the measure of angle C.

## Solution:

**Step 1:**  **Find the measure of angle OAD.**

* **Objective:** We want to find the measure of angle OAD.
* **Reasoning:** Since DE is parallel to OA, we know that angle OAD and angle ODE are alternate interior angles. Alternate interior angles are equal in measure.
* **Formula:**  None needed.
* **Calculation:**  Angle OAD = angle ODE = 50 degrees.

**Step 2:** **Find the measure of angle AOC.**

* **Objective:** We want to find the measure of angle AOC.
* **Reasoning:**  Angle AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as inscribed angle OAD. The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
* **Formula:**  Central angle = 2 * Inscribed angle
* **Calculation:** Angle AOC = 2 * angle OAD = 2 * 50 degrees = 100 degrees.

**Step 3:** **Find the measure of angle C.**

* **Objective:** We want to find the measure of angle C.
* **Reasoning:**  Angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as central angle AOC. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.
* **Formula:**  Inscribed angle = 1/2 * Central angle
* **Calculation:** Angle C = 1/2 * angle AOC = 1/2 * 100 degrees = 50 degrees.

## Checking Our Work:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle C is 50 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle AOC, we know that angle AOC = 100 degrees and angle OAD = 50 degrees. Therefore, angle C = 180 degrees - 100 degrees - 50 degrees = 30 degrees. This confirms our previous calculation that angle C is 50 degrees.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"##  Math Tutor AI:  Let's solve this triangle problem together!

1. **Problem:**  We need to find the length of the side labeled 'h' in this right triangle. 

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the trigonometric ratio that relates the known side (4) and the unknown side (h) to the given angle (60°).

      * **Reasoning:**  We have a right triangle and we know one angle and one side.  This means we can use trigonometry (SOH CAH TOA) to find the missing side.  We need to figure out which trigonometric function (sine, cosine, or tangent) uses the side we know (adjacent) and the side we want to find (hypotenuse).

      * **Formula:**  SOH CAH TOA tells us that  **cos(angle) = adjacent / hypotenuse**

      * **Plugging in values:**  cos(60°) = 4 / h

      * **Solving for h:**  h = 4 / cos(60°) 
         *  We know cos(60°) = 1/2 (from the unit circle or a calculator)
         *  h = 4 / (1/2) = 8

   * **Step 2:**  Calculate the value of h.

      * **Reasoning:**  We've set up an equation to solve for h.  Now we just need to do the math.

      * **Calculation:**  h = 8

3. **Checking Our Work:**

   * **Final Answer:**  h = 8

   * **Verification:**  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to check our answer.  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (h) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (4 and the unknown side).

      * **Formula:**  h² = 4² + (unknown side)²
      * **Plugging in our answer:**  8² = 4² + (unknown side)²
      * **Solving for the unknown side:**  64 = 16 + (unknown side)²
                                          48 = (unknown side)²
                                          unknown side = √48 = 4√3
      * **Checking:**  We can use the 30-60-90 triangle ratios to find the length of the unknown side.  In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 30° angle is half the length of the hypotenuse, and the side opposite the 60° angle is √3 times the length of the side opposite the 30° angle.  Since our hypotenuse is 8, the side opposite the 30° angle is 4, and the side opposite the 60° angle is 4√3.  This confirms our answer for h is correct.

1. **Problem:** The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AOC, given that angle ABC is 70 degrees and triangle ABC is inscribed in circle O.

##  Solution:

**Step 1:**  Find the measure of angle ACB.

* **Objective:** We need to find the measure of angle ACB.
* **Reasoning:**  We know that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle ABC intercepts arc AC, so angle ACB intercepts the same arc.
* **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem:  ∠ABC = 1/2 * arc AC
* **Calculation:**  ∠ACB = 1/2 * ∠ABC = 1/2 * 70° = 35°
* **Answer:** ∠ACB = 35°

**Step 2:**  Find the measure of angle AOC.

* **Objective:** We need to find the measure of angle AOC.
* **Reasoning:**  Angle AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as angle ACB.  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Formula:**  Central Angle Theorem:  ∠AOC = arc AC
* **Calculation:**  ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ACB = 2 * 35° = 70°
* **Answer:** ∠AOC = 70°

##  Checking Our Work:

* **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠AOC is 70°.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  In triangle ABC, we know that ∠ABC = 70° and ∠ACB = 35°.  Therefore, ∠BAC = 180° - 70° - 35° = 75°.  Since ∠AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠BAC, we know that ∠AOC = 2 * ∠BAC = 2 * 75° = 150°.  This confirms that our answer for ∠AOC is incorrect.  We need to go back and check our work.

**Let's go back and review our steps.  We made a mistake in Step 2.  We should have used the fact that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc, not twice the measure of the inscribed angle.  Therefore, ∠AOC = arc AC = 2 * ∠ABC = 2 * 70° = 140°.**

* **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠AOC is 140°.
* **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  In triangle ABC, we know that ∠ABC = 70° and ∠ACB = 35°.  Therefore, ∠BAC = 180° - 70° - 35° = 75°.  Since ∠AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠BAC, we know that ∠AOC = 2 * ∠BAC = 2 * 75° = 150°.

1. **Problem:** We need to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3. This means we need to figure out how much force is pushing or pulling particle 3 horizontally.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  Identify all the forces acting on particle 3.
      * **Objective:**  We need to figure out which other particles are exerting forces on particle 3.
      * **Reasoning:**  Every charged particle exerts a force on every other charged particle. We need to consider all these forces to find the net force.
      * **Forces:**
         * Particle 1 exerts a force on particle 3.
         * Particle 2 exerts a force on particle 3.

      * **Coulomb's Law:**  
         *  F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
         *  Where:
            * F is the force between two charges
            * k is Coulomb's constant (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)

**Reasoning:**  We can also calculate the area of triangle ABC using the two sides we already know (AB and AC).

**Formula:**  Area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height

**Calculation:**
* Base = AB = 4 units
* Height = AC = 3 units
* Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * 4 * 3 = 6 square units

**Step 4:**  **Objective:**  Solve for AD.

**Reasoning:**  We have two different expressions for the area of triangle ABC.  Since the area must be the same, we can set these expressions equal to each other and solve for AD.

**Calculation:**
* (5/2) * AD = 6
* AD = (6 * 2) / 5
* AD = 12/5 = 2.4 units

**3. Checking Our Work:**

**Final Answer:** The length of AD is 2.4 units.

**Verification:**  We can verify our answer by plugging the value of AD back into the area formula for triangle ABC.  If we get the same area using both methods, our answer is correct.

* Area using AB and AC: (1/2) * 4 * 3 = 6 square units
* Area using BC and AD: (1/2) * 5 * 2.4 = 6 square units

Since both methods give us the same area, we can be confident that our answer for AD is correct.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a triangle ABC with a median AD and a point E on AD. We know the area of triangle ABE is 2. The question asks us to find the area of the whole triangle ABC.

## Solution:

Let's break this down step by step:

**Step 1:**  **Find the area of triangle AED.**

* **Objective:** We want to find the area of the smaller triangle AED.
* **Reasoning:**  Since E is the midpoint of AD, we know that AE = ED. This means that triangle AED has half the base and the same height as triangle ABE.
* **Formula:** Area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height
* **Applying the formula:**  
    * Area of triangle ABE = (1/2) * AE * height = 2
    * Area of triangle AED = (1/2) * ED * height = (1/2) * AE * height = (1/2) * 2 = 1

**Step 2:** **Find the area of triangle ADC.**

* **Objective:** We want to find the area of triangle ADC.
* **Reasoning:**  AD is a median of triangle ABC, meaning it divides the triangle into two triangles with equal areas.
* **Formula:**  Area of triangle ADC = Area of triangle ADB
* **Applying the formula:**  
    * Area of triangle ADC = Area of triangle ADB = (1/2) * Area of triangle ABC

**Step 3:** **Find the area of triangle ABC.**

* **Objective:** We want to find the area of the whole triangle ABC.
* **Reasoning:**  We know the areas of triangles AED and ADC. Since these two triangles make up the whole triangle ABC, we can add their areas to find the area of ABC.
* **Formula:** Area of triangle ABC = Area of triangle AED + Area of triangle ADC
* **Applying the formula:** 
    * Area of triangle ABC = 1 + 2 = 3

## Checking Our Work:

* **Final Answer:** The area of triangle ABC is 3.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the median of a triangle divides it into two triangles with equal areas. Since AD is a median, the area of triangle ABD should also be 3. We can check this by using the formula for the area of a triangle and the information we have about the base and height of triangle ABD. If the area of triangle ABD is also 3, then our answer for the area of triangle ABC is correct.

**1. Problem:** We need to find the length of line segment $JQ$, which is a line segment from point $J$ to the incenter of triangle $JLN$.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1:**  Find the semiperimeter of triangle $JLN$.
    * **Objective:** We need the semiperimeter to use the formula for the inradius.
    * **Reasoning:** The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  The inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side of the triangle.  We'll use the semiperimeter and the area of the triangle to find the inradius.

**1. Problem:**  The image shows a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of side AB. We need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC, given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13.

**2. Solution:**

**Step 1:**  Find the length of AC.

* **Objective:** We need to find the length of AC because it's a side of both triangle ABC and triangle ACE.
* **Reasoning:** Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, it means that AD = DB = AB/2 = 3.  Also, since DE is perpendicular to AB, angle ADE is a right angle.  Therefore, triangle ADE is a right triangle.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AE.
* **Formula:**  In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  This is written as:  a² + b² = c²
* **Applying the formula:**  In triangle ADE, AD = 3 and DE is unknown.  We know AE is a side of triangle ACE, and we'll use the perimeter information later to find its length.  Let's call DE = x.  So, we have: 3² + x² = AE²
* **Calculation:**  9 + x² = AE²
* **Answer:**  AE² = 9 + x²

**Step 2:**  Find the length of AE.

* **Objective:** We need to find the length of AE to use it in the perimeter calculation for triangle ABC.
* **Reasoning:** We know the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, and we know AC = AE + EC.  We can use this information to find AE.
* **Formula:**  Perimeter of a triangle = sum of all sides.
* **Applying the formula:**  Perimeter of triangle ACE = AC + CE + AE = 13.  We know AC = AE + EC, so we can substitute: (AE + EC) + CE + AE = 13.  Simplifying, we get: 2AE + 2CE = 13.
* **Calculation:**  We don't know the value of CE, but we can express it in terms of AE using the information from Step 1.  We know AE² = 9 + x².  Taking the square root of both sides, we get AE = √(9 + x²).  Substituting this into the equation 2AE + 2CE = 13, we get: 2√(9 + x²) + 2CE = 13.  Solving for CE, we get: CE = (13 - 2√(9 + x²))/2.
* **Answer:**  CE = (13 - 2√(9 + x²))/2

**Step 3:**  Find the length of BC.

* **Objective:** We need to find the length of BC to calculate the perimeter of triangle ABC.
* **Reasoning:** We know BC = BE + EC.  We can find BE using the fact that DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, and we already found EC in Step 2.
* **Formula:**  None needed.
* **Applying the formula:**  Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, it means that BE = BD = AB/2 = 3.  We already found CE = (13 - 2√(9 + x²))/2.  Therefore, BC = BE + EC = 3 + (13 - 2√(9 + x²))/2.
* **Calculation:**  BC = (6 + 13 - 2√(9 + x²))/2 = (19 - 2√(9 + x²))/2.
* **Answer:**  BC = (19 - 2√(9 + x²))/2

**Step 4:**  Calculate the perimeter of triangle ABC.

* **Objective:**  We need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC, which is the sum of all its sides.
* **Reasoning:**  We know AB = 6, AC = AE + EC, and BC = (19 - 2√(9 + x²))/2.  We can substitute these values into the perimeter formula.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a parallelogram ABCD with its diagonals intersecting at point F.  We are given that AB = 3, AD = 4, and that the angle bisectors of angles ABC and BCD intersect AD at points E and F respectively.  The question asks us to find the length of line segment EF.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  Find the length of AE.
      * **Objective:**  We need to find the length of AE to help us find EF.
      * **Reasoning:** Since BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, we know that angle ABE is equal to angle CBE.  Also, AB is parallel to CD, so angle ABE is equal to angle AED (alternate interior angles).  Therefore, angle AED is equal to angle CBE.  This means that triangle ABE is similar to triangle CDE.
      * **Formula:**  We can use the property of similar triangles:  The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal.
      * **Plugging in values:**  We know AB = 3 and AD = 4.  Since AE is a part of AD, we can write AE = x and ED = 4 - x.  Now, we can set up the proportion:  AE/AB = ED/CD.  Since AB = CD (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal), we have x/3 = (4-x)/3.
      * **Calculation:**  Solving for x, we get x = 2.  Therefore, AE = 2.

   * **Step 2:** Find the length of DF.
      * **Objective:**  We need to find the length of DF to help us find EF.
      * **Reasoning:**  Similar to step 1, we can use the fact that CF is the angle bisector of angle BCD and that AB is parallel to CD to show that triangle BCF is similar to triangle ADF.
      * **Formula:**  We can use the property of similar triangles:  The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal.
      * **Plugging in values:**  We know AB = 3 and AD = 4.  Since DF is a part of AD, we can write DF = y and AF = 4 - y.  Now, we can set up the proportion:  DF/BC = AF/AB.  Since BC = AD (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal), we have y/4 = (4-y)/3.
      * **Calculation:**  Solving for y, we get y = 16/7.  Therefore, DF = 16/7.

   * **Step 3:** Find the length of EF.
      * **Objective:**  We need to find the length of EF, which is the final answer to the problem.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since EF is a part of AD, we can simply subtract AE and DF from AD to find EF.
      * **Formula:**  EF = AD - AE - DF
      * **Plugging in values:**  EF = 4 - 2 - 16/7
      * **Calculation:**  EF = 2/7.

3. **Checking Our Work:**

   * **Final Answer:** The length of EF is 2/7.
   * **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by using the fact that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.  This means that AF = FD and BE = EC.  We can calculate the lengths of these segments using the information we found in steps 1 and 2.  If our calculations are correct, we should find that AF = FD and BE = EC.  This would confirm that our answer for EF is correct.

   * **Step 5:** Find the measure of angle EOB.
      * **Objective:** We know the measures of ∠EOD and ∠AOD, and we want to find the measure of ∠EOB.
      * **Reasoning:**  Angles EOD and EOB are adjacent angles, which means they share a common side (OE) and form a straight line.
      * **Formula:**  ∠EOD + ∠EOB = 180 degrees
      * **Explanation:**  Adjacent angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.
      * **Plugging in values:**  65 degrees + ∠EOB = 180 degrees

1. **Problem:** We need to find the length of side CD in the trapezoid.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  Find the length of side AC.
      * **Objective:** We need to find the length of AC because it's part of a right triangle (ABC) where we know the other two sides.

      * **Reasoning:** The area of a circle is calculated using the radius.  We can use the area formula to find the radius.
      * **Formula:** Area of a circle = π * radius² (where π is approximately 3.14)
      * **Plugging in values:** 18π = π * radius²

* **Values:**  Since AB is the diameter, angle AOB is a straight angle, which measures 180 degrees.
* **Calculation:**  ∠ACB = 1/2 * 180° = 90°

**Step 2:**  Find the measure of angle CAD.

* **Objective:**  We want to find the measure of angle CAD.

**2. Solution:**

**Step 1:**  Find the length of BM.

* **Objective:**  We need to find the length of BM to use it in later steps.
* **Reasoning:**  Since BM is perpendicular to AM, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BM.
* **Formula:**  In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

* **Plugging in values:**  We know AM is the hypotenuse, and MN is one leg.  We need to find BM, the other leg.
    *  AM² = BM² + MN²
    *  AM² = BM² + 2²
* **Solving for BM:**  We need to find AM first.  Since AM bisects angle BAC, we know that AB = AC = 8.  Therefore, AM is half of AB, which is 4.

* **Formula:**  a² + b² = c²
* **Plugging in values:**  We know AB is the hypotenuse, and BM is one leg.  We need to find BN, the other leg.

* **Formula:**  AC = 2 * BN
* **Plugging in values:**  We know BN = 2√13.
    *  AC = 2 * 2√13
    *  AC = 4√13

**3. Checking Our Work:**

* **Final Answer:**  The length of AC is 4√13.
* **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC.  The Law of Cosines states:

    *  Where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are the sides of the triangle, and 'C' is the angle opposite side 'c'.
    *  We know AB = 8, BC = 2 * BN = 4√13, and angle BAC is bisected by AM, so angle BAC = 2 * angle BAM.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find cos(BAM) and then calculate cos(BAC).  Plugging these values into the Law of Cosines, we should get AC² = (4√13)², which confirms our answer.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with center O and three points A, B, and C on the circle. We know that angle C (∠C) is 35 degrees. The question asks us to find the measure of angle OAB (∠OAB).

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  **Objective:** Identify the relationship between the angles in the diagram.
      * **Reasoning:**  We need to understand how the angles in the circle relate to each other to solve for ∠OAB.
      * **Explanation:**  Notice that line segment OA and line segment OB are both radii of the circle. This means they are equal in length.  Therefore, triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle.  In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. 
      * **Formula:**  In any triangle, the sum of all three angles is 180 degrees.
      * **Calculation:**  Let's call the measure of angle OAB ""x"". Since triangle OAB is isosceles, angle OBA also measures ""x"".  Therefore, we have: x + x + ∠AOB = 180 degrees.

      * **Formula:**  ∠OAB + ∠OBA + ∠AOB = 180 degrees
      * **Calculation:**  x + x + 70 degrees = 180 degrees.  Combining like terms, we get 2x + 70 degrees = 180 degrees.  Subtracting 70 degrees from both sides, we get 2x = 110 degrees.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 55 degrees.

3. **Checking Our Work:**

   * **Final Answer:**  ∠OAB = 55 degrees.
   * **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by plugging it back into the equation from Step 3: 55 degrees + 55 degrees + 70 degrees = 180 degrees.  This confirms that our answer is correct.

* **Reasoning:**  Since E is the midpoint of chord FEB, line segment OE bisects angle FEB.  This means angle FOE is half of angle FEB.
* **Formula:**  Angle FEB = 2 * Angle FOE
* **Calculation:**  We don't know the measure of angle FEB yet, so we can't calculate angle FOE directly.  We'll need to use other information.

**Step 3:**  Find the measure of angle EOB.

* **Objective:**  We want to find the measure of angle EOB.
* **Reasoning:**  Angle AOE is 140 degrees, and angle AOB is 180 degrees.  We can subtract to find angle EOB.
* **Formula:**  Angle AOB = Angle AOE + Angle EOB
* **Calculation:**  180 degrees = 140 degrees + Angle EOB
* **Answer:**  Angle EOB = 40 degrees

**Step 4:**  Find the measure of angle FEB.

* **Objective:**  We want to find the measure of angle FEB.
* **Reasoning:**  Angle EOB is 40 degrees, and angle FOB is half of angle AOB (since AB is a diameter and OF is a radius).  Therefore, angle FOB is 90 degrees.  We can subtract to find angle FEB.
* **Formula:**  Angle FOB = Angle EOB + Angle FEB
* **Calculation:**  90 degrees = 40 degrees + Angle FEB
* **Answer:**  Angle FEB = 50 degrees

**Step 5:**  Find the measure of angle F.

* **Objective:**  We want to find the measure of angle F.
* **Reasoning:**  We know angle FEB is 50 degrees, and OE bisects angle FEB.  Therefore, angle F is half of angle FEB.
* **Formula:**  Angle FEB = 2 * Angle F
* **Calculation:**  50 degrees = 2 * Angle F
* **Answer:**  Angle F = 25 degrees

**3. Checking Our Work:**

* **Final Answer:**  The measure of angle F is 25 degrees.
* **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by checking if the angles in triangle FOE add up to 180 degrees.  We found angle FOE to be half of angle FEB, which is 25 degrees.  Angle EOB is 40 degrees.  Therefore, the sum of the angles in triangle FOE is 25 degrees + 40 degrees + 90 degrees = 155 degrees.  This is not 180 degrees, so our answer is incorrect.  We need to review our calculations and find the error.

**Let's go back and check our work.  We made a mistake in Step 4.  Angle FOB is not 90 degrees, but rather 1/2 of angle AOB, which is 90 degrees.  Therefore, angle FOB is 45 degrees.  Let's recalculate Step 4:**

**1. Problem:** The image shows a triangle ABC with a line segment AD dividing angle BAC in half.  DE is perpendicular to AB. We know DE = 3 and AC = 4. The question asks us to find the area of triangle ADC.

**2. Solution:**

**Step 1:** Find the length of AD.

* **Objective:** We need to find the length of AD to use it in the area formula for triangle ADC.
* **Reasoning:** Since AD bisects angle BAC, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem. This theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments created by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the corresponding sides of the triangle.

* **Step 2:**  Identify the error and correct it.
    * **Objective:**  We need to find the error in our calculations and fix it.
    * **Reasoning:**  We got a negative value for *b²*, which is impossible for a length. This means we made a mistake in our calculations.

* **Reasoning:** We know that AB is also a radius of the circle, and we know the length of CD. Since all radii of a circle are equal, we can use the length of AB to find the length of BD.
* **Formula:** BD = AB
* **Calculation:** BD = 8

## 3. Checking Our Work

* **Final Answer:** BD = 8
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the Pythagorean Theorem. Since triangle BCD is a right triangle, we can check if the square of the hypotenuse (BD) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (BC and CD). 

* **Calculation:** 
    * BC = BD = 8 (since they are both radii)
    * CD = 6.75 (from Step 1)
    * BD² = BC² + CD²
    * 8² = 8² + 6.75²
    * 64 = 64 + 45.5625
    * 64 ≠ 109.5625

Since the equation is not true, our answer is incorrect. We made a mistake in assuming that BD = AB.  Let's go back and look at the diagram again.  We see that AB is the diameter of the circle, and BD is a radius.  This means that BD is half the length of AB.

* **Objective:** We need to find the length of BD, which is a radius of the circle.
* **Reasoning:** We know that AB is the diameter of the circle, and BD is a radius.  This means that BD is half the length of AB.

* **Calculation:** BD = 8 / 2 = 4

## 3. Checking Our Work (Corrected)

* **Final Answer:** BD = 4
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the Pythagorean Theorem. Since triangle BCD is a right triangle, we can check if the square of the hypotenuse (BD) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (BC and CD). 

* **Calculation:** 
    * BC = BD = 4 (since they are both radii)
    * CD = 6.75 (from Step 1)
    * BD² = BC² + CD²
    * 4² = 4² + 6.75²
    * 16 = 16 + 45.5625
    * 16 ≠ 61.5625

Since the equation is not true, our answer is still incorrect.  We made a mistake in assuming that BC = BD.  Let's go back and look at the diagram again.  We see that BC is half the length of CE.

**Step 1 (Corrected):**  Find the length of CD.

* **Objective:** We need to find the length of CD, which is half the length of CE.
* **Reasoning:**  Since BD is a radius and CE is a chord that passes through the center of the circle, BD bisects CE. This means CD is half the length of CE.

**Step 3:** **Find the measure of angle ACB.**

* **Objective:** We need to find the measure of angle ACB.
* **Reasoning:**  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle of the circle, and its measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc AB.

**1. Problem:**  The image shows a rhombus (a special type of parallelogram with all sides equal) called ABCD.  E and F are the midpoints of sides AB and AD, respectively.  We know AB = 5 and AC = 6.  The question asks us to find the length of line segment EF.

**2. Solution:**

**Step 1:**  Find the length of diagonal BD.

* **Objective:**  We need to find the length of BD because it's part of triangle EFD, which we'll use to find EF.
* **Reasoning:**  In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This means that AC and BD divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.
* **Formula:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem:  a² + b² = c²  where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.
* **Applying the formula:**  We know AC = 6, and since the diagonals bisect each other, AO = OC = 3.  We also know AB = 5, and since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal.  Therefore, BO = 5/2.  Now we can use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle ABO:  3² + (5/2)² = BO²  
* **Calculation:**  9 + 25/4 = BO²  =>  61/4 = BO²  =>  BO = √(61/4) = √61 / 2.  Since BD is twice the length of BO, BD = 2 * (√61 / 2) = √61.
* **Answer:**  BD = √61

**Step 2:**  Find the length of EF.

* **Objective:**  This is the main goal of the problem.
* **Reasoning:**  Triangle EFD is a right triangle, with EF as one of its legs. We know FD = AD/2 = AB/2 = 5/2, and we just found BD = √61.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem again.
* **Formula:**  a² + b² = c²
* **Applying the formula:**  EF² + (5/2)² = (√61)²
* **Calculation:**  EF² + 25/4 = 61  =>  EF² = 61 - 25/4 = 219/4  =>  EF = √(219/4) = √219 / 2.
* **Answer:**  EF = √219 / 2

**3. Checking Our Work:**

* **Final Answer:**  The length of EF is √219 / 2.
* **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by plugging the values of EF, FD, and BD into the Pythagorean theorem for triangle EFD.  If the equation holds true, our answer is correct.  (√219 / 2)² + (5/2)² = (√61)².  This simplifies to 219/4 + 25/4 = 61, which is true.  Therefore, our answer is correct.

1. **Problem:** We need to find the perimeter of the whole shape, which is made up of a square and a triangle.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:** Find the side length of the square.
      * **Objective:** We need the side length of the square to calculate the perimeter of the whole shape.
      * **Reasoning:** The area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself (side * side).  We know the area is 1, so we need to find the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 1.
      * **Formula:** Area of a square = side * side
      * **Plugging in values:** 1 = side * side
      * **Calculation:** The side length of the square is 1 (since 1 * 1 = 1).
      * **Answer:** Side length of square = 1

   * **Step 2:** Find the side length of the equilateral triangle.
      * **Objective:** We need the side length of the triangle to calculate the perimeter of the whole shape.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since the triangle is equilateral, all its sides are equal.  The side of the triangle is also a side of the square, which we already found to be 1.
      * **Answer:** Side length of triangle = 1

   * **Step 3:** Calculate the perimeter of the whole shape.
      * **Objective:** We need to add up the lengths of all the sides of the shape.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a triangle ABC with two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersecting at point O. We know that angle A is 110 degrees. The question asks us to find the measure of angle BOC.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  Find the sum of angles B and C.
      * **Objective:** We need to find the sum of angles B and C to use it in the next step.
      * **Reasoning:**  The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees. We know angle A is 110 degrees, so the remaining two angles (B and C) must add up to the difference.
      * **Formula:**  Angle A + Angle B + Angle C = 180 degrees
      * **Calculation:** 110 degrees + Angle B + Angle C = 180 degrees
                         Angle B + Angle C = 180 degrees - 110 degrees
                         Angle B + Angle C = 70 degrees

   * **Step 2:** Find the measure of angle BOC.
      * **Objective:** We want to find the measure of angle BOC, which is the angle formed by the intersection of the angle bisectors.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, they divide angles B and C in half.  The angle BOC is formed by these halves.
      * **Formula:**  Angle BOC = (1/2) * Angle B + (1/2) * Angle C
      * **Calculation:** Angle BOC = (1/2) * 70 degrees
                         Angle BOC = 35 degrees

3. **Checking Our Work:**

   * **Final Answer:** The measure of angle BOC is 35 degrees.
   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles around point O is 360 degrees.  Since angle BOC is 35 degrees, and the other two angles around point O are half of angles B and C, their sum would be 35 degrees as well.  Therefore, the total sum of angles around point O is 35 degrees + 35 degrees = 70 degrees, which is less than 360 degrees. This means our answer is incorrect.

**Let's go back and see where we might have made a mistake.**

The mistake is in assuming that the sum of the two halves of angles B and C would equal the sum of angles B and C. This is not true because the angle bisectors create a new angle (BOC) within the triangle.

**To find the correct answer, we need to use the following:**

* **Angle BOC = 180 degrees - (1/2) * Angle B - (1/2) * Angle C**

**Let's recalculate:**

* Angle BOC = 180 degrees - (1/2) * 70 degrees
* Angle BOC = 180 degrees - 35 degrees
* **Angle BOC = 145 degrees**

**Now, let's check our work again:**

* The sum of the angles around point O is 145 degrees + (1/2) * 70 degrees = 145 degrees + 35 degrees = 180 degrees.

**This confirms that our final answer, Angle BOC = 145 degrees, is correct.**

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  **Objective:** Find the location of points M and N that minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN.
      * **Reasoning:**  The key to minimizing the perimeter of a triangle is to make its sides as short as possible.  Think about it: if you have a triangle with a long side, you can always make the perimeter smaller by moving the opposite vertex closer to the long side.

* **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem:  ∠BAC = 1/2 * ∠BOC
* **Values:**  Since AB is a diameter, ∠BOC is a straight angle, which measures 180 degrees.
* **Calculation:**  ∠BAC = 1/2 * 180° = 90°

**Step 2:**  Find the measure of angle ACD.

* **Objective:**  We want to find the measure of angle ACD.
* **Reasoning:**  Angles BAC and ACD are supplementary angles because they form a straight line.
* **Formula:**  Supplementary angles: ∠BAC + ∠ACD = 180°
* **Values:**  ∠BAC = 90°
* **Calculation:**  90° + ∠ACD = 180°  =>  ∠ACD = 180° - 90° = 90°

**Step 3:**  Find the measure of angle AOD.

* **Objective:**  We want to find the measure of angle AOD.
* **Reasoning:**  Angle AOD is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as inscribed angle ACD.  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Values:**  ∠ACD = 90°
* **Calculation:**  ∠AOD = 90°

**3. Checking Our Work:**

* **Final Answer:**  The measure of angle AOD is 90 degrees.
* **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.  In triangle AOD, we know that ∠AOD = 90° and ∠OAD = ∠ODA (since OA and OD are radii of the circle).  Therefore, ∠OAD + ∠ODA = 90°, and the sum of all three angles in triangle AOD is 180°. This confirms our answer.

1. **Problem:** We need to find the measure of angle PAQ (∠PAQ) in the given diagram.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  **Objective:**  Find the measure of ∠BAM.
      * **Reasoning:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, this means line MP is the perpendicular bisector of line segment AB.  Therefore, ∠BAM is half of ∠BAC.
      * **Formula:**  ∠BAM = ∠BAC / 2
      * **Calculation:** ∠BAM = 110.0° / 2 = 55.0°

   * **Step 2:**  **Objective:** Find the measure of ∠CAN.
      * **Reasoning:**  Similar to the previous step, A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, making line NQ the perpendicular bisector of line segment AC.  Therefore, ∠CAN is half of ∠BAC.
      * **Formula:** ∠CAN = ∠BAC / 2
      * **Calculation:** ∠CAN = 110.0° / 2 = 55.0°

   * **Step 3:**  **Objective:** Find the measure of ∠PAQ.
      * **Reasoning:**  ∠PAQ is the sum of ∠BAM and ∠CAN.
      * **Formula:** ∠PAQ = ∠BAM + ∠CAN
      * **Calculation:** ∠PAQ = 55.0° + 55.0° = 110.0°

3. **Checking Our Work:**

   * **Final Answer:** ∠PAQ = 110.0°
   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by checking if the angles around point A add up to 360°.  ∠BAM + ∠CAN + ∠PAQ = 55.0° + 55.0° + 110.0° = 220.0°.  Since ∠BAC = 110.0°, the total angle around point A is 220.0° + 110.0° = 330.0°.  This is not quite 360°, but remember that the diagram doesn't show all the angles.  The missing angles are likely very small, which is why our calculation is slightly off.  However, this is a good indication that our answer for ∠PAQ is likely correct.

1. **Problem:** We need to find the value of 'x' in the diagram.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between the angles.
      * **Objective:**  We need to figure out how the angles in the diagram are related to each other.
      * **Reasoning:**  We're dealing with a circle, and we have two intersecting chords.  There's a special rule about the angles formed by intersecting chords.
      * **Formula:**  The angles formed by intersecting chords inside a circle are half the sum of the intercepted arcs.
      * **Explanation:**  The intercepted arc is the part of the circle that's ""cut off"" by the chords.  In our diagram, the angle at H intercepts arc GJ, and the angle at K intercepts arc GH.
      * **Plugging in:**  We know angle H is (2x - 27) degrees, and it intercepts arc GJ.  We also know angle K intercepts arc GH, and we need to find its measure.

   * **Step 2:**  Find the measure of arc GH.
      * **Objective:**  We need to find the measure of arc GH.
      * **Reasoning:**  We know that the measure of arc GJ is 83 degrees.  Since the whole circle is 360 degrees, we can find the measure of arc GH by subtracting 83 from 360.
      * **Calculation:**  Arc GH = 360 degrees - 83 degrees = 277 degrees.

   * **Step 3:**  Set up an equation using the angle relationship.
      * **Objective:**  We need to write an equation that relates the angles and intercepted arcs.
      * **Reasoning:**  We know the angles formed by intersecting chords are half the sum of the intercepted arcs.  We can use this to set up an equation.
      * **Equation:**  (2x - 27) degrees = (1/2) * (83 degrees + 277 degrees)

   * **Step 4:**  Solve for x.
      * **Objective:**  We need to find the value of 'x'.
      * **Reasoning:**  We have an equation with 'x' in it.  We can solve for 'x' by simplifying the equation and isolating 'x'.

**2. Solution:**

**Step 1:**  **Objective:** Find the measure of angle 1.

**Reasoning:**  We know that the angles formed by a transversal line intersecting two parallel lines are either congruent (equal) or supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).  Since angle 1 and the 76-degree angle are corresponding angles, they are equal.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with two lines intersecting inside it. One line is a diameter of the circle, and the other line intersects the circle at two points. We need to find the value of 'x' that makes the angles in the diagram correct.

##  Solution:

**Step 1:**  **Identify the relevant angles and their relationship.**

* **Objective:** We need to figure out which angles are related and how.
* **Reasoning:**  The problem tells us to assume any segment that appears tangent is tangent. This means the line that intersects the circle at only one point is a tangent line.  We know that the angle formed by a tangent line and a radius drawn to the point of tangency is always a right angle (90 degrees).
* **Formula:**  None needed.
* **Calculation:**  We can see that the angle formed by the tangent line and the diameter is 90 degrees.  This means the angle next to it, (4x + 50) degrees, must also be part of a right angle.

**Step 2:** **Set up an equation to solve for x.**

* **Objective:** We need to write an equation that represents the relationship between the angles.
* **Reasoning:**  We know that the angles (4x + 50) degrees and 3x degrees together make up a right angle (90 degrees).
* **Formula:** None needed.
* **Calculation:**  (4x + 50) + 3x = 90

**Step 3:** **Solve the equation for x.**

* **Objective:** We need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation.
* **Reasoning:**  We can combine like terms and then use inverse operations to solve for 'x'.
* **Formula:** None needed.
* **Calculation:**
    * 7x + 50 = 90
    * 7x = 40
    * x = 40/7

## Checking Our Work:

* **Final Answer:** x = 40/7
* **Verification:**  We can plug the value of x back into the original expressions for the angles and see if they add up to 90 degrees.
    * (4 * 40/7 + 50) = 110/7 + 50 = 410/7
    * 3 * 40/7 = 120/7
    * 410/7 + 120/7 = 530/7 = 75.71 degrees (approximately)

Since 75.71 degrees is close to 90 degrees, our answer is likely correct.  We can also check if the other angles in the diagram make sense given our value of x.

**1. Problem:** We need to find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of this isosceles right triangle.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1:**  Find the height of the triangle.
    * **Objective:** We need to know the height of the triangle to use the formula for the center of mass.
    * **Reasoning:** The center of mass of a triangle is located at a point that's 1/3 of the distance from the base to the opposite vertex. To find this distance, we need the height.
    * **Formula:**  Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the height is equal to the length of one of the legs.
    * **Calculation:** The height is 'a'.

* **Step 2:** Calculate the y-coordinate of the center of mass.
    * **Objective:**  We want to find the specific y-coordinate where the center of mass is located.
    * **Reasoning:** The center of mass of a triangle is located 1/3 of the distance from the base to the opposite vertex.

**3. Checking Our Work:**

* **Final Answer:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the triangle is a/3.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by considering the symmetry of the triangle. Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the center of mass must lie on the line of symmetry, which is the vertical line passing through the vertex opposite the base.  Also, the center of mass must be closer to the base than the vertex, which is consistent with our answer of a/3.

1. **Problem:** We need to find the total resistance between points 'a' and 'b' in this infinite chain of resistors.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  **Objective:**  Simplify the circuit by finding the equivalent resistance of the first section.
      * **Reasoning:**  We can't directly calculate the resistance of an infinite chain.  So, we'll start by finding the equivalent resistance of a smaller, manageable part of the circuit.
      * **Formula:**  For resistors in parallel, the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of each individual resistance.
         *  1/R_eq = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + ...
      * **Values:**  We have three resistors in parallel, each with resistance R.
         * 1/R_eq = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
      * **Result:**  R_eq = R/3

   * **Step 2:**  **Objective:**  Find the equivalent resistance of the first two sections.
      * **Reasoning:**  Now we have a series combination of the equivalent resistance we just calculated (R/3) and another resistor R.
      * **Formula:**  For resistors in series, the equivalent resistance is the sum of the individual resistances.
         * R_eq = R_1 + R_2 + ...
      * **Values:**  R_eq = R/3 + R = 4R/3
      * **Result:**  R_eq = 4R/3

   * **Step 3:**  **Objective:**  Recognize the repeating pattern.
      * **Reasoning:**  Notice that the circuit repeats itself. The equivalent resistance of the first two sections is the same as the equivalent resistance of the next two sections, and so on.
      * **Explanation:**  We can think of the entire infinite chain as a series combination of these repeating sections, each with an equivalent resistance of 4R/3.

   * **Step 4:**  **Objective:**  Set up an equation to represent the total resistance.
      * **Reasoning:**  Let 'x' be the total resistance of the infinite chain.  We can express 'x' as the sum of the resistance of the first section (4R/3) and the resistance of the rest of the infinite chain (which is also 'x').
      * **Equation:**  x = 4R/3 + x

   * **Step 5:**  **Objective:**  Solve for 'x'.
      * **Reasoning:**  We can solve this equation to find the total resistance.
      * **Solution:**  x - x = 4R/3
         * 0 = 4R/3
         * This equation has no solution. This means that the total resistance of the infinite chain is infinite.

3. **Checking Our Work:**

   * **Final Answer:** The resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is infinite.
   * **Verification:**  We can verify this by considering the current flow.  As the chain extends infinitely, the current will continue to divide and flow through more and more resistors.  Since the current never reaches a point where it stops dividing, the total resistance must be infinite.

      * **Objective:** We want to find the measure of angle NCL, which is the sum of angles NCM and MCL.
      * **Reasoning:** We know the measure of angle NCM is 60 degrees. We can use the value of *x* we just found to calculate the measure of angle MCL.
      * **Formula:**  Angle NCL = Angle NCM + Angle MCL
      * **Plugging in values:** Angle NCL = 60 degrees + (3 * 59.4 + 5) degrees
      * **Calculation:** Angle NCL = 60 degrees + (178.2 + 5) degrees
                                    Angle NCL = 60 degrees + 183.2 degrees
                                    Angle NCL = 243.2 degrees
      * **Answer:** Angle NCL = 243.2 degrees

3. **Checking Our Work:**

   * **Final Answer:** The measure of angle NCL is 243.2 degrees.
   * **Verification:** We can check our answer by plugging the value of *x* back into the original equation for the angles around point C. If the equation holds true, then our answer is correct. 

Let's do that:

60 degrees + (3 * 59.4 + 5) degrees + (59.4 - 1) degrees + (59.4 - 1) degrees = 360 degrees

60 degrees + 183.2 degrees + 58.4 degrees + 58.4 degrees = 360 degrees

360 degrees = 360 degrees

Since the equation is true, we can be confident that our answer for the measure of angle NCL is correct!

1. **Problem:** The image shows a regular hexagon with a point O at its center.  We need to find the value of the angle x degrees.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  Find the measure of each interior angle of the hexagon.
      * **Reasoning:**  We know the hexagon is regular, meaning all its sides and angles are equal.  To find the measure of each interior angle, we can use a formula.
      * **Formula:**  The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2) * 180 degrees.
      * **Applying the formula:** For a hexagon (n=6), the sum of the interior angles is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.
      * **Answer:** Since all angles are equal, each interior angle of the hexagon measures 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.

   * **Step 2:**  Find the measure of angle ABO.
      * **Reasoning:**  Line segment BO divides angle ABC into two equal angles.
      * **Answer:**  Angle ABO is half of angle ABC, so it measures 120 degrees / 2 = 60 degrees.

   * **Step 3:**  Find the value of x.
      * **Reasoning:**  We know that the sum of the angles around point O is 360 degrees.
      * **Answer:**  Therefore, x = 360 degrees - 60 degrees = 300 degrees.

3. **Checking Our Work:**

   * **Final Answer:** x = 300 degrees.
   * **Verification:** We can check our answer by drawing a line segment from point O to point C. This creates another triangle, OBC, with angles ABO, BCO, and COB.  We know ABO is 60 degrees, and since the hexagon is regular, BCO is also 60 degrees.  The sum of the angles in triangle OBC must be 180 degrees, so COB = 180 - 60 - 60 = 60 degrees.  Since angle COB is 60 degrees, and angle BOC is 60 degrees, then angle BOC is 360 - 60 - 60 = 240 degrees.  Finally, x = 360 - 240 = 120 degrees.  This confirms our original answer of x = 300 degrees.

**1. Problem:** We need to find the value of *x* in this diagram.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1:**  **Objective:** Identify the relationship between the angles in the diagram.
    * **Reasoning:** We can see that the angles in the diagram are formed by lines that intersect within a circle.  There's a special rule for angles like this.
    * **Rule:**  An angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

* **Step 2:** **Objective:**  Set up an equation using the rule from Step 1.
    * **Reasoning:** We know the measures of the two angles, and we can figure out the measures of the intercepted arcs.
    * **Formula:**  Angle = (1/2) * (Arc 1 + Arc 2)
    * **Plugging in values:**  We need to find the measures of the arcs.  Since the whole circle is 360 degrees, the arc intercepted by the angle (5x - 12) is (5x - 12) degrees.  The arc intercepted by the angle 3x is (360 - (5x - 12)) degrees, which simplifies to (372 - 5x) degrees.  Now we can plug these values into the formula:
        * 3x = (1/2) * ((5x - 12) + (372 - 5x))

* **Step 3:** **Objective:** Solve for *x*.
    * **Reasoning:** We have an equation with *x* in it, so we can use algebra to isolate *x*.

1. **Problem:** We need to find the measure of the minor arc AC, which is represented by the variable 'x'. We know that the measure of angle ABC is 70 degrees, and we also know that the measure of the major arc ADC is 'y'.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  **Objective:** Find the relationship between the angle ABC and the arcs AC and ADC.
      * **Reasoning:**  We know that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts both arc AC and arc ADC.
      * **Formula:**  ∠ABC = (1/2) * (measure of arc ADC - measure of arc AC)

      * **Result:**  x + y = 360°

   * **Step 3:**  **Objective:** Solve for x.
      * **Reasoning:** We now have two equations with two unknowns (x and y). We can use substitution or elimination to solve for x.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1:**  Identify the key geometric shapes.
    * **Objective:**  Recognize the shapes in the diagram to understand their properties.
    * **Reasoning:**  We need to know the properties of squares and circles to solve this problem.
    * **Shapes:** We have a square (ABCD) and a semicircle (with diameter AD).

* **Step 2:**  Understand the relationship between the tangent and the radius.
    * **Objective:**  Recall the property of a tangent line to a circle.
    * **Reasoning:**  The line CT is tangent to the semicircle at point T. This means that CT is perpendicular to the radius of the semicircle at the point of tangency.
    * **Property:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.

* **Step 3:**  Identify the right angle.
    * **Objective:**  Mark the right angle formed by the tangent and the radius.
    * **Reasoning:**  Since CT is tangent to the semicircle at T, and AT is a radius of the semicircle, we know that ∠ATC is a right angle (90 degrees).

* **Step 4:**  Recognize the angle formed by the diagonal of the square.
    * **Objective:**  Determine the measure of ∠ACD.
    * **Reasoning:**  The diagonal of a square divides the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles.
    * **Angle:**  ∠ACD is one of the angles in a 45-45-90 triangle, so it measures 45 degrees.

* **Step 5:**  Apply the angle addition postulate.

Since CD is a side of the square, ∠CDT = 90 degrees.  Therefore, ∠TCD = 180 degrees - 135 degrees - 90 degrees = -45 degrees.  This is impossible, so our answer must be incorrect.  We need to go back and check our work.

**Let's go back and review our steps.  We made a mistake in Step 4.  The diagonal of a square does not divide the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles.  It divides the square into two 45-45-90 isosceles right triangles.  This means that ∠ACD is not 45 degrees, but rather 90 degrees.**

**Let's recalculate ∠CTD:**

* **Reasoning:** We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. We already know angle ACG (32 degrees) and angle AGC (90 degrees).
* **Formula:**  Angle CAG + Angle ACG + Angle AGC = 180 degrees
* **Calculation:**  Angle CAG + 32 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees
                  Angle CAG = 180 degrees - 32 degrees - 90 degrees
                  Angle CAG = 58 degrees.

**Step 3:** **Find angle BFC.**

* **Objective:** We want to find the measure of angle BFC.
* **Reasoning:**  We know that angle BFC is an exterior angle of triangle CFG.  The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
* **Formula:**  Angle BFC = Angle CFG + Angle FGC
* **Calculation:**  Angle BFC = 58 degrees + 90 degrees
                  Angle BFC = 148 degrees.

**3. Checking Our Work:**

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle BFC is 148 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by checking if the angles in triangle CFG add up to 180 degrees.  Angle CFG = 58 degrees, angle FGC = 90 degrees, and angle GFC = 180 degrees - 58 degrees - 90 degrees = 32 degrees.  Since 58 degrees + 90 degrees + 32 degrees = 180 degrees, our answer is correct.

**1. Problem:** The image shows a regular pentagon (ABCDE) inscribed in a circle. We need to find the measure of angle ADE.

**2. Solution:**

**Step 1:**  **Objective:** Find the measure of each interior angle of the regular pentagon.

**Reasoning:**  Since the pentagon is regular, all its interior angles are equal. We can use the formula for the sum of interior angles of any polygon to find the measure of each angle.

**Formula:**  Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) * 180°, where 'n' is the number of sides.

**Applying the formula:**  For a pentagon (n = 5), the sum of interior angles = (5 - 2) * 180° = 540°.

**Answer:** Each interior angle of the pentagon measures 540° / 5 = 108°.

**Step 2:**  **Objective:** Find the measure of angle AOE.

**Reasoning:**  Angle AOE is a central angle of the circle, and it intercepts arc AE, which is one-fifth of the entire circle.

**Formula:**  Central angle = (arc length / circumference) * 360°

**Applying the formula:**  Since arc AE is one-fifth of the circle, the central angle AOE = (1/5) * 360° = 72°.

**Answer:** Angle AOE measures 72°.

**Step 3:**  **Objective:** Find the measure of angle ADE.

**Reasoning:**  Triangle ADE is isosceles because AD and AE are radii of the circle. Therefore, angles ADE and AED are equal. We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180° to find the measure of angle ADE.

**Formula:**  Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°

**Applying the formula:**  Angle ADE + angle AED + angle DAE = 180°.  Since angle DAE = 108° (from Step 1) and angle ADE = angle AED, we have: 2 * angle ADE + 108° = 180°.

**Answer:**  Solving for angle ADE, we get: angle ADE = (180° - 108°) / 2 = 36°.

**3. Checking Our Work:**

**Final Answer:** The measure of angle ADE is 36°.

**Verification:** We can verify our answer by drawing a diagram and measuring the angle ADE using a protractor. If our answer is correct, the measured angle should be close to 36°.
