643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"**1. Problem:** In a circle with center O, diameter CD, and chord DE parallel to chord OA, angle D measures 50 degrees. Find the measure of angle C.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant geometric relationships.**
    * Since CD is a diameter, angle COD is a straight angle, measuring 180 degrees.
    * Since DE is parallel to OA, angle D and angle A are corresponding angles and therefore congruent.
    * Angle CDO is an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc as central angle COD.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
    * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted central angle. Therefore, angle CDO = (1/2) * angle COD = (1/2) * 180 degrees = 90 degrees.

* **Step 3: Apply the Angle Sum Property of Triangles.**
    * The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180 degrees. In triangle CDO, we have: angle C + angle D + angle CDO = 180 degrees.

* **Step 4: Substitute known values and solve for angle C.**
    * Substituting the known values, we get: angle C + 50 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees.
    * Simplifying the equation: angle C + 140 degrees = 180 degrees.
    * Subtracting 140 degrees from both sides: angle C = 40 degrees.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"**1. Problem:** Find the length of the hypotenuse, $h$, of a right triangle with one leg of length 4 and an acute angle of 60 degrees.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio.** We know the length of the adjacent side (4) and we want to find the length of the hypotenuse ($h$). The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is the cosine: 
    * cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse

* **Step 2: Apply the cosine function.** In this case, the angle is 60 degrees. So, we have:
    * cos(60°) = 4 / $h$

* **Step 3: Solve for h.**  We know that cos(60°) = 1/2. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
    * 1/2 = 4 / $h$

* **Step 4: Cross-multiply and solve for h.**
    * $h$ = 4 * 2
    * $h$ = 8

In a circle with center O, triangle ABC is inscribed. Given that angle ABC is 70 degrees, find the measure of angle AOC.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**
    * The theorem we need here is the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**, which states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Step 2: Apply the theorem to angle ABC.**
    * Angle ABC intercepts arc AC. Therefore, the measure of arc AC is twice the measure of angle ABC: 
    *  arc AC = 2 * ∠ABC = 2 * 70° = 140°.

* **Step 3: Relate angle AOC to arc AC.**
    * Angle AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc AC as angle ABC. 

* **Step 4: Apply the Central Angle Theorem.**
    * The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * Therefore, ∠AOC = arc AC = 140°.

Given that lines AB and CD intersect at point O, ray OE bisects angle BOC, and angle AOD is 70 degrees, find the measure of angle AOE.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles.**
    * We are given that ∠AOD = 70°.
    * Since ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), we can find ∠BOD: ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.
    * We are also given that ray OE bisects ∠BOC, meaning it divides ∠BOC into two equal angles: ∠BOE = ∠COE.

* **Step 2: Apply the angle addition postulate.**
    * The angle addition postulate states that the measure of a larger angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its smaller adjacent angles. Therefore, ∠BOD = ∠BOE + ∠COE.

* **Step 3: Substitute and solve for ∠BOE (or ∠COE).**
    * Since ∠BOE = ∠COE, we can rewrite the equation from Step 2 as: ∠BOD = 2∠BOE.

    * Solving for ∠BOE, we find: ∠BOE = 110°/2 = 55°.

* **Step 4: Find ∠AOE.**
    * ∠AOE is the sum of ∠AOD and ∠DOE.
    * Since ∠DOE is the same as ∠BOE (they are vertical angles), we have: ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠BOE.

* q3 = -200 nC
* q4 = 200 nC

The side length of the square is a = 5.0 cm. Determine the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**
    * Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to particles 1, 2, and 4.
    * The force due to particle 1 is purely in the y-direction, so it doesn't contribute to the x-component of the net force.

    * The force F43 is purely in the x-direction.

* **Step 4: Calculate the net x-component of the force.**
    * Net force in the x-direction: Fnetx = F23x + F43 = (k * |q2 * q3| / (2a^2)) * (1/√2) + k * |q4 * q3| / a^2

In a 4x4 square grid where each small square has a side length of 1, points A, B, and C are located on grid points. AD is perpendicular to BC at point D. Find the length of AD.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify the coordinates of points A, B, and C.**
    * From the image, we can see that the coordinates of the points are:
        * A: (0, 4)
        * B: (0, 0)
        * C: (4, 2)

* **Step 2: Calculate the slope of line BC.**
    * The slope of a line passing through points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    * Applying this to points B and C: (2 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 1/2

* **Step 3: Determine the slope of line AD.**
    * Since AD is perpendicular to BC, the product of their slopes is -1.
    * Therefore, the slope of AD is -1 / (1/2) = -2.

* **Step 4: Find the equation of line AD.**
    * We know the slope of AD is -2 and it passes through point A (0, 4).
    * Using the point-slope form of a linear equation (y - y1 = m(x - x1)), we get:

        * y = -2x + 4

* **Step 5: Find the coordinates of point D.**
    * Point D lies on both line AD and line BC.
    * We can substitute the equation of line AD (y = -2x + 4) into the equation of line BC (y = (1/2)x) to find the x-coordinate of D:
        * -2x + 4 = (1/2)x

        * x = 8/5
    * Substitute this value of x back into either equation to find the y-coordinate of D:
        * y = (1/2) * (8/5) = 4/5

* **Step 6: Calculate the length of AD using the distance formula.**
    * The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)
    * Applying this to points A (0, 4) and D (8/5, 4/5):
        * AD = √((8/5 - 0)² + (4/5 - 4)²)
        * AD = √((64/25) + (16/25))
        * AD = √(80/25)
        * AD = √(16/5)

The problem asks for the perimeter of triangle PCD, given that PA and PB are tangents to circle O at points A and B respectively, CD is tangent to circle O, and PA = 8.0.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Understanding Tangent Properties**
    * Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.
    * The angle between a tangent and the radius drawn to the point of tangency is 90 degrees. Hence, ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90 degrees.

* **Step 2: Analyzing Triangle Properties**
    * Since ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90 degrees, quadrilaterals OACD and OBCD are cyclic quadrilaterals (all four vertices lie on a circle).
    * In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles are supplementary. Therefore, ∠CAD + ∠CBD = 180 degrees.

* **Step 3: Finding the Perimeter**
    * The perimeter of triangle PCD is PC + CD + PD.
    * Since ∠CAD + ∠CBD = 180 degrees, we can conclude that ∠ACD + ∠BCD = 180 degrees (angles on a straight line).
    * Therefore, ∠ACD and ∠BCD are supplementary angles.
    * In triangle PCD, we have ∠ACD + ∠BCD + ∠CPD = 180 degrees.
    * Since ∠ACD and ∠BCD are supplementary, ∠CPD = 0 degrees.

    * We are also given that BD is perpendicular to CD, meaning angle BDC is 90 degrees.
    * We know that angle A equals angle ABD.

* **Step 2: Apply angle properties.**
    * Since angle BDC is 90 degrees, angle BDC + angle BDC = 180 degrees. Therefore, angle CBD = 180 - 90 = 90 degrees.
    * Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle ACD = angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB.
    * We know that angle DBC + angle BCD = angle CBD. Substituting the known values, we get 54 + (1/2) * angle ACB = 90.

* **Step 1: Understanding Medians and Midpoints**
    * A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
    * The midpoint of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts.

* **Step 2: Applying the Area Ratio Property**
    * The area of a triangle is directly proportional to the length of its base when the height remains constant.
    * Since E is the midpoint of AD, AE = ED.
    * Therefore, the base of triangle ABE (AE) is half the base of triangle ABD (AD).
    * Keeping the height from point B to AD constant, the area of triangle ABE is half the area of triangle ABD.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Understanding Scale Factor:** The scale factor in a dilation is the ratio of corresponding side lengths in the image and pre-image. In this case, we need to find the ratio of a side length in $Q'$ to the corresponding side length in $Q$.

* **Identifying Corresponding Sides:**  The image shows that the side length of $Q$ adjacent to point $C$ is 5 units. The corresponding side length in $Q'$ is the distance between point $C$ and the point where the line segment connecting $Q'$ and $C$ intersects the horizontal axis. This distance is represented by $x$.

* **Using Proportions:** Since the dilation is centered at point $C$, the ratio of corresponding side lengths is constant. We can set up a proportion: 
    * $\frac{x}{5} = \frac{15}{x + 5}$

* **Solving for x:**
    * Cross-multiply: $x(x + 5) = 75$
    * Expand: $x^2 + 5x = 75$
    * Rearrange into a quadratic equation: $x^2 + 5x - 75 = 0$
    * Factor the quadratic: $(x + 15)(x - 5) = 0$
    * Solve for x: $x = -15$ or $x = 5$

* **Choosing the Valid Solution:** Since length cannot be negative, we discard $x = -15$. Therefore, $x = 5$.

* **Calculating the Scale Factor:** The scale factor is the ratio of corresponding side lengths: $\frac{x}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1$.

**3. Final Answer:** The scale factor from $Q$ to $Q'$ is **1**. This indicates that the dilation is an isometry, meaning it preserves size and shape.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Understanding the Incenter:** The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. It is also the center of the triangle's inscribed circle, which means it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.

* **Using the Incenter Property:** Since $Q$ is the incenter, we know that $JQ$ is the distance from the incenter to side $JL$. This distance is also equal to the radius of the inscribed circle.

* **Finding the Semiperimeter:** The semiperimeter of a triangle is half the perimeter.  Let's find the semiperimeter of $\triangle JLN$. We need to find $LN$ and $JN$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $KLM$ to find $LM$:
    * $LM^2 = KL^2 + KM^2$
    * $LM^2 = 9^2 + 9^2$
    * $LM^2 = 162$
    * $LM = \sqrt{162} = 9\sqrt{2}$

    Now, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $JQP$ to find $JP$:
    * $JP^2 = JQ^2 + QP^2$
    * $JP^2 = JQ^2 + 9^2$
    * $JP^2 = JQ^2 + 81$

    Since $Q$ is the incenter, $QP = QM = 9$.  Therefore, $JP = JM = 9\sqrt{2}$.  We can now find $JN$:
    * $JN = JP + PN = 9\sqrt{2} + 9$

    The semiperimeter, $s$, of $\triangle JLN$ is:

In parallelogram ABCD, the angle bisector of ∠ABC intersects AD at point E, and the angle bisector of ∠BCD intersects AD at point F. Given AB = 3 and AD = 4, find the length of EF.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Analyze the given information and identify relevant geometric properties.**
    * We are given a parallelogram ABCD, which means opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
    * We are also given that BE and CF are angle bisectors, meaning they divide the corresponding angles into two equal angles.
    * We need to find the length of EF, which is a segment within the parallelogram.

* **Step 2: Apply angle bisector theorem and properties of parallelograms.**
    * **Angle Bisector Theorem:** In a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides. Applying this to triangle ABE, we have AE/ED = AB/BD.
    * **Properties of Parallelograms:** Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, so BD = AC.

* **Step 3: Use the given information and the properties to set up an equation.**
    * We know AB = 3 and AD = 4. Since AE + ED = AD, we can substitute to get AE + ED = 4.
    * Using the angle bisector theorem, we have AE/ED = AB/BD = 3/AC.

* **Step 4: Solve for AE and ED.**
    * Let AE = x. Then ED = 4 - x.
    * Substituting into the equation from step 3, we get x/(4-x) = 3/AC.
    * Since AC = BD, we can rewrite the equation as x/(4-x) = 3/BD.

* **Step 5: Use the properties of parallelograms to find BD.**
    * In parallelogram ABCD, opposite sides are equal, so BD = AC.
    * Since AB = 3 and AD = 4, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AC (and therefore BD): AC² = AB² + BC² = 3² + 4² = 25.
    * Therefore, AC = BD = 5.

* **Step 6: Solve for x (AE).**
    * Substituting BD = 5 into the equation from step 4, we get x/(4-x) = 3/5.
    * Cross-multiplying, we get 5x = 12 - 3x.
    * Combining like terms, we get 8x = 12.
    * Solving for x, we get x = 12/8 = 3/2.

* **Step 7: Calculate EF.**
    * Since AE = x = 3/2 and ED = 4 - x = 4 - 3/2 = 5/2, we can find EF by subtracting: EF = AE - ED = 3/2 - 5/2 = -1.

**3. Final Answer:**

The length of EF is **-1**. However, a length cannot be negative. This indicates an error in the problem statement or the given information. It's likely there's a mistake in the diagram or the provided values.

Given that lines AB and CD intersect at point O, OD bisects ∠AOE, and ∠BOC = 50°, find the measure of ∠EOB.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles.**
    * We are given ∠BOC = 50°.
    * We need to find ∠EOB.
    * Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.

* **Step 2: Apply angle relationships.**
    * Angles ∠BOC and ∠EOD are vertically opposite angles, meaning they are equal. Therefore, ∠EOD = ∠BOC = 50°.
    * Angles ∠AOD, ∠DOE, and ∠EOB form a straight angle (180°).

* **Step 3: Set up an equation.**
    * We can express the relationship between the angles as: ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 180°
    * Since ∠AOD = ∠DOE, we can substitute: ∠DOE + ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 180°
    * Simplifying: 2∠DOE + ∠EOB = 180°

* **Step 4: Solve for ∠EOB.**
    * We know ∠DOE = 50°. Substituting: 2(50°) + ∠EOB = 180°
    * Simplifying: 100° + ∠EOB = 180°
    * Subtracting 100° from both sides: ∠EOB = 80°

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Understanding the Geometry:** Trapezoid ABCD has two parallel sides (AB and CD) and two non-parallel sides (AD and BC). Since AB and CD are parallel, we can draw a perpendicular line from C to AD, intersecting AD at point E. This creates a right triangle, CDE.

* **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:** In right triangle CDE, we know CD is the hypotenuse, DE is one leg, and CE is the other leg. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find CD: CD² = DE² + CE².

* **Finding DE:**  DE is the difference between AD and AE. Since AB is parallel to CD, AE = BC = 16. Therefore, DE = AD - AE = 23 - 16 = 7.

* **Finding CE:** CE is the same as AB, which is 24.

* **Calculating CD:** Now we have DE = 7 and CE = 24. Plugging these values into the Pythagorean theorem: CD² = 7² + 24² = 49 + 576 = 625. Taking the square root of both sides, we get CD = √625 = 25.

In the given diagram, points A, B, and C lie on a circle with radius 2. Angle C is 30 degrees. Find the length of chord AB.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant geometric properties.**
    * Since angle C is inscribed in the circle and intercepts arc AB, the measure of angle C is half the measure of arc AB. Therefore, arc AB measures 2 * 30 degrees = 60 degrees.
    * The central angle subtended by arc AB is also 60 degrees.

* **Step 2: Apply the Law of Cosines.**
    * In triangle AOB, we know:

In right triangle ABC, angle BAC is 90 degrees. Triangle ABC is rotated clockwise around point A by 90 degrees to obtain triangle AB'C'.  Line segment CC' is drawn. Given that angle CC'B' is 32 degrees, find the measure of angle AC'B'.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Visualize the Rotation**
    * Imagine rotating triangle ABC clockwise around point A by 90 degrees. This means that side AB will coincide with side AC', and side AC will coincide with side AB'. 
    * Since the rotation is 90 degrees, angle BAC will become angle B'AC', and angle ABC will become angle A'BC'.

* **Step 2: Identify Key Angles**
    * We are given that angle CC'B' is 32 degrees.
    * Since angle BAC is 90 degrees, and angle B'AC' is its rotated counterpart, angle B'AC' is also 90 degrees.

* **Step 3: Apply Angle Properties**
    * The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle B'C'C, we have:

* **Step 4: Recognize Complementary Angles**
    * Angle B'C'C and angle AC'B' are complementary angles because they form a right angle at point C'. This means:
        * angle B'C'C + angle AC'B' = 90 degrees

* **Step 5: Solve for the Unknown Angle**
    * We have two equations:

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Analyze the given information.**
    * We are given that BE bisects ∠FBD, meaning ∠FBE = ∠EBD.
    * We are also given that CE bisects ∠ACD, meaning ∠ACE = ∠ECD.
    * We know that ∠BEC = 35°.

* **Step 2: Apply the angle bisector property.**
    * Since BE bisects ∠FBD, we have ∠FBE = ∠EBD = (1/2)∠FBD.
    * Similarly, since CE bisects ∠ACD, we have ∠ACE = ∠ECD = (1/2)∠ACD.

* **Step 3: Utilize the angle sum property of triangles.**
    * In triangle BEC, we have ∠BEC + ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 180°.
    * Substituting the known values, we get 35° + ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 180°.
    * Simplifying, we get ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 145°.

* **Step 4: Express ∠BCE and ∠CBE in terms of ∠FBD and ∠ACD.**
    * From Step 2, we know ∠BCE = (1/2)∠ACD and ∠CBE = (1/2)∠FBD.
    * Substituting these values into the equation from Step 3, we get (1/2)∠ACD + (1/2)∠FBD = 145°.
    * Multiplying both sides by 2, we get ∠ACD + ∠FBD = 290°.

* **Step 5: Find ∠FAE.**
    * In triangle FAE, we have ∠FAE + ∠FEA + ∠EAF = 180°.
    * Since ∠FEA is an exterior angle of triangle BEC, we have ∠FEA = ∠BEC + ∠BCE = 35° + (1/2)∠ACD.
    * Similarly, since ∠EAF is an exterior angle of triangle BEC, we have ∠EAF = ∠BEC + ∠CBE = 35° + (1/2)∠FBD.
    * Substituting these values into the equation for triangle FAE, we get ∠FAE + (35° + (1/2)∠ACD) + (35° + (1/2)∠FBD) = 180°.
    * Simplifying, we get ∠FAE + (1/2)∠ACD + (1/2)∠FBD = 110°.
    * From Step 4, we know ∠ACD + ∠FBD = 290°.
    * Substituting this value, we get ∠FAE + (1/2)(290°) = 110°.

* **Understanding Isosceles Triangles:** An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length. In this case, since $AB = BC$, we can set their expressions equal to each other:
   
   $9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5$

* **Solving for x:** To find the value of $x$, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 
    * Subtract $5x$ from both sides: 
       $9x - 1 - 5x = 5x - 0.5 - 5x$
       $4x - 1 = -0.5$
    * Add $1$ to both sides:
       $4x - 1 + 1 = -0.5 + 1$
       $4x = 0.5$
    * Divide both sides by $4$:
       $4x / 4 = 0.5 / 4$
       $x = 0.125$

* **Finding AC:** Since $AC = BC$, we can substitute the value of $x$ into the expression for $BC$:

   $AC = BC = 5x - 0.5 = 5(0.125) - 0.5 = 0.625 - 0.5 = 0.125$

Given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees, find the measure of angle E.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify congruent angles.** Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, we know that corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle A is equal to angle D, and angle B is equal to angle F.

* **Step 2: Find angle BCD.** Since CD bisects angle BCA, we know that angle BCD is half of angle BCA.  We can find angle BCA by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees: 
    * Angle BCA = 180 degrees - angle A - angle B = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - angle B.
    * Since angle B is equal to angle F, we can substitute to get: Angle BCA = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - angle F.
    * We know that angle CGF is 88 degrees, and angle CGF is the sum of angle BCG and angle GCF. Therefore, angle BCG = angle CGF - angle GCF = 88 degrees - angle GCF.
    * Since angle GCF is equal to angle B, we can substitute to get: Angle BCG = 88 degrees - angle B.
    * Now we can find angle BCA: Angle BCA = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - (88 degrees - angle B) = 70 degrees + angle B.
    * Finally, we can find angle BCD: Angle BCD = (1/2) * angle BCA = (1/2) * (70 degrees + angle B) = 35 degrees + (1/2) * angle B.

* **Step 3: Find angle DCE.** Since angle BCD and angle DCE are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees), we can find angle DCE:
    * Angle DCE = 180 degrees - angle BCD = 180 degrees - (35 degrees + (1/2) * angle B) = 145 degrees - (1/2) * angle B.

* **Step 4: Find angle E.** Since angle DCE is equal to angle E (corresponding angles in congruent triangles), we have:
    * Angle E = angle DCE = 145 degrees - (1/2) * angle B.

* **Step 5: Substitute angle B with angle F.** Since angle B is equal to angle F, we can substitute to get:
    * Angle E = 145 degrees - (1/2) * angle F.

* **Step 6: Use the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.** We know that angle F, angle GCF, and angle GFD add up to 180 degrees. Therefore:
    * Angle F = 180 degrees - angle GCF - angle GFD = 180 degrees - angle GCF - angle E.
    * Substituting angle GCF with 88 degrees and angle E with 145 degrees - (1/2) * angle F, we get:
    * Angle F = 180 degrees - 88 degrees - (145 degrees - (1/2) * angle F) = -53 degrees + (1/2) * angle F.
    * Solving for angle F, we get: (1/2) * angle F = 53 degrees, so angle F = 106 degrees.

* **Step 7: Substitute angle F back into the equation for angle E.**
    * Angle E = 145 degrees - (1/2) * angle F = 145 degrees - (1/2) * 106 degrees = 92 degrees.

In the given circle with center O, AB is the diameter, points C and D lie on the circle, and ∠BCD = 25°. Find the measure of ∠AOD.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
    * We are given ∠BCD = 25°.

Problem:** Given that ∠BAC = 110° and points A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and points A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, determine the measure of ∠PAQ.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Symmetry and Angles:**  Symmetry implies that the line of symmetry bisects the angle formed by the symmetrical points. Therefore:
    * Line MP bisects ∠BAM, meaning ∠BAP = ∠MAP.
    * Line NQ bisects ∠CAN, meaning ∠CAQ = ∠NAQ.

* **Angle Sum Property:** The angles around a point add up to 360°. Applying this to point A:

* **Substitution:** Substitute the known values and the relationships from symmetry:
    * ∠MAP + 110° + ∠NAQ = 360°

* **Combining Angles:** Since ∠MAP and ∠NAQ are half of ∠BAM and ∠CAN respectively, their sum is half of the sum of ∠BAM and ∠CAN.  Also, ∠BAM + ∠CAN = ∠BAC = 110°. Therefore:

    * ∠GHJ intercepts arc GH. Therefore, the measure of arc GH is twice the measure of ∠GHJ:
        * m(arc GH) = 2 * ∠GHJ = 2 * 83° = 166°

* **Step 3: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem to find the measure of the intercepted arc for the other angle.**
    * ∠KJH intercepts arc KH. Therefore, the measure of arc KH is twice the measure of ∠KJH:
        * m(arc KH) = 2 * ∠KJH = 2 * (2*x - 27)° = (4*x - 54)°

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Understanding Center of Mass:** The center of mass of a body is the point where the entire mass of the body can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object, the center of mass lies at its geometric center.

* **Symmetry:** The given isosceles right triangle is symmetrical about the y-axis. Therefore, the center of mass will lie on the y-axis.

* **Dividing into Smaller Shapes:** We can divide the triangle into infinitesimally small horizontal strips of width 'dy' and length 'x'. The mass of each strip is proportional to its area, which is 'x * dy'.

* **Integrating to Find the Center of Mass:** To find the y-coordinate of the center of mass, we need to find the average y-coordinate of all the infinitesimally small strips. This can be done by integrating the product of the y-coordinate of each strip and its mass, and then dividing by the total mass of the triangle.

* **Finding the Length of the Strip:**  The length of each strip 'x' can be expressed in terms of 'y' using the equation of the line forming the hypotenuse of the triangle. Since the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, the equation of the hypotenuse is y = -x + a. Solving for x, we get x = a - y.

* **Setting up the Integral:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass (y_cm) can be calculated using the following integral:

    y_cm = (∫(y * x * dy) / ∫(x * dy)) from y = 0 to y = a

    where:
    * ∫(y * x * dy) represents the sum of the moments of each strip about the x-axis.
    * ∫(x * dy) represents the total mass of the triangle.

* **Evaluating the Integrals:**

    * ∫(y * x * dy) = ∫(y * (a - y) * dy) = (a * y^2 / 2 - y^3 / 3) from y = 0 to y = a = (a^3 / 2 - a^3 / 3) = a^3 / 6

* **Calculating the Center of Mass:**

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Understanding the Circuit:** The circuit consists of an infinite series of repeating units. Each unit comprises three resistors connected in parallel, with each of these parallel branches having two resistors in series.

* **Simplifying the Circuit:**
    * **Step 1:**  Let's focus on one repeating unit. The two resistors in series within each branch have a combined resistance of 2R (since they are in series, their resistances add up).
    * **Step 2:** Now, we have three branches, each with a resistance of 2R, connected in parallel. To find the equivalent resistance of parallel branches, we use the formula: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3. In this case, 1/R_total = 1/2R + 1/2R + 1/2R = 3/2R. Therefore, the equivalent resistance of one repeating unit is R_total = (2/3)R.

* **Infinite Chain:** Since the chain is infinitely long, we can consider the equivalent resistance of the entire chain as the resistance of one repeating unit plus the resistance of the rest of the infinite chain. This can be expressed as: R_total = (2/3)R + R_total.

* **Solving for R_total:**  Solving this equation for R_total, we get:
    * (1/3)R_total = (2/3)R

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Understanding Regular Hexagons**
    * A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles.
    * The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is (6-2) * 180° = 720°.
    * Therefore, each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures 720°/6 = 120°.

* **Step 2: Identifying Relevant Angles**
    * Angle ABO is half of angle ABC (since BO bisects angle ABC).
    * Therefore, angle ABO = 120°/2 = 60°.

* **Step 3: Applying Angle Properties**
    * The angles around point O form a complete circle, which measures 360°.
    * We know angle AOB = 120° (interior angle of the hexagon).
    * Therefore, angle x (angle BOE) = 360° - 120° - 60° - 60° = 120°.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Understanding the Geometry:** The diagram shows a triangle *DCE* inscribed in a circle.  A key property of inscribed triangles is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Identifying Intercepted Arcs:**
    * Angle *DCE* intercepts arc *DE*.
    * Angle *DEC* intercepts arc *DC*.

* **Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
    * Since angle *DCE* intercepts arc *DE*, we have:  *m*∠*DCE* = (1/2) *m*arc*DE*.
    * Since angle *DEC* intercepts arc *DC*, we have:  *m*∠*DEC* = (1/2) *m*arc*DC*.

* **Relating the Arcs:** The entire circle represents 360 degrees. Therefore, the measures of arc *DE* and arc *DC* must add up to 360 degrees: *m*arc*DE* + *m*arc*DC* = 360°.

* **Setting up the Equation:** We can now express the measures of the arcs in terms of the angles:
    * *m*arc*DE* = 2 *m*∠*DCE* = 2(5*x* - 12)
    * *m*arc*DC* = 2 *m*∠*DEC* = 2(3*x*)

    Substituting these into the equation for the entire circle:
    2(5*x* - 12) + 2(3*x*) = 360

* **Solving for *x*:**
    1. Distribute: 10*x* - 24 + 6*x* = 360
    2. Combine like terms: 16*x* - 24 = 360
    3. Add 24 to both sides: 16*x* = 384

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify Key Properties**
    * **Square:** All angles in a square are right angles (90 degrees).
    * **Tangent-Radius Property:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠CTT = 90 degrees.
    * **Semicircle:** An angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. Therefore, ∠CAD = 90 degrees.

* **Step 2: Analyze the Triangle**
    * We are interested in finding ∠CTD.  Notice that triangle CTD is a right triangle with ∠CDT = 90 degrees (since CD is a side of the square).

* **Step 3: Apply Angle Sum Property**
    * The sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle CTD:
        ∠CTD + ∠CDT + ∠TCD = 180 degrees
        ∠CTD + 90 degrees + ∠TCD = 180 degrees

* **Step 4: Find ∠TCD**
    * ∠TCD is the same as ∠ACD - ∠ACT.
    * ∠ACD = 90 degrees (angle of the square).
    * ∠ACT = 90 degrees - ∠CTT = 90 degrees - 90 degrees = 0 degrees (tangent-radius property).
    * Therefore, ∠TCD = 90 degrees - 0 degrees = 90 degrees.

* **Step 5: Calculate ∠CTD**
    * Substitute the value of ∠TCD into the equation from Step 3:
        ∠CTD + 90 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees

757,Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.,7.2,"**1. Problem:** Find the length of segment *x* in the given diagram, where a circle is intersected by two secants.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Understanding the Theorem:** We will use the Secant-Secant Theorem, which states that when two secants intersect outside a circle, the product of the external segment of one secant and its whole length is equal to the product of the external segment of the other secant and its whole length.

* **Applying the Theorem:**
    *  Let's label the external segment of the secant with length 15 as *a* (a = 15).
    *  The whole length of this secant is *a* + 15 = 30.
    *  The external segment of the secant with length *x* is *x*.
    *  The whole length of this secant is *x* + 8.

    Applying the Secant-Secant Theorem:
    * a(a + 15) = x(x + 8)

* **Solving the Equation:**
    * 15(30) = x(x + 8)
    * 450 = x² + 8x
    * 0 = x² + 8x - 450

    We now have a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
    * x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
    * Where a = 1, b = 8, and c = -450

    Substituting the values:
    * x = (-8 ± √(8² - 4 * 1 * -450)) / 2 * 1
    * x = (-8 ± √(1864)) / 2
    * x = (-8 ± 43.16) / 2

    We get two possible solutions:
    * x = 17.58
    * x = -25.58

* **Choosing the Valid Solution:** Since length cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
    * Since AB is the diameter, ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the entire circle. Therefore, ∠ACB is a right angle (90°).
    * ∠ABD and ∠ACD are both inscribed angles that intercept the same arc AD.  Inscribed angles that intercept the same arc are congruent.

* **Step 2: Apply the angle relationships.**
    * Since ∠ABD = 50°, and ∠ABD ≅ ∠ACD, then ∠ACD = 50°.

* **Step 3: Use the angle sum property of triangles.**
    * In triangle ACD, we have ∠ACD = 50° and ∠CAD = 90°.
    * The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. Therefore, ∠CDA = 180° - 50° - 90° = 40°.

* **Step 4: Apply the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.**
    * ∠BCD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CD. ∠BOD is the central angle that intercepts the same arc CD.
    * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc. Therefore, ∠BOD = 2 * ∠BCD.

* **Step 5: Use the angle sum property of quadrilaterals.**
    * Quadrilateral ABCD is cyclic (all its vertices lie on the circle). The sum of opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral is 180°.
    * Therefore, ∠BCD + ∠BAD = 180°.
    * We know ∠BAD = ∠ABD + ∠ADB = 50° + 40° = 90°.
    * So, ∠BCD + 90° = 180°.

In the given triangle ABC, F is the intersection point of angle bisectors CD and BE. CG is perpendicular to AB at point G. If ∠ACG = 32°, find the measure of ∠BFC.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
    * We know ∠ACG = 32°.
    * Since CG is perpendicular to AB, ∠CGA = 90°.
    * In triangle ACG, the sum of angles is 180°, so ∠CAG = 180° - ∠ACG - ∠CGA = 180° - 32° - 90° = 58°.
    * CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, so ∠ACD = ∠BCD.
    * BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, so ∠ABE = ∠CBE.

* **Step 2: Apply angle properties.**
    * In triangle ACF, ∠CAF + ∠ACF + ∠CFA = 180°.
    * We know ∠CAF = 58° and ∠ACF = ∠ACD = 1/2 ∠ACB.
    * Therefore, ∠CFA = 180° - 58° - 1/2 ∠ACB.

* **Step 3: Utilize the angle bisector property.**
    * In triangle BCF, ∠CBF + ∠BCF + ∠BFC = 180°.
    * We know ∠CBF = ∠CBE = 1/2 ∠ABC and ∠BCF = ∠BCD = 1/2 ∠ACB.
    * Therefore, ∠BFC = 180° - 1/2 ∠ABC - 1/2 ∠ACB.

* **Step 4: Combine and simplify.**
    * We know ∠CFA = 180° - 58° - 1/2 ∠ACB and ∠BFC = 180° - 1/2 ∠ABC - 1/2 ∠ACB.
    * Since ∠CFA and ∠BFC are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), their sum is 180°.
    * Therefore, (180° - 58° - 1/2 ∠ACB) + (180° - 1/2 ∠ABC - 1/2 ∠ACB) = 180°.
    * Simplifying, we get 302° - 1/2 ∠ABC - ∠ACB = 180°.
    * Rearranging, we get 1/2 ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 122°.

* **Step 5: Solve for ∠BFC.**
    * We know ∠BFC = 180° - 1/2 ∠ABC - 1/2 ∠ACB.

* **Step 1: Understanding Regular Polygons and Central Angles**
    * A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal.
    * The central angle of a regular polygon is formed by connecting the center of the polygon to two consecutive vertices. The measure of each central angle is found by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides of the polygon.

* **Step 2: Calculating the Central Angle of the Pentagon**
    * The pentagon has 5 sides.
    * The central angle, ∠AOB (or any other central angle), measures 360 degrees / 5 sides = 72 degrees.

* **Step 3: Relating Central Angle to Inscribed Angle**
    * ∠ADE is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as the central angle ∠AOB.
    * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Step 4: Finding the Measure of ∠ADE**
    * Since ∠ADE intercepts the same arc as ∠AOB, its measure is half of ∠AOB.
