643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. **Problem:**
   * In a circle with center O, CD is the diameter, chord DE is parallel to chord OA, and the measure of angle D is 50 degrees. Find the measure of angle C.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify relevant angles and relationships.
      * Since CD is a diameter, angle COD is a straight angle, measuring 180 degrees.
      * Angle CDO is half of angle COD because it is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc as angle COD. Therefore, angle CDO = 180/2 = 90 degrees.
      * Angle DOE is supplementary to angle CDO, so angle DOE = 180 - 90 = 90 degrees.
      * Angle DEA is equal to angle CDO because they are corresponding angles formed by parallel lines DE and OA. Therefore, angle DEA = 90 degrees.
      * Angle ADE is equal to angle D because they are alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines DE and OA. Therefore, angle ADE = 50 degrees.

   * **Step 2:** Apply the angle sum property of triangles.
      * In triangle CDE, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle C + angle D + angle E = 180 degrees.
      * Substituting the known values, we get angle C + 50 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees.

   * **Step 3:** Solve for angle C.
      * Combining like terms, we get angle C + 140 degrees = 180 degrees.
      * Subtracting 140 degrees from both sides, we get angle C = 40 degrees.

3. **Final Answer:**
   * The degree of angle C is **40 degrees**.

   * **Step 3: Solve for *h*.**
      * We know that cos(60°) = 1/2.
      * 1/2 = 4 / *h*

   * In the given figure, triangle ABC is inscribed in circle O. If angle ABC is 70 degrees, find the measure of angle AOC.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant theorem.
      * The theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the theorem to angle ABC.
      * Angle ABC intercepts arc AC. Therefore, the measure of arc AC is twice the measure of angle ABC, which is 2 * 70 degrees = 140 degrees.
   * **Step 3:** Relate angle AOC to arc AC.
      * Angle AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc AC as angle ABC.
   * **Step 4:** Apply the theorem for central angles.
      * The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, the measure of angle AOC is equal to the measure of arc AC, which is 140 degrees.

In the given figure, lines AB and CD intersect at point O. Ray OE bisects ∠BOC. If ∠AOD = 70°, find the measure of ∠AOE.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relevant angles:** We are given ∠AOD = 70° and need to find ∠AOE. Notice that ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles (they form a straight line).

2. **Calculate ∠BOD:** Since supplementary angles add up to 180°, we have:
   ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.

3. **Understand angle bisection:** Ray OE bisects ∠BOC, meaning it divides ∠BOC into two equal angles: ∠BOE and ∠COE.

4. **Relate ∠BOD and ∠BOC:** Observe that ∠BOD and ∠BOC are adjacent angles (they share a common side and vertex). Therefore, ∠BOD + ∠BOC = 180°.

5. **Calculate ∠BOC:** Using the information from step 4, we get:
   ∠BOC = 180° - ∠BOD = 180° - 110° = 70°.

* q3 = -200 nC
* q4 = 200 nC

The distance 'a' is 5.0 cm. Determine the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the forces acting on particle 3:** Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to particles 1, 2, and 4. 

2. **Calculate the force due to particle 1:**
    * **Magnitude:** The force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's Law: F = k * |q1 * q3| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2), q1 and q3 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.
    * **Direction:** Since q1 and q3 have opposite signs, the force is attractive, directed along the diagonal of the square towards particle 1.
    * **x-component:** The x-component of this force is F13x = F13 * cos(45°) = (k * |q1 * q3| / (a√2)^2) * (1/√2).

3. **Calculate the force due to particle 2:**
    * **Magnitude:**  F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / a^2
    * **Direction:** Since q2 and q3 have opposite signs, the force is attractive, directed horizontally towards particle 2.
    * **x-component:** F23x = F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / a^2

4. **Calculate the force due to particle 4:**
    * **Magnitude:** F43 = k * |q4 * q3| / a^2
    * **Direction:** Since q4 and q3 have the same sign, the force is repulsive, directed horizontally away from particle 4.
    * **x-component:** F43x = -F43 = -k * |q4 * q3| / a^2

5. **Calculate the net x-component of the force:**
    * The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of the individual forces: Fnetx = F13x + F23x + F43x.

## Final Answer:

Substituting the given values and solving the equation, we get:

Fnetx = (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2 * |-100 * 10^-9 C * -200 * 10^-9 C| / (0.05 m * √2)^2) * (1/√2) + (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2 * |100 * 10^-9 C * -200 * 10^-9 C| / (0.05 m)^2) - (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2 * |200 * 10^-9 C * -200 * 10^-9 C| / (0.05 m)^2)

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Understand the properties of tangents.
      * Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.
      * The angle between a tangent and the radius drawn to the point of contact is 90 degrees. So, ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90 degrees.
   * **Step 2:** Analyze the triangles formed.
      * Triangles OAC and OBD are right-angled triangles.
      * Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal in length.
      * Therefore, triangles OAC and OBD are congruent by the Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) congruence theorem.
   * **Step 3:** Determine the lengths of AC and BD.

   * Find the length of segment $JQ$ in triangle $JLN$, given that $Q$ is the incenter of the triangle and $JL = 16.5$.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Understanding the Incenter:** The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. It is also the center of the inscribed circle of the triangle.
   * **Incenter Property:** The incenter of a triangle is equidistant from the sides of the triangle. This means that the distance from the incenter to each side is the same.
   * **Constructing the Inscribed Circle:** Draw the inscribed circle of triangle $JLN$ with center $Q$. The circle will be tangent to all three sides of the triangle.
   * **Right Triangles:** Notice that segments $JQ$, $QN$, and $QP$ are radii of the inscribed circle and are therefore equal in length. Also, triangles $JQP$, $QNP$, and $QLM$ are right triangles.
   * **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $JQ$. In right triangle $JQP$, we have:
      * $JQ^2 = JP^2 + QP^2$
   * **Finding JP:** Since $JL = 16.5$ and $JP$ is a segment of $JL$, we need to find the length of $JP$. We can do this by using the fact that the incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle. Let $x$ be the distance from $Q$ to each side of the triangle. Then, $JP = JL - x$.
   * **Finding x:** We can find $x$ by using the right triangle $QLM$. We know that $QM = x$ and $LM = 9$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
      * $LM^2 = QM^2 + QL^2$
      * $9^2 = x^2 + QL^2$
      * $QL^2 = 81 - x^2$
   * **Finding QL:** Since $QL$ is also a radius of the inscribed circle, we have $QL = QP = x$.
   * **Substituting and Solving:** Substituting $QL = x$ into the equation $QL^2 = 81 - x^2$, we get:
      * $x^2 = 81 - x^2$
      * $2x^2 = 81$

      * $x = \sqrt{40.5}$
   * **Finding JP:** Now we can find $JP$:

   * **Finding JQ:** Finally, we can find $JQ$ using the Pythagorean theorem:
      * $JQ^2 = JP^2 + QP^2$

1. **Understanding the Perpendicular Bisector:** The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line that is perpendicular to the segment and passes through its midpoint. This means that AD = DB = 3.

2. **Using the Perimeter Information:** We know that the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, which means AC + CE + AE = 13.

3. **Applying the Triangle Inequality:**  The Triangle Inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Applying this to triangle ABE, we have: AB + BE > AE. Since AB = 6, we can write: 6 + BE > AE.

4. **Combining Information:**  We can substitute BE = BC - CE into the inequality from step 3: 6 + BC - CE > AE.  Rearranging, we get: BC + 6 > AE + CE.

5. **Substituting Perimeter:**  We know that AC + CE + AE = 13.  Substituting this into the inequality from step 4, we get: BC + 6 > 13.  Therefore, BC > 7.

6. **Calculating the Perimeter of Triangle ABC:** The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC. We know AB = 6 and AC + CE + AE = 13. Since BC > 7, the perimeter of triangle ABC is greater than 6 + 7 + 13 = 26.

## Final Answer:

The perimeter of triangle ABC is greater than 26.

In parallelogram ABCD, the angle bisector of ∠ABC intersects AD at point E, and the angle bisector of ∠BCD intersects AD at point F. If AB = 3 and AD = 4, find the length of EF.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Properties of Parallelograms:**
   * Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel. Therefore, AB = CD = 3 and AD = BC = 4.
   * Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal. Therefore, ∠ABC = ∠ADC and ∠BCD = ∠BAD.

2. **Angle Bisector Property:**
   * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Therefore, ∠ABE = ∠CBE and ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

3. **Using the Angle Bisector Property and Parallel Lines:**
   * Since AB || CD, we have ∠ABE = ∠CED (alternate interior angles).
   * Similarly, ∠BCF = ∠EFD (alternate interior angles).
   * Combining these with the angle bisector property, we get ∠CED = ∠CBE and ∠EFD = ∠DCF.

4. **Identifying Similar Triangles:**
   * From the above observations, we can see that ΔCBE ~ ΔCED and ΔDCF ~ ΔEFD.

5. **Using Proportions in Similar Triangles:**
   * Since ΔCBE ~ ΔCED, we have CE/CD = BE/BC.
   * Since ΔDCF ~ ΔEFD, we have DF/DE = CF/CD.

6. **Solving for CE and DF:**
   * From the above proportions, we can write CE = (CD * BE)/BC and DF = (DE * CF)/CD.

7. **Using the Given Information:**
   * We know AB = 3, AD = 4, and BC = 4.
   * Since AE + ED = AD = 4, we can write ED = 4 - AE.
   * Similarly, AF + FD = AD = 4, so FD = 4 - AF.

8. **Substituting and Solving for EF:**
   * Substituting the values and expressions we found into the equations for CE and DF, we get:
      * CE = (3 * BE)/4
      * DF = (4 - AE) * CF / 3
   * Since EF = CE + DF, we can substitute the expressions for CE and DF and simplify:
      * EF = (3 * BE)/4 + (4 - AE) * CF / 3

9. **Using the Angle Bisector Theorem:**
   * The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the sides of a triangle adjacent to the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the opposite sides.
   * Applying this to ΔABC, we get BE/AE = BC/AB = 4/3.
   * Applying this to ΔBCD, we get CF/DF = BC/CD = 4/3.

10. **Solving for BE and CF:**
   * From the above ratios, we can write BE = (4/3) * AE and CF = (4/3) * DF.

11. **Substituting and Solving for EF:**
   * Substituting the expressions for BE and CF into the equation for EF, we get:
      * EF = (3 * (4/3) * AE)/4 + (4 - AE) * (4/3) * (4 - AF) / 3
      * Simplifying, we get EF = AE + (16/9) * (4 - AE) * (4 - AF)

12. **Using the Fact that AE + AF = AD = 4:**
   * Substituting AF = 4 - AE into the equation for EF, we get:
      * EF = AE + (16/9) * (4 - AE) * (4 - (4 - AE))
      * Simplifying, we get EF = AE + (16/9) * AE * (4 - AE)

13. **Expanding and Solving for EF:**
   * Expanding the equation, we get EF = AE + (64/9) * AE - (16/9) * AE^2.
   * Rearranging, we get (16/9) * AE^2 - (73/9) * AE + EF = 0.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ABC:**
   * AC² + BC² = AB²
   * AC² + BC² = 10² = 100

3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle CDB:**
   * CD² + DB² = BC²
   * CD² + 5² = BC²
   * CD² = BC² - 25

   * In the given figure, PA and PB are tangents to circle O, with points A and B as the points of tangency. AC is the diameter of circle O. Given that ∠P = 50°, find the measure of ∠ACB.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Understand the properties of tangents.
      * Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB.
      * The angle between a tangent and the radius drawn to the point of tangency is 90°. So, ∠OAB = ∠OBA = 90°.
   * **Step 2:** Analyze the triangle PAB.
      * Since PA = PB, triangle PAB is an isosceles triangle.
      * In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. Therefore, ∠PAB = ∠PBA.
      * The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. So, ∠PAB + ∠PBA + ∠P = 180°.
      * Substituting ∠P = 50° and ∠PAB = ∠PBA, we get 2∠PAB + 50° = 180°.
      * Solving for ∠PAB, we get ∠PAB = ∠PBA = 65°.
   * **Step 3:** Analyze the triangle OAB.
      * We know ∠OAB = ∠OBA = 90° and ∠PAB = ∠PBA = 65°.
      * Therefore, ∠AOB = 180° - ∠OAB - ∠OBA = 180° - 90° - 90° = 0°.
   * **Step 4:** Analyze the triangle ACB.
      * Since AC is the diameter of the circle, ∠ACB is an inscribed angle subtending the diameter.
      * An inscribed angle subtending a diameter is always a right angle. Therefore, ∠ACB = 90°.

In triangle ABC, AD bisects angle BAC and intersects BC at point D. DE is perpendicular to AB, with E as the foot of the perpendicular. Given DE = 3 and AC = 4, find the area of triangle ADC.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a triangle ABC with an angle bisector AD. We need to find the area of triangle ADC, given the length of DE and AC.

2. **Using the Angle Bisector Theorem:** Since AD bisects angle BAC, we can apply the Angle Bisector Theorem. This theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the side opposite the bisected angle is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides. In our case, this means:

   BD/DC = AB/AC

3. **Finding AB:** We know DE = 3 and DE is perpendicular to AB. Therefore, triangle ADE is a right triangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find AB:

   AB² = AD² + DE² = AD² + 3²

4. **Finding AD:** We can use the fact that DE is the altitude of triangle ABC from point D. The area of a triangle is given by:

   Area = (1/2) * base * height

   Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is:

   Area(ABC) = (1/2) * BC * DE = (1/2) * (BD + DC) * 3

   Also, the area of triangle ABC can be expressed as the sum of the areas of triangles ABD and ADC:

   Area(ABC) = Area(ABD) + Area(ADC)

   Area(ABC) = (1/2) * AB * DE + (1/2) * AC * DE

   Substituting the values we know:

   (1/2) * (BD + DC) * 3 = (1/2) * (AD² + 3²) * 3 + (1/2) * 4 * 3

   Simplifying the equation:

   (BD + DC) = (AD² + 9) + 4

   BD + DC = AD² + 13

5. **Solving for AD:** We can now substitute the value of BD + DC from the Angle Bisector Theorem into the equation we derived in step 4:

   (AB/AC) * DC + DC = AD² + 13

   Substituting AB from step 3:

   ((AD² + 9)/4) * DC + DC = AD² + 13

   Simplifying the equation:

   (AD² + 9) * DC + 4DC = 4AD² + 52

   (AD² + 13) * DC = 4AD² + 52

   DC = (4AD² + 52) / (AD² + 13)

1. **Identify relevant angles:** We are given ∠D = 35° and ∠AEC = 105°. We need to find ∠C.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  ∠D is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC. Therefore, the measure of arc AC is 2 * ∠D = 2 * 35° = 70°.

3. **Apply the Central Angle Theorem:** The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. ∠AEC is a central angle intercepting arc AC. Therefore, ∠AEC = measure of arc AC = 70°.

4. **Find ∠CEB:**  We know ∠AEC = 105° and ∠CEB is a part of it. Therefore, ∠CEB = ∠AEC - ∠AEB = 105° - 70° = 35°.

5. **Apply the Angle Sum Property of Triangles:** In triangle CEB, the sum of all angles is 180°. Therefore, ∠C + ∠CEB + ∠EBC = 180°. We know ∠CEB = 35° and ∠EBC = ∠D = 35°. Substituting these values, we get ∠C + 35° + 35° = 180°.

6. **Solve for ∠C:** Simplifying the equation, we get ∠C + 70° = 180°. Subtracting 70° from both sides, we get ∠C = 180° - 70° = 110°.

      * Angle AOB is a central angle intercepting arc AB. Therefore, its measure is equal to the measure of arc AB, which is 50 degrees.

      * Since AO is parallel to BC, we know that angle AOB and angle BOC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees).
      * Since A, B, and C lie on the circle, we know that angle AOC is a central angle, and angle ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as angle AOC.

   * **Step 2:** Calculate angle BOC.
      * We know that angle AOB = 40 degrees, and angle AOB + angle BOC = 180 degrees.

In the given figure, E and F are the midpoints of sides AB and AD respectively of rhombus ABCD. If AB = 5 and AC = 6, find the length of EF.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Properties of a Rhombus:**
   * A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal.
   * The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.

2. **Identifying Key Triangles:**
   * Focus on triangle AEF. Since E and F are midpoints, AE = EB and AF = FD.
   * Also, since AC is a diagonal of the rhombus, it bisects angle A, making angle EAF = angle FAB.

3. **Applying the Midpoint Theorem:**
   * The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
   * Therefore, EF is parallel to BD and EF = 1/2 BD.

4. **Finding BD:**
   * Since AC and BD are diagonals of the rhombus, they bisect each other at right angles.
   * Therefore, triangle AOB is a right-angled triangle with AO = AC/2 = 3 and AB = 5.
   * Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find BO: BO² = AB² - AO² = 5² - 3² = 16.
   * Therefore, BO = 4 and BD = 2 * BO = 8.

     * We are given a quadrilateral with specific angle measures. We need to find points M and N on two sides of the quadrilateral such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized. Then, we need to find the sum of two angles in this triangle.
   * **Step 2: Apply the concept of reflection.**
     * Reflect point A across line BC to get point A'. Similarly, reflect point A across line CD to get point A''.
     * Now, consider triangle A'MN. Since A' is the reflection of A across BC, AM = A'M. Similarly, AN = A''N.
     * Therefore, the perimeter of triangle AMN is equal to the perimeter of triangle A'MN.
   * **Step 3: Minimize the perimeter of triangle A'MN.**
     * The perimeter of triangle A'MN is minimized when points A', M, and N are collinear. This is because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
   * **Step 4: Analyze the angles.**
     * Since A' is the reflection of A across BC, ∠A'BM = ∠ABM. Similarly, ∠A''DN = ∠ADN.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1: Identify corresponding angles.**
      * The angles labeled 2x + 6 and -3/5y + 2 are corresponding angles because they occupy the same relative position at the intersection of the transversal and each parallel line.
   * **Step 2: Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate.**
      * The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that when parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are congruent (equal in measure).
   * **Step 3: Set up an equation.**
      * Since the corresponding angles are congruent, we can set their expressions equal to each other: 2x + 6 = -3/5y + 2.
   * **Step 4: Solve for y.**
      * We need to isolate y in the equation. However, we also have x in the equation. To solve for y, we need to eliminate x.

Given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees, find the measure of angle E.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Congruent Triangles:** Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle E is equal to angle B.

2. **Angle Bisector:** CD bisects angle BCA, meaning angle BCD is equal to angle ACD.

3. **Angle Sum Property:** The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Applying this to triangle ABC, we have: angle A + angle B + angle C = 180 degrees.

4. **Finding Angle C:**  We know angle A is 22 degrees. Since CD bisects angle C, we can find angle BCD (or ACD) by subtracting angle A from 180 degrees and dividing by 2: (180 - 22) / 2 = 79 degrees.

   * Find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of an isosceles right triangle with sides of length 'a' and uniform areal density.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1: Understand the Concept of Center of Mass**
      * The center of mass of an object is the point where the entire mass of the object can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object, the center of mass lies at its geometric center.
   * **Step 2: Divide the Triangle into Smaller Parts**
      * Imagine dividing the triangle into infinitesimally small horizontal strips. Each strip can be considered as a thin rectangle with a small mass 'dm'.
   * **Step 3: Determine the Mass of Each Strip**
      * The mass of each strip is proportional to its area. Let the width of each strip be 'dx' and its distance from the base of the triangle be 'y'. The length of the strip at a distance 'y' from the base is (a - 2y) (using similar triangles).
      * Therefore, the area of the strip is dA = (a - 2y) dx.
      * The mass of the strip is dm = σ dA = σ (a - 2y) dx, where σ is the areal density.
   * **Step 4: Calculate the Moment of Each Strip**
      * The moment of each strip about the x-axis is dM = y dm = y σ (a - 2y) dx.
   * **Step 5: Integrate to Find the Total Moment**
      * To find the total moment (M) of the triangle, we need to integrate the moment of each strip over the entire height of the triangle (from y = 0 to y = a/2):
      * M = ∫(0 to a/2) y σ (a - 2y) dx = σ ∫(0 to a/2) (ay - 2y²) dx
      * M = σ [ay²/2 - (2/3)y³] (from 0 to a/2)
      * M = σ [(a³/8) - (a³/12)] = σ (a³/24)
   * **Step 6: Calculate the Total Mass**
      * The total mass (m) of the triangle is the integral of the mass of each strip over the entire height:
      * m = ∫(0 to a/2) σ (a - 2y) dx = σ ∫(0 to a/2) (a - 2y) dx
      * m = σ [ax - y²] (from 0 to a/2)
      * m = σ [(a²/2) - (a²/4)] = σ (a²/4)
   * **Step 7: Determine the y-coordinate of the Center of Mass**
      * The y-coordinate of the center of mass (y_cm) is given by the ratio of the total moment to the total mass:
      * y_cm = M/m = (σ (a³/24)) / (σ (a²/4)) = a/6

   * **Step 3:  Solve the quadratic equation.**
      * Rearrange the equation: x² + x - 110 = 0
      * Factor the quadratic equation: (x + 11)(x - 10) = 0
      * Solve for x: x = -11 or x = 10
      * Since angles cannot be negative, we discard x = -11.

   * **Step 4:  Calculate the value of y.**
      * We know y = x² and x = 10.
      * Substitute x = 10 into the equation: y = 10² = 100

3. **Final Answer:**
   * The value of y is **100**.
