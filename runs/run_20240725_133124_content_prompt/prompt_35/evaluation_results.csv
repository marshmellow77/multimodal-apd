643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"**1. Problem:**

We have a circle with a diameter CD and a chord DE that is parallel to another chord OA. We know that angle D is 50 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle C.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships**

   * Since CD is the diameter of the circle, we know that angle COD is a straight angle, meaning it measures 180 degrees.
   * Because DE is parallel to OA, we know that angle D and angle A are corresponding angles, and therefore they are equal. So, angle A also measures 50 degrees.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**

   * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. 
   * In our case, angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AD. 
   * Angle COD is a central angle that also intercepts arc AD.

* **Step 3: Calculate the measure of arc AD**

   * Since angle COD is a straight angle (180 degrees), and it intercepts arc AD, the measure of arc AD is also 180 degrees.

* **Step 4: Calculate the measure of angle C**

   * Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we know that angle C is half the measure of arc AD. 
   * Therefore, angle C = (1/2) * 180 degrees = 90 degrees.

**3. Answer:**

The degree of angle C is 90 degrees.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"**1. Problem:**

We have a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees and one side measuring 4 units. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is labeled as 'h'.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio to use.** 
    * We know the length of the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle (4 units) and we want to find the hypotenuse. 
    * The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is the cosine. 
    * The cosine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse:  cos(angle) = adjacent / hypotenuse.

* **Step 2: Write down the equation using the cosine ratio.**
    * In this case, we have: cos(60°) = 4 / h

* **Step 3: Solve for 'h'.**
    * We know that cos(60°) = 1/2 (you can find this value in a trigonometric table or using a calculator).
    * Substitute this value into the equation: 1/2 = 4 / h
    * Multiply both sides of the equation by 'h': h/2 = 4
    * Multiply both sides of the equation by 2: h = 8

**3. Answer:**

The length of the hypotenuse, 'h', is 8 units.

887,"As shown in the figure, △ABC is the inscribed triangle of ⊙O. If ∠ABC = 70.0, then the degree of ∠AOC is equal to ()",140°,"**1. Problem:**

We have a circle with center O and a triangle ABC inscribed inside it. We know that angle ABC (the angle at point B) is 70 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle AOC (the angle at the center of the circle formed by points A, O, and C).

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between the inscribed angle and the central angle.**

   * In a circle, the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc. 
   * In this case, angle ABC is an inscribed angle, and angle AOC is a central angle, both intercepting the same arc AC.

* **Step 2: Apply the relationship to find the measure of angle AOC.**

   * Since angle ABC is 70 degrees, and angle AOC is twice the measure of angle ABC, we can calculate angle AOC as follows:
      * Angle AOC = 2 * Angle ABC
      * Angle AOC = 2 * 70 degrees
      * Angle AOC = 140 degrees

318,Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.,2256,"**1. Problem:**

We need to find the area of the figure.  The figure is a trapezoid, which is a four-sided shape with two parallel sides.  To find the area of a trapezoid, we need to figure out how much space it takes up.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the bases and height.**
   * The bases of a trapezoid are the two parallel sides. In this case, the bases are 41 ft and 53 ft.
   * The height of a trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between the bases. In this case, the height is 48 ft.

* **Step 2: Apply the formula for the area of a trapezoid.**
   * The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:  Area = (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2)
   * This formula tells us to multiply half of the height by the sum of the two bases.

* **Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula.**
   * Area = (1/2) * 48 ft * (41 ft + 53 ft)

* **Step 4: Simplify the expression.**

We need to figure out the missing number in the last triangle. To do this, we need to find a pattern or rule that connects the numbers in each triangle.

**2. Solution:**

Let's look at the first triangle:

We have two lines, AB and CD, that intersect at point O.  A third line, OE, splits the angle BOC into two equal parts. We know that angle AOD is 70 degrees.  Our goal is to figure out the size of angle AOE.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Find the size of angle BOD.**

   * We know that angles AOD and BOD are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. 
   * So, we can find the size of angle BOD by subtracting the size of angle AOD from 180 degrees: 
      * BOD = 180° - AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°

* **Step 2: Find the size of angle BOC.**

   * Angles BOD and BOC are also supplementary angles.
   * We can find the size of angle BOC by subtracting the size of angle BOD from 180 degrees:
      * BOC = 180° - BOD = 180° - 110° = 70°

* **Step 3: Find the size of angle COE.**

   * We know that OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides it into two equal angles.
   * Therefore, angle COE is half the size of angle BOC:
      * COE = BOC / 2 = 70° / 2 = 35°

* **Step 4: Find the size of angle AOE.**

   * Angles AOD and COE are adjacent angles, meaning they share a common side (OD).
   * We can find the size of angle AOE by adding the sizes of angles AOD and COE:
      * AOE = AOD + COE = 70° + 35° = 105°

We need to find the horizontal force acting on particle 3 due to the other three particles. This force is called the ""x component"" of the net electrostatic force because it acts along the horizontal (x) axis.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**

   * Particle 1 exerts a repulsive force on particle 3 because they have opposite charges. This force acts diagonally upwards and to the left.
   * Particle 2 exerts an attractive force on particle 3 because they have opposite charges. This force acts diagonally downwards and to the right.
   * Particle 4 exerts a repulsive force on particle 3 because they have the same charge. This force acts horizontally to the right.

* **Step 2: Break down the diagonal forces into their x and y components.**

   * We are only interested in the x component of the force, so we need to find the horizontal component of the forces from particles 1 and 2.
   * Imagine a right triangle where the diagonal force is the hypotenuse, and the x component is one of the legs.
   * We can use trigonometry to find the x component:  
      * **x component = diagonal force * cos(angle)**
      * The angle is the angle between the diagonal force and the horizontal axis.

* **Step 3: Calculate the magnitude of each force using Coulomb's Law.**

   * Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
   * **Formula:** F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
      * F is the force
      * k is Coulomb's constant (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
      * q1 and q2 are the charges
      * r is the distance between the charges

* **Step 4: Calculate the x component of the forces from particles 1 and 2.**

   * Use the formula from Step 2 and the magnitudes of the forces calculated in Step 3.
   * The angle for both forces is 45 degrees because the diagonal forces form a 45-45-90 triangle.
   * **x component = diagonal force * cos(45°)**

* **Step 5: Add up all the x components to find the net x component of the force.**

   * The x component of the force from particle 1 is negative because it acts to the left.
   * The x component of the force from particle 2 is positive because it acts to the right.
   * The x component of the force from particle 4 is positive because it acts to the right.

**3. Answer:**

The x component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is approximately **1.44 N** to the right.

We are given that the measure of angle 1 is 123 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 14.  

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles 1 and 14.**
   * Angles 1 and 14 are **corresponding angles**. Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal line intersects two parallel lines. They are located in the same relative position at each intersection. 
* **Step 2: Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate.**
   * The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the corresponding angles are congruent (meaning they have the same measure).
* **Step 3: Determine the measure of angle 14.**
   * Since angle 1 and angle 14 are corresponding angles, and angle 1 measures 123 degrees, then angle 14 also measures **123 degrees**.

We have a right triangle, and we know the lengths of two sides. We need to find the measure of angle J, which is one of the acute angles in the triangle. 

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio to use.**
    * We know the lengths of the opposite side (9) and the hypotenuse (14) with respect to angle J. 
    * The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function:  sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse.

* **Step 2: Set up the equation.**
    * We know sin(J) = 9/14.

* **Step 3: Use the inverse sine function (arcsin) to find the angle.**
    * The inverse sine function (arcsin) is the opposite of the sine function. It takes a sine value and gives us the angle.
    * So, J = arcsin(9/14).

* **Step 4: Use a calculator to find the value of arcsin(9/14).**

We have a right triangle ABC, where point D is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC. We need to find the length of AD.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the key information.**
   * We know that the grid is a 4x4 square, meaning each side of the square has a length of 4 units.
   * We can see that AB has a length of 4 units (it spans 4 squares vertically) and BC has a length of 3 units (it spans 3 squares horizontally).

* **Step 2: Recognize the Pythagorean Theorem.**
   * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  
   * In our triangle ABC, AB is the hypotenuse, and BC and AC are the other two sides.

* **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find AC.**
   * We know AB = 4 and BC = 3.  Let's use the Pythagorean Theorem to find AC:
      * AB² = BC² + AC²
      * 4² = 3² + AC²
      * 16 = 9 + AC²
      * AC² = 16 - 9 = 7
      * AC = √7

* **Step 4: Recognize that triangle ADC is also a right triangle.**
   * We know that AD is perpendicular to BC, so angle ADC is a right angle.

* **Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem again to find AD.**
   * Now we have a right triangle ADC, where AC is the hypotenuse, and AD and DC are the other two sides.
   * We know AC = √7.  We also know that DC is 2 units long (it spans 2 squares horizontally).  Let's use the Pythagorean Theorem to find AD:
      * AC² = AD² + DC²
      * (√7)² = AD² + 2²

We are given a circle with center O, and two tangents PA and PB drawn from an external point P.  Points C and D are moving points on PA and PB respectively, such that CD is always tangent to the circle. We know PA = 8.0, and we need to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the properties of tangents.**

   * **Key Property:**  Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. This means PA = PB = 8.0.

* **Step 2:  Identify key relationships.**

   * **Key Relationship:**  Since CD is tangent to the circle, it forms a right angle with the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OCD and ∠ODC are right angles.

* **Step 3:  Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.**

   * **Pythagorean Theorem:** In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. 
   * **Applying it:** In right triangle OCD, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of CD:
      * CD² = OC² + OD²
      * Since OC and OD are radii of the circle, they are equal. Let's call this length 'r'.
      * CD² = r² + r² = 2r²
      * CD = √(2r²) = r√2

* **Step 4:  Calculate the perimeter of triangle PCD.**

   * **Perimeter:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
   * **Perimeter of △PCD:** PC + CD + PD = PA - AC + CD + PB - BD = PA + PB + CD - (AC + BD)
   * **Simplifying:** Since AC = BD (tangents from the same point), the perimeter becomes: 8.0 + 8.0 + r√2 - (AC + AC) = 16 + r√2 - 2AC

* **Step 5:  Recognize the relationship between AC and r.**

   * **Key Relationship:**  Triangle OAC is a right triangle (∠OAC is a right angle).
   * **Applying it:** Using the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle OAC:
      * AC² = OA² + OC² = r² + r² = 2r²
      * AC = √(2r²) = r√2

* **Step 6:  Substitute and simplify.**

   * **Substituting AC:** The perimeter of △PCD becomes 16 + r√2 - 2(r√2) = 16 - r√2

* **Step 7:  Express the answer in terms of PA.**

   * **Key Relationship:**  We know PA = 8.0, and we also know PA = PB = 2r (since PA and PB are tangents).
   * **Solving for r:**  r = PA/2 = 8.0/2 = 4.0

* **Step 8:  Calculate the final answer.**

   * **Substituting r:** The perimeter of △PCD = 16 - r√2 = 16 - 4√2

We are given a triangle ABC with a point D inside it. We know that CD bisects angle ACB, BD is perpendicular to CD, angle A is equal to angle ABD, and angle DBC is 54 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle A.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Find angle BCD.** Since CD bisects angle ACB, we know that angle BCD is half of angle ACB.  We can write this as: 
   *  ∠BCD = 1/2 * ∠ACB

* **Step 2: Find angle BDC.** We know that BD is perpendicular to CD, which means angle BDC is a right angle (90 degrees).

* **Step 3: Find angle CBD.** We know that the angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  So, in triangle BCD:
   * ∠BCD + ∠BDC + ∠CBD = 180°
   * We know ∠BDC = 90° and ∠DBC = 54°.  Substituting these values:
   * ∠BCD + 90° + 54° = 180°
   * Simplifying:
   * ∠BCD = 180° - 90° - 54° = 36°

* **Step 4: Find angle ACB.** Since ∠BCD = 1/2 * ∠ACB, we can find ∠ACB by doubling ∠BCD:
   * ∠ACB = 2 * ∠BCD = 2 * 36° = 72°

* **Step 5: Find angle ABC.**  We know that the angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So, in triangle ABC:
   * ∠A + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°
   * We know ∠ACB = 72° and ∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠DBC = ∠A + 54° (because ∠A = ∠ABD). Substituting these values:
   * ∠A + (∠A + 54°) + 72° = 180°

* **Step 6: Solve for angle A.** Simplifying the equation from Step 5:
   * 2∠A + 126° = 180°

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between the areas of triangles ABE and ABC.**

   * Since E is the midpoint of AD, line segment AE is half the length of AD. 
   * Also, the height of triangle ABE (the perpendicular distance from point E to line segment AB) is the same as the height of triangle ABC (the perpendicular distance from point D to line segment AB).

* **Step 2: Apply the formula for the area of a triangle.**

   * The area of a triangle is calculated as (1/2) * base * height. 
   * In triangle ABE, the base is AE and the height is the same as the height of triangle ABC.
   * In triangle ABC, the base is AD (which is twice the length of AE) and the height is the same as the height of triangle ABE.

* **Step 3: Calculate the area of triangle ABC.**

   * Since the height is the same for both triangles, the ratio of their areas is directly proportional to the ratio of their bases.
   * The base of triangle ABC (AD) is twice the length of the base of triangle ABE (AE).
   * Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle ABE.

* **Step 4: Substitute the known area of triangle ABE.**

**2. Solution:**

To find the missing side of a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs).

* **Step 1: Write down the Pythagorean theorem:**
   * a² + b² = c²
   * Where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.

* **Step 2: Substitute the known values into the equation:**
   * We know that a = 9 and c = 15. So, we can substitute these values into the equation:
      * 9² + b² = 15²

* **Step 3: Simplify the equation:**
   * 81 + b² = 225

* **Step 4: Isolate b² (which represents x² in our problem):**
   * Subtract 81 from both sides of the equation:

* **Step 3: Use the given information to find the value of x.** We know that the total distance from $Q'$ to $C$ is 15, and the distance from $Q$ to $C$ is 5.  Therefore, the distance from $Q'$ to $Q$ is 15 - 5 = 10.  Since $x$ represents the distance from $Q'$ to $C$, we know that x = 10 + 5 = 15.

    * This means that the incenter is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle.

* **Step 2: Draw the Inradius**
    * Draw a line segment from the incenter $Q$ to side $JL$, making sure it is perpendicular to $JL$. This line segment is called the inradius. 
    * Since the incenter is equidistant from all sides, the inradius will also be perpendicular to sides $LN$ and $NJ$.

* **Step 3: Identify Right Triangles**
    * We now have three right triangles: $\triangle JQP$, $\triangle QMN$, and $\triangle QKL$.

* **Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**
    * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. 
    * We can use this theorem to find the length of the inradius, which is a leg of each of the right triangles.

* **Step 5: Find the Inradius**
    * Let's focus on $\triangle QMN$. We know that $QM$ is the inradius and $MN$ is 9. We need to find $QN$.
    * Since $Q$ is the incenter, $QN$ is also the inradius. Therefore, $QN = QM$.
    * Using the Pythagorean Theorem in $\triangle QMN$:
        * $QM^2 + MN^2 = QN^2$
        * $QM^2 + 9^2 = QM^2$
        * $81 = 0$ (This is not possible, so we need to look at a different triangle)

* **Step 6: Find the Inradius (Again)**
    * Let's try $\triangle QKL$. We know that $QK$ is the inradius and $KL$ is unknown. We need to find $QL$.
    * Since $Q$ is the incenter, $QL$ is also the inradius. Therefore, $QL = QK$.
    * Using the Pythagorean Theorem in $\triangle QKL$:
        * $QK^2 + KL^2 = QL^2$
        * $QK^2 + KL^2 = QK^2$
        * $KL^2 = 0$ (This is not possible, so we need to look at a different triangle)

* **Step 7: Find the Inradius (One More Time)**
    * Let's try $\triangle JQP$. We know that $JQ$ is unknown and $JP$ is unknown. We need to find $QP$, which is the inradius.
    * Using the Pythagorean Theorem in $\triangle JQP$:
        * $JQ^2 + JP^2 = QP^2$
        * We don't know $JQ$ or $JP$, so we can't solve for $QP$ directly.

* **Step 8: Use the Perimeter of the Triangle**
    * The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
    * We know that $JL = 16.5$. We need to find $LN$ and $NJ$ to calculate the perimeter.
    * Since $Q$ is the incenter, $QL$ and $QN$ are both inradii. Therefore, $LN = KL + LN = KL + QK$ and $NJ = JP + JN = JP + QJ$.
    * We still don't know $KL$, $QK$, $JP$, or $QJ$, so we can't calculate the perimeter directly.

* **Step 9: Use the Area of the Triangle**
    * The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height.
    * We can use this formula to find the area of $\triangle JLN$ in two different ways:
        * **Method 1:** Using $JL$ as the base and $QP$ as the height.
        * **Method 2:** Using $LN$ as the base and $QK$ as the height.

* **Step 10: Set Up an Equation**

We are given a triangle ABC, where AB is 6 units long. A perpendicular bisector of AB intersects AB at point D and BC at point E. We are also given that the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13 units. Our goal is to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the properties of a perpendicular bisector.**
   * A perpendicular bisector is a line that cuts a line segment into two equal parts and is perpendicular to that line segment.
   * In our case, since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3 units.

* **Step 2: Use the given information about the perimeter of triangle ACE.**
   * The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides.
   * We know that the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13 units, so AC + CE + AE = 13.

* **Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the sides of triangles ABC and ACE.**
   * Notice that AC is a common side to both triangles ABC and ACE.
   * Also, AE is a side of triangle ACE and AB is a side of triangle ABC.
   * We can express AB as the sum of AD and DB: AB = AD + DB.

* **Step 4: Substitute the known values and solve for CE.**
   * We know that AD = DB = 3 units and AB = 6 units.
   * Substituting these values into the equation AB = AD + DB, we get 6 = 3 + 3.
   * Now, we can substitute the values of AC, AE, and AB into the equation for the perimeter of triangle ACE: AC + CE + AE = 13.
   * This becomes AC + CE + (AD + DB) = 13.
   * Simplifying, we get AC + CE + 3 + 3 = 13.
   * Combining like terms, we have AC + CE = 7.
   * Since we know that AC is a common side to both triangles, we can subtract AC from both sides of the equation to isolate CE: CE = 7 - AC.

* **Step 5: Calculate the perimeter of triangle ABC.**
   * The perimeter of triangle ABC is the sum of its sides: AB + BC + AC.
   * We know that AB = 6 units and BC = BE + CE.
   * We also know that CE = 7 - AC.
   * Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC is 6 + (BE + CE) + AC.
   * Substituting CE = 7 - AC, we get 6 + (BE + 7 - AC) + AC.
   * Simplifying, we get 13 + BE.

* **Step 6: Recognize that BE is equal to DE.**
   * Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, it divides BC into two equal parts: BE = EC.
   * We already found that CE = 7 - AC.
   * Therefore, BE = 7 - AC.

* **Step 7: Substitute BE into the perimeter equation and solve.**
   * The perimeter of triangle ABC is 13 + BE.
   * Substituting BE = 7 - AC, we get 13 + (7 - AC).
   * Simplifying, we get 20 - AC.

* **Step 8: We cannot determine the exact value of AC.**
   * We only know that AC + CE = 7.
   * Without more information about the lengths of AC and CE, we cannot determine the exact value of AC.

**3. Answer:**

The perimeter of triangle ABC is **20 - AC**, where AC is the length of side AC. We cannot determine the exact numerical value of the perimeter without more information.

We have a parallelogram ABCD with its angles bisected by lines that intersect at points E and F on side AD. We know the lengths of AB and AD, and we need to find the length of line segment EF.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Draw a diagram.**  It's always helpful to visualize the problem. We have a parallelogram with its angles bisected, creating two triangles inside.

* **Step 2: Identify key properties.**  We know that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. This means AB = CD and AD = BC. We also know that the angles bisected by BE and CF create equal angles within the triangles.

* **Step 3: Use angle properties.** Since BE bisects ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE. Similarly, CF bisects ∠BCD, so ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

* **Step 4: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem.** The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side proportionally to the other two sides.  

    * In triangle ABE, the angle bisector BE divides AD into segments AE and ED. Applying the theorem, we get: AE/ED = AB/BD.
    * In triangle DCF, the angle bisector CF divides AD into segments AF and FD. Applying the theorem, we get: AF/FD = CD/BD.

* **Step 5: Substitute known values.** We know AB = 3 and AD = 4. Since AB = CD, we also know CD = 3.  We can substitute these values into the equations from Step 4:

    * AE/ED = 3/BD
    * AF/FD = 3/BD

* **Step 6: Simplify the equations.** Since both equations have 3/BD, we can set them equal to each other:

    * AE/ED = AF/FD

* **Step 7: Use the fact that AE + ED = AD and AF + FD = AD.** We know AD = 4, so we can substitute:

    * AE/(4 - AE) = AF/(4 - AF)

* **Step 8: Solve for AE and AF.**  Cross-multiply and solve the equation. You'll find that AE = 2 and AF = 2.

* **Step 9: Calculate EF.** Since EF = AE + AF, we have EF = 2 + 2 = 4.

We are trying to find the measure of angle EOB.  In other words, we want to know how many degrees are in the angle formed by the lines OE and OB.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the given information.**
   * We know that ∠BOC = 50°. This means the angle formed by the lines OB and OC is 50 degrees.
   * We also know that OD bisects ∠AOE. This means that line OD cuts angle AOE into two equal angles.

* **Step 2: Understand the concept of bisecting an angle.**
   * When a line bisects an angle, it divides the angle into two equal parts. So, if OD bisects ∠AOE, then ∠AOD = ∠DOE.

* **Step 3: Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.**
   *  ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 180° (because these angles form a straight line)
   * Since ∠AOD = ∠DOE, we can rewrite this as: 2 * ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 180°

* **Step 4: Use the fact that angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.**
   * ∠AOE + ∠EOB + ∠BOC = 360° (because these angles are around point O)
   * We know ∠BOC = 50°, so we can rewrite this as: ∠AOE + ∠EOB + 50° = 360°
   * Simplifying, we get: ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 310°

* **Step 5: Combine the information from steps 3 and 4.**
   * We know 2 * ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 180°
   * We also know ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 310°
   * Since ∠AOE = 2 * ∠DOE, we can substitute to get: 2 * ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 310°

* **Step 6: Solve for ∠EOB.**
   * We have two equations:
      * 2 * ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 180°
      * 2 * ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 310°
   * Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get: 0 = 130°

We need to find the length of side CD in the trapezoid ABCD. We know the lengths of the other three sides: AB = 24, AD = 23, and BC = 16.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the right angles.** Notice that angles A and B are right angles. This means that AB and BC form the two shorter sides of a right triangle (triangle ABC).

* **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We can write this as:  a² + b² = c² where 'c' is the hypotenuse and 'a' and 'b' are the other two sides.

* **Step 3:  Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle ABC.** We know AB = 24 and BC = 16.  We want to find AC, which is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC.  So, we can plug these values into the Pythagorean Theorem: 
    * 24² + 16² = AC²

* **Step 4: Solve for AC.**
    * 576 + 256 = AC²
    * 832 = AC²
    * AC = √832

We are trying to find the measure of angle P (∠P) in the given diagram.  This means we need to figure out how many degrees are in that angle.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant angles.**
   * We know that ∠AOB = 90° (central angle of ⁀AB) and ∠COD = 50° (central angle of ⁀CD).
   * We also know that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

   * The Exterior Angle Theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

We have a circle with a square inside it. The circle's area is given as 18π square units. We need to figure out how long each side of the square is.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Find the circle's radius.**
   * We know the area of a circle is calculated using the formula: Area = π * radius² 
   * We're given the area (18π) and need to find the radius. Let's plug in the values and solve for the radius:
      * 18π = π * radius²
      * Divide both sides by π: 18 = radius²
      * Take the square root of both sides: √18 = radius
      * Simplify the square root: 3√2 = radius

* **Step 2: Relate the radius to the square's diagonal.**
   * Imagine drawing a diagonal line across the square. This diagonal line also goes through the center of the circle and is equal to the diameter of the circle.
   * The diameter is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is 2 * 3√2 = 6√2.

* **Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length.**
   * The diagonal of the square divides it into two right-angled triangles. 
   * The diagonal is the hypotenuse of these triangles, and the sides of the square are the legs.
   * The Pythagorean theorem states: a² + b² = c² (where a and b are the legs of a right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse).
   * In our case, a = b (since the sides of a square are equal), and c = 6√2.
   * Let's plug in the values: a² + a² = (6√2)²
   * Simplify: 2a² = 72

We have a circle with a diameter AB and a chord CD. We know that the angle ADC is 26 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle CAB.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles and arcs.**

   * In a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. This means that the angle formed by two chords that intersect on the circle's circumference is half the measure of the arc they cut off.

* **Step 2: Apply the relationship to angle ADC.**

   * Angle ADC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AC. Therefore, the measure of arc AC is twice the measure of angle ADC.
   * Arc AC = 2 * ∠ADC = 2 * 26° = 52°.

* **Step 3: Identify the relationship between the diameter and inscribed angles.**

   * An inscribed angle that intercepts a diameter is always a right angle (90 degrees).

* **Step 4: Apply the relationship to angle CAB.**

   * Angle CAB is an inscribed angle that intercepts diameter AB. Therefore, ∠CAB = 90°.

* **Step 5: Use the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.**

   * In triangle CAB, we know that ∠CAB = 90° and ∠ACB = 1/2 * arc AC = 1/2 * 52° = 26°.
   * Therefore, ∠CAB + ∠ACB + ∠CBA = 180°.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.**
   * A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle (like ∠O).
   * An inscribed angle is an angle whose vertex lies on the circle (like ∠C).
   * **Important Rule:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.

* **Step 2: Identify the corresponding central angle for ∠C.**
   * The central angle corresponding to ∠C is the angle formed by the same two points on the circle (A and B) but with its vertex at the center of the circle. This central angle is also ∠O.

* **Step 3: Apply the rule to find the measure of ∠C.**
   * Since ∠C is an inscribed angle and ∠O is its corresponding central angle, we know that the measure of ∠C is half the measure of ∠O.

* **Step 2: Understand parallel lines and angles.** When two lines are parallel, there are special relationships between the angles formed by a line that intersects them. One important relationship is that **alternate interior angles are equal**. Alternate interior angles are on opposite sides of the transversal (the line that intersects the parallel lines) and inside the parallel lines.

   *  Triangle ACD and triangle ABC share the same height (the perpendicular distance from point A to line BC). 
   *  The base of triangle ACD is DC, and the base of triangle ABC is BC.
   *  Since the height is the same, the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases.

   * We have a right triangle ABC and a smaller triangle ADE within it. 
   * Since D and E are midpoints, we know that line segment DE is parallel to line segment BC (a property of midpoints in triangles).

* **Step 2: Apply the Midsegment Theorem.**
   * The Midsegment Theorem states that the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
   * In our case, DE is the midsegment of triangle ABC, and BC is the third side.

* **Step 3: Calculate the length of BC.**

* **Step 3: Use the Pythagorean Theorem.**  Since we have a right triangle BMN, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BM. The Pythagorean Theorem states:  a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse. In our case, BM is one leg, MN is the other leg, and BN is the hypotenuse. 

    * We know MN = 2.
    * Since N is the midpoint of BC, and AB = 8, then BN = BC/2 = 8/2 = 4.

    * Taking the square root of both sides, we get BM = √12 = 2√3.

* **Step 4: Use the Angle Bisector Theorem.** The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides. In our case, AM bisects angle BAC, so we have: AB/AC = BM/MC.

    * We know AB = 8 and BM = 2√3.
    * We need to find MC.  Since BM is perpendicular to AM, and AM bisects angle BAC, then triangles BMA and CMA are congruent. Therefore, BM = MC = 2√3.

* **Step 5: Solve for AC.** Now we can plug the values we know into the equation from the Angle Bisector Theorem: 8/AC = 2√3/2√3.

    * Simplifying, we get 8/AC = 1.
    * Multiplying both sides by AC, we get 8 = AC.

We are given a right triangle with sides of length *a*, *b*, and *c*. We know the values of *a*, *b*, and *c*. We need to find the cosine of angle *A*.  

**2. Solution:**

   * The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse. 
   * In our triangle, angle *A* is the angle we are interested in. The adjacent side to angle *A* is side *b*, and the hypotenuse is side *c*.

We have a circle with a center point O and a radius of 5.0. Inside the circle, there's a chord AB with a length of 8.0. We need to find the distance between the center O and the chord AB.  Imagine drawing a line straight down from the center of the circle to the middle of the chord. That line is the distance we're looking for!

* **Step 1: Visualize the problem**
   * Draw a line segment from point O to the midpoint of chord AB. Let's call this midpoint M. This line segment OM is the distance we want to find.
   * Now, we have a right triangle OMA, where OA is the radius of the circle, AM is half the length of the chord AB, and OM is the distance we're looking for.

* **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
   * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In our triangle OMA, OA is the hypotenuse, AM is one leg, and OM is the other leg.
   * So, we can write the equation: OA² = AM² + OM²

* **Step 3: Substitute the known values**

We have a right triangle ABC, where angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees). Point D is the midpoint of the hypotenuse AB, which means it's exactly in the middle of line segment AB. We know that AB (the hypotenuse) is 10 units long.  The problem asks us to find the length of line segment CD.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**  This problem involves a right triangle and the midpoint of its hypotenuse. This suggests we should use the ""Midpoint Theorem"" which states: ""The midpoint of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equidistant from the three vertices.""  This means that the distance from point D to point A, point B, and point C are all equal.

* **Step 2: Apply the theorem.** Since D is the midpoint of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 10/2 = 5 units.

* **Step 3: Use the Pythagorean Theorem.**  We now have a right triangle,  △ACD, where we know the lengths of two sides: AC (one leg) and AD (the hypotenuse). We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the remaining side, CD. The Pythagorean Theorem states: a² + b² = c², where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.

* **Step 4: Substitute the known values.** In our triangle △ACD, we have:
    * a = AC (unknown)
    * b = CD (what we want to find)
    * c = AD = 5

* **Step 5: Solve for CD.**  Let's plug the values into the Pythagorean Theorem:
    * AC² + CD² = 5²
    * Since we don't know AC, we can't directly solve for CD. However, we can use the fact that △ABC is a right triangle and apply the Pythagorean Theorem again to find AC.

* **Step 6: Find AC.**  In △ABC, we have:
    * a = AC (what we want to find)
    * b = BC (unknown)
    * c = AB = 10

    * AC² + BC² = 10²
    * We still don't know BC, but we can use the fact that D is the midpoint of AB to find BC. Since AD = DB = 5, we know that BC = AB - AC = 10 - AC.

* **Step 7: Substitute BC in the equation.**
    * AC² + (10 - AC)² = 10²
    * Expand the equation: AC² + 100 - 20AC + AC² = 100
    * Simplify: 2AC² - 20AC = 0
    * Divide both sides by 2: AC² - 10AC = 0
    * Factor out AC: AC(AC - 10) = 0
    * This gives us two possible solutions: AC = 0 or AC = 10. Since AC is a side of a triangle, it cannot be 0. Therefore, AC = 10.

* **Step 8: Substitute AC back into the equation for CD.**
    * 10² + CD² = 5²
    * 100 + CD² = 25
    * CD² = 25 - 100 = -75
    * Since the square of a real number cannot be negative, there is no real solution for CD. This means there is an error in the problem statement or the diagram.

* **Step 1: Understand Tangent Properties**

   *  A tangent line to a circle is a line that touches the circle at exactly one point.  
   *  The tangent line is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  This means that angle OAB and angle OBA are both 90 degrees.

   *  Solving for the sum of angles PAB and PBA: ∠PAB + ∠PBA = 130°

   *  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle.  
   *  A central angle is an angle formed by two radii that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.
   *  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

* **Step 5: Apply the Relationship to Our Problem**

   *  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AB.
   *  Angle AOB is a central angle that intercepts the same arc AB.
   *  Therefore, ∠ACB = 1/2 * ∠AOB

* **Step 6: Find the Measure of Angle AOB**

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the formula for the area of a rhombus.**
   * The area of a rhombus is calculated by multiplying the lengths of its diagonals and dividing the result by 2.  
   * Formula: Area = (d1 * d2) / 2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.

* **Step 2: Define the variables.**
   * Let's call the shorter diagonal ""d"" and the longer diagonal ""2d"" (since it's twice as long).

* **Step 3: Substitute the known values into the formula.**
   * We know the area is 169 square millimeters. So, we have: 169 = (d * 2d) / 2

* **Step 4: Simplify the equation.**
   * 169 = (2d²) / 2
   * 169 = d²

* **Step 5: Solve for ""d"".**

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Pythagorean Theorem**

   The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We can write this as:

   *  a² + b² = c²

   where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the two shorter sides, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.

* **Step 2: Identify the sides in our triangle**

   * The side with length 14 is the hypotenuse because it's opposite the right angle.
   * The side with length 8 is one of the shorter sides.
   * The side with length 'A' is the other shorter side.

* **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

   We know the lengths of the hypotenuse (c = 14) and one shorter side (a = 8). We need to find the length of the other shorter side (b = A).  Let's plug these values into the Pythagorean Theorem:

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Draw a line segment from the center of the circle (point O) to point A.** This line segment is a radius of the circle, and we know its length is 2.

* **Step 2: Draw a line segment from the center of the circle (point O) to point B.** This line segment is also a radius of the circle, and its length is also 2.

* **Step 3: We now have an isosceles triangle OAB.** This is because two of its sides (OA and OB) are radii of the same circle and therefore have the same length.

* **Step 4: Since triangle OAB is isosceles, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.** This means that angle OAB is equal to angle OBA.

* **Step 5: The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees.** So, in triangle OAB, we have: angle OAB + angle OBA + angle AOB = 180 degrees.

* **Step 6: We know that angle C is 30 degrees.**  Since angle C and angle AOB are opposite angles, they are equal. Therefore, angle AOB = 30 degrees.

* **Step 7: Substitute the values we know into the equation from step 5:** angle OAB + angle OBA + 30 degrees = 180 degrees.

* **Step 8: Simplify the equation:** angle OAB + angle OBA = 150 degrees.

* **Step 9: Since angle OAB = angle OBA, we can rewrite the equation as:** 2 * angle OAB = 150 degrees.

* **Step 10: Solve for angle OAB:** angle OAB = 75 degrees.

* **Step 11: Now we have a triangle OAB where we know all three angles:** angle OAB = 75 degrees, angle OBA = 75 degrees, and angle AOB = 30 degrees.

* **Step 12: We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of side AB.** The Law of Cosines states: c² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C), where c is the side opposite angle C, and a and b are the other two sides.

* **Step 13: In our triangle, we want to find side AB, which is opposite angle AOB.** So, c = AB, a = OA = 2, b = OB = 2, and C = angle AOB = 30 degrees.

      * The measure of each angle in triangle ABC will be the same as the corresponding angle in triangle AB'C'.

We need to find the area of a parallelogram.  The area of a parallelogram is the space it takes up on a flat surface. To find the area, we need to know the length of its base and its height.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the base and height.**
   * We can choose any side of the parallelogram as the base. Let's choose BC as the base. 
   * The height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite side.  We need to draw a perpendicular line from A to BC. Let's call the point where this line intersects BC as E.

We need to find the length of side AC in the triangle.  We know that the triangle is isosceles, which means two sides are equal.  We are given expressions for the lengths of the sides, and we need to figure out which sides are equal and then solve for the length of AC.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the equal sides.**  Since the triangle is isosceles, we know that two of the sides must have the same length.  Looking at the diagram, we see that sides AB and BC have expressions with 'x' in them, while side AC has a different expression.  This means that AB and BC are the equal sides.

* **Step 2: Set the expressions for AB and BC equal to each other.**  We know that AB = BC, so we can write the equation: 
   9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5

* **Step 3: Solve for x.**  To solve for x, we need to get all the x terms on one side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other side.  We can do this by subtracting 5x from both sides and adding 1 to both sides:
   9x - 1 - 5x + 1 = 5x - 0.5 - 5x + 1
   4x = 0.5

* **Step 4: Isolate x.**  To get x by itself, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4:
   4x / 4 = 0.5 / 4
   x = 0.125

* **Step 5: Substitute the value of x into the expression for AC.**  Now that we know the value of x, we can substitute it into the expression for AC:

We have a right triangle ABC with a right angle at A. Three equilateral triangles are constructed outside the triangle, using the sides of triangle ABC as their sides. We know the areas of two of these equilateral triangles (△A'BC and △AB'C) and we need to find the area of the third equilateral triangle (△ABC').

**2. Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step:

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between the side length and area of an equilateral triangle.**

   * The area of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula: Area = (√3 / 4) * side² 
   * This formula tells us that the area of an equilateral triangle is directly proportional to the square of its side length.

* **Step 2: Find the side lengths of the equilateral triangles using their areas.**

   * We know the area of △A'BC is 10. Let's use the formula to find its side length:
      * 10 = (√3 / 4) * side²
      * Solving for side: side² = (10 * 4) / √3 = 40/√3
      * side = √(40/√3) = 2√(10/√3)

   * Similarly, we know the area of △AB'C is 4. Let's find its side length:
      * 4 = (√3 / 4) * side²
      * Solving for side: side² = (4 * 4) / √3 = 16/√3
      * side = √(16/√3) = 4√(1/√3)

* **Step 3: Recognize that the side lengths of the equilateral triangles correspond to the sides of the right triangle ABC.**

   * The side length of △A'BC is equal to the length of BC in triangle ABC.
   * The side length of △AB'C is equal to the length of AC in triangle ABC.

* **Step 4: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AB, which is the side length of △ABC'.**

   * The Pythagorean theorem states: a² + b² = c² where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
   * In our case, a = AC = 4√(1/√3) and b = BC = 2√(10/√3).
   * Applying the theorem: (4√(1/√3))² + (2√(10/√3))² = AB²
   * Simplifying: 16/√3 + 40/√3 = AB²
   * Combining terms: 56/√3 = AB²
   * Solving for AB: AB = √(56/√3) = 2√(14/√3)

* **Step 5: Calculate the area of △ABC' using the side length we just found.**

   * Area of △ABC' = (√3 / 4) * AB²
   * Substituting AB: Area = (√3 / 4) * (2√(14/√3))²
   * Simplifying: Area = (√3 / 4) * (56/√3) = 14

   * We know that angle AOF is 40 degrees.
   * Since angle AOF and angle AEF share the same arc AF, they are equal. Therefore, angle AEF is also 40 degrees.

* **Step 4: Find angle EAB**

   * We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships**

   * **Diameter and Chord:**  The diameter of a circle always bisects a chord if it passes through the midpoint of the chord. This means that line segment CG bisects chord EF.
   * **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle:**  An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. In our case, angle DCF is an inscribed angle, and angle DOC is the central angle subtending the same arc.

* **Step 2: Find the measure of angle DOC**

   * Since angle DCF is an inscribed angle and angle DOC is the central angle subtending the same arc, we can use the relationship mentioned above:

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between the square and the circle.**
   * Since the square is inscribed in the circle, all four vertices of the square lie on the circle's circumference. This means the diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square.

   * Notice that ∠AEC and ∠CED are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees) because they form a straight line.

* **Step 2: Calculate ∠CED.**
   * Since ∠AEC and ∠CED are supplementary, we can find ∠CED by subtracting ∠AEC from 180 degrees:
      * ∠CED = 180° - ∠AEC = 180° - 105° = 75°

We have a circle with center O and three points A, B, and C on the circle. We know that angle ACB is 25 degrees. Our goal is to find the measure of angle BAO.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles ACB and BAO.**

   *  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex is on the circle and its sides are chords of the circle.
   *  Angle BAO is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle and its sides are radii of the circle.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

   * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

We are given a circle with a diameter AB, a tangent line DC that intersects the circle at point C, and an angle ∠A = 25 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle ∠D.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant angles and lines.**

   * We are given ∠A = 25 degrees.
   * We need to find ∠D.
   * Line DC is a tangent to the circle, and line AB is a diameter.

* **Step 2: Apply the Tangent-Diameter Theorem.**

   * The Tangent-Diameter Theorem states that if a tangent line is drawn to a circle from a point outside the circle, then the angle formed by the tangent line and the diameter drawn to the point of tangency is a right angle (90 degrees).

   * In our problem, line DC is the tangent line, and line AB is the diameter. Therefore, ∠ACO = 90 degrees.

* **Step 3: Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.**

   * Since ∠ACO = 90 degrees, and ∠A = 25 degrees, we can find ∠BCO:
      * ∠BCO = 180 degrees - ∠ACO - ∠A = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 25 degrees = 65 degrees.

* **Step 4: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

   * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

   * In our problem, ∠BCO is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BC. Therefore, the measure of arc BC is twice the measure of ∠BCO:
      * Arc BC = 2 * ∠BCO = 2 * 65 degrees = 130 degrees.

* **Step 5: Use the fact that angles on a circle add up to 360 degrees.**

   * Since arc BC = 130 degrees, and arc BAC is a semicircle (180 degrees), we can find arc CD:
      * Arc CD = 360 degrees - arc BC - arc BAC = 360 degrees - 130 degrees - 180 degrees = 50 degrees.

   * The Tangent-Chord Theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent line and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

   * In our problem, ∠D is the angle formed by the tangent line DC and the chord CD. Therefore, ∠D is half the measure of arc CD:

We have a circle with a diameter of 8. A chord, CE, is drawn inside the circle, and we know its length is 13.5. We need to find the length of the segment BD, which is a perpendicular line drawn from the center of the circle to the chord.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**  We can use the **Perpendicular Chord Bisector Theorem** which states that a perpendicular drawn from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord. This means that BD bisects CE, so CD = DE = CE/2.

* **Step 2: Calculate CD and DE.**  Since CE = 13.5, then CD = DE = 13.5 / 2 = 6.75.

* **Step 3: Visualize the right triangle.**  We now have a right triangle, BDC, where BD is one leg, CD is the other leg, and BC is the hypotenuse. We know BC is the radius of the circle, which is half the diameter, so BC = 8/2 = 4.

* **Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.**  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (BC) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (BD and CD).  We can write this as: BC² = BD² + CD²

* **Step 5: Substitute the known values.**  We know BC = 4 and CD = 6.75.  Substituting these values into the equation, we get: 4² = BD² + 6.75²

* **Step 6: Solve for BD.**  Simplifying the equation, we get: 16 = BD² + 45.5625.  Subtracting 45.5625 from both sides, we get: -29.5625 = BD².  Since we are dealing with lengths, we take the square root of both sides, remembering to consider both positive and negative solutions.  Therefore, BD = √(-29.5625) ≈ 5.44.

We are trying to find the measure of angle OAC, which is the angle formed by lines OA and AC inside the circle. We know that line OA is parallel to line BC, and we know the measure of angle AOB, which is the angle formed by lines OA and OB inside the circle. 

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles AOB and BOC.**

   * Since line OA is parallel to line BC, we know that angle AOB and angle BOC are alternate interior angles. 
   * Alternate interior angles are equal in measure. 
   * Therefore, angle BOC also measures 40 degrees.

* **Step 2: Identify the relationship between angles BOC and AOC.**

   * Angle BOC and angle AOC are adjacent angles, meaning they share a common side (OC) and a common vertex (O).
   * The sum of adjacent angles is equal to the measure of the straight angle, which is 180 degrees.
   * Therefore, angle AOC = 180 degrees - angle BOC = 180 degrees - 40 degrees = 140 degrees.

* **Step 3: Identify the relationship between angles AOC and OAC.**

   * Angle AOC and angle OAC are angles in a triangle (triangle AOC).
   * The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
   * Therefore, angle OAC = 180 degrees - angle AOC - angle ACO.

* **Step 4: Determine the measure of angle ACO.**

   * Angle ACO is an inscribed angle in the circle, meaning its vertex is on the circle and its sides are chords of the circle.
   * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * The intercepted arc of angle ACO is arc AC.
   * Since angle AOB is 40 degrees, arc AB is also 40 degrees (the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc).
   * Since arc AB is 40 degrees, arc AC is 360 degrees - 40 degrees = 320 degrees.
   * Therefore, angle ACO = 320 degrees / 2 = 160 degrees.

* **Step 5: Calculate the measure of angle OAC.**

   * Angle OAC = 180 degrees - angle AOC - angle ACO = 180 degrees - 140 degrees - 160 degrees = -120 degrees.

**3. Answer:**

The degree of angle OAC is -120 degrees. However, angles are typically measured between 0 and 360 degrees.  Since the angle is negative, we can add 360 degrees to find the equivalent positive angle: -120 degrees + 360 degrees = 240 degrees. 

Therefore, the degree of angle OAC is **240 degrees**.

We have a rhombus (a special type of parallelogram where all sides are equal) called ABCD.  E and F are the midpoints of sides AB and AD, respectively. We know that AB (one side of the rhombus) is 5 units long and AC (one of the diagonals of the rhombus) is 6 units long.  We need to find the length of line segment EF.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1:  Recognize the key property of a rhombus.**  The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. This means that line segment AC is cut in half by line segment BD, and they intersect at a 90-degree angle.

* **Step 2:  Identify the relevant triangles.**  Focus on triangle AEF.  We know that AE is half of AB (since E is the midpoint of AB), so AE = 2.5 units.  Similarly, AF is half of AD, so AF = 2.5 units.  We also know that angle EAF is a right angle because the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.

* **Step 3:  Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.**  Triangle AEF is a right triangle, so we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of EF. The Pythagorean Theorem states:  a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.

* **Step 4:  Substitute the known values.**  In triangle AEF, AE = 2.5 and AF = 2.5.  We want to find EF, which is the hypotenuse.  So, we have:  2.5² + 2.5² = EF²

* **Step 5:  Solve for EF.**  2.5² = 6.25, so 6.25 + 6.25 = EF².  This simplifies to 12.5 = EF².  To find EF, we take the square root of both sides: √12.5 = EF.

* We are given a triangle with two sides measuring 7 and 12. We need to figure out which of the given options cannot be the perimeter of this triangle. The perimeter is the total length of all the sides added together.

**2. Solution:**

* **Understanding the Triangle Inequality Theorem:** This theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. This is a fundamental rule for triangles.

* **Applying the Theorem:** Let's test each of the given options to see if they satisfy the Triangle Inequality Theorem:

    * **Option 1:** If the perimeter is 18, the third side would be 18 - 7 - 12 = -1. This is impossible because a side length cannot be negative.

    * **Option 2:** If the perimeter is 19, the third side would be 19 - 7 - 12 = 0. This is also impossible because a side length cannot be zero.

    * **Option 3:** If the perimeter is 20, the third side would be 20 - 7 - 12 = 1. This satisfies the Triangle Inequality Theorem because 1 + 7 > 12, 1 + 12 > 7, and 7 + 12 > 1.

    * **Option 4:** If the perimeter is 21, the third side would be 21 - 7 - 12 = 2. This satisfies the Triangle Inequality Theorem because 2 + 7 > 12, 2 + 12 > 7, and 7 + 12 > 2.

We need to find the total length of all the sides of the shape ABCDE.  This shape is made up of a square and a triangle. 

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Find the side length of the square.**
   * We know the area of the square is 1. 
   * The area of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself (side * side). 
   * So, to find the side length, we need to find the square root of the area.

* **Step 2: Find the side length of the equilateral triangle.**
   * An equilateral triangle has all sides equal in length.
   * Since side CE of the triangle is also a side of the square, it is 1 unit long.
   * Therefore, all sides of the triangle (CD and DE) are also 1 unit long.

We know that angle A is 110 degrees.  Our goal is to find the measure of angle BOC, which is the angle formed by the intersection of the angle bisectors.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand Angle Bisectors**
   * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. So, if OB bisects angle B, then angle ABO is equal to angle CBO. Similarly, angle ACO is equal to angle BCO.

* **Step 2: Use the Angle Sum Property of Triangles**
   * The sum of all angles inside a triangle is always 180 degrees.  Let's apply this to triangle ABC:
      * ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
      * 110° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
      * ∠B + ∠C = 70°

* **Step 3: Focus on Triangle BOC**
   * Now, let's look at triangle BOC. We know that:
      * ∠BOC + ∠OBC + ∠OCB = 180° (Angle Sum Property)
      * ∠OBC = 1/2 ∠B (OB is the angle bisector of ∠B)
      * ∠OCB = 1/2 ∠C (OC is the angle bisector of ∠C)

* **Step 4: Substitute and Solve**
   * Substitute the values we know into the equation for triangle BOC:
      * ∠BOC + (1/2 ∠B) + (1/2 ∠C) = 180°
      * ∠BOC + 1/2 (∠B + ∠C) = 180°
      * ∠BOC + 1/2 (70°) = 180° (We know ∠B + ∠C = 70°)

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify corresponding angles.**
   *  Angle 1 and angle 2 are corresponding angles because they are in the same relative position at the intersection of a transversal line with two parallel lines. 
   *  The rule for corresponding angles is that they are equal. So, angle 1 = angle 2.

* **Step 2: Find the measure of angle 1.**
   * We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. 
   *  We are given that angle C is 90 degrees and angle B is 58 degrees.

* **Step 1: Reflect point A across BC and CD.**
   * We reflect point A across BC to get point A' and reflect point A across CD to get point A''.
   * This is done because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. By reflecting point A, we are essentially finding the shortest possible paths from A to M and A to N.

* **Step 2: Connect A' and A'' to M and N respectively.**
   * We draw lines A'M and A''N.
   * This is done because we want to find the perimeter of triangle AMN, and these lines represent the shortest possible paths from A' to M and A'' to N.

* **Step 3: Analyze the angles.**
   * Since A' is the reflection of A across BC, ∠A'MB = ∠AMB.
   * Similarly, since A'' is the reflection of A across CD, ∠A''ND = ∠AND.
   * We know that ∠BAD = 120 degrees, and since ∠B = ∠D = 90 degrees, we can deduce that ∠ABC = ∠ADC = 60 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠A'BM = ∠ABM = 60 degrees and ∠A''DN = ∠ADN = 60 degrees.

* **Step 4: Apply the Angle Sum Property of Triangles.**
   * In triangle A'BM, ∠A'BM + ∠A'MB + ∠BMA' = 180 degrees.
   * Substituting the known angles, we get 60 degrees + ∠AMB + ∠BMA' = 180 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠AMB + ∠BMA' = 120 degrees.

* **Step 3: Find angle B**
   * We know that CD bisects angle BCA. This means that angle BCD is equal to angle ACD. Since angle CGF is 88 degrees, and angle CGF is the sum of angle BCG and angle GCF, we can find angle BCG by subtracting angle GCF from angle CGF. 
   * Angle BCG = angle CGF - angle GCF = 88 degrees - angle GCF.

   * We know that AB is a diameter, which means angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle.
   * We are given that angle BCD is 25 degrees.
   * We need to find angle AOD.

* **Step 2: Use the angle sum property of triangles.**

   * The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees.
   * In triangle BCD, we have: ∠BCD + ∠CBD + ∠CDB = 180°
   * We know ∠BCD = 25°, and since BC and CD are chords of the circle, ∠CBD = ∠CDB (angles subtended by the same chord are equal).
   * Therefore, 25° + ∠CBD + ∠CBD = 180°
   * Simplifying, we get 2∠CBD = 155°
   * So, ∠CBD = ∠CDB = 77.5°

* **Step 3: Use the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.**

   * A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle, with its vertex at the center of the circle.
   * An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle, with its vertex on the circle.
   * The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
   * In our case, angle AOD is a central angle, and angle ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc (arc AD).
   * Therefore, ∠AOD = 2 * ∠ACB = 2 * 90° = 180°

We need to find the measure of angle PAQ, which is the angle formed by the lines AP and AQ.  

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand Symmetry**
   *  Symmetry means that if we fold the figure along the line of symmetry, the two halves will perfectly overlap. 
   *  Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, this means that line MP is the perpendicular bisector of line AB.  
   *  Similarly, line NQ is the perpendicular bisector of line AC.

* **Step 2: Identify Key Angles**
   *  Because MP is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP = 90 degrees.
   *  Similarly, ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ = 90 degrees.

* **Step 3: Use Angle Properties**
   *  The angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.  
   *  Therefore, ∠MAP + ∠BAP = 180 degrees.
   *  Since ∠BAC = 110 degrees, we can find ∠BAP: ∠BAP = 180 degrees - ∠BAC = 180 degrees - 110 degrees = 70 degrees.

* **Step 4: Apply Symmetry**
   *  Because of symmetry, ∠MAP = ∠BAP = 70 degrees.

* **Step 5: Find ∠PAQ**
   *  We know that ∠PAQ = ∠MAP + ∠NAQ.
   *  We already found ∠MAP = 70 degrees.
   *  Since ∠ANQ = 90 degrees, ∠NAQ = 90 degrees - ∠BAN = 90 degrees - 70 degrees = 20 degrees.
   *  Therefore, ∠PAQ = 70 degrees + 20 degrees = 90 degrees.

We need to find the value of 'x' in the given circle. We know that the chords CH and KJ are congruent, and we have an angle measure of 83 degrees and another angle measure of (2x - 27) degrees. We need to use this information to solve for 'x'.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1:** Identify the relevant theorem.  We know that congruent chords in a circle subtend equal angles at the center. This means that the angle formed by chord CH at the center of the circle is equal to the angle formed by chord KJ at the center of the circle.

* **Step 2:**  Apply the theorem. We are given that chord CH is congruent to chord KJ. Therefore, the angle formed by chord CH at the center (which is 83 degrees) is equal to the angle formed by chord KJ at the center (which is (2x - 27) degrees).

* **Step 3:** Set up an equation. We can write this relationship as an equation: 83 degrees = (2x - 27) degrees.

* **Step 4:** Solve for 'x'. To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 
    * First, add 27 degrees to both sides of the equation: 83 degrees + 27 degrees = (2x - 27) degrees + 27 degrees.
    * This simplifies to 110 degrees = 2x.
    * Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2: 110 degrees / 2 = 2x / 2.

We have a triangle called QRS. We know that all the sides of this triangle are equal in length because it's an equilateral triangle. We are given expressions for the lengths of two sides, and we need to find the length of the side RS.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Set up an equation.** Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, we can set the expressions for the lengths of sides QR and QS equal to each other. This gives us the equation: 
   * 4x = 6x - 1

* **Step 2: Solve for x.** To solve for x, we need to get all the x terms on one side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other side. 
   * Subtract 6x from both sides: 4x - 6x = 6x - 1 - 6x
   * This simplifies to: -2x = -1

* **Step 3: Isolate x.** To get x by itself, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -2: -2x / -2 = -1 / -2
   * This gives us: x = 1/2

* **Step 4: Substitute the value of x into the expression for RS.** We know that RS is represented by the expression 2x + 1. Now that we know x = 1/2, we can substitute it into the expression: 2 * (1/2) + 1

* **Step 5: Simplify the expression.** Multiply 2 by 1/2, which equals 1. Then add 1 to get the final answer: 1 + 1 = 2

We are given a diagram with two parallel lines, l1 and l2, and a triangle placed between them. The triangle has a 30-degree angle and a right angle. We know that angle 1 is 76 degrees. Our goal is to find the measure of angle 2.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles 1 and 2.**

   *  Angles 1 and 2 are **alternate interior angles**. This means they are on opposite sides of the transversal (the line that intersects the parallel lines) and inside the parallel lines.

* **Step 2: Apply the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem.**

   * The Alternate Interior Angles Theorem states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the alternate interior angles are congruent (equal in measure).

* **Step 3: Use the theorem to find the measure of angle 2.**

We need to find the value of 'x' in this diagram. To do that, we need to use the rules of geometry to figure out the relationship between the angles shown. 

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant angles and their relationship.**
    * We see that the angle marked (4x + 50)° is an inscribed angle of the circle. 
    * The angle marked 3x° is an angle formed by a tangent and a chord.
    * The angle marked 30° is an angle formed by a tangent and a chord.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
    * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. 
    * In our diagram, the inscribed angle (4x + 50)° intercepts the same arc as the angle formed by the tangent and chord (3x° + 30°). 
    * Therefore, we can write the equation: (4x + 50)° = 1/2 (3x° + 30°)

* **Step 3: Solve for x.**
    * Now we have an equation with one unknown, 'x'. Let's solve it:
        * Multiply both sides of the equation by 2: 2(4x + 50)° = 3x° + 30°
        * Distribute the 2 on the left side: 8x° + 100° = 3x° + 30°
        * Subtract 3x° from both sides: 5x° + 100° = 30°
        * Subtract 100° from both sides: 5x° = -70°

512,What is the y coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle of uniform areal density shown in Figure 9-C?,0.24,"**1. Problem:**

We need to find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of the triangle. This means we need to figure out where the triangle would balance perfectly if it were placed on a horizontal line.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Divide the triangle into smaller parts.** Imagine dividing the triangle into many thin horizontal strips, each with a tiny width.  

* **Step 2: Find the center of mass of each strip.**  The center of mass of each strip is located at its midpoint. Since each strip is horizontal, its midpoint will be at a distance of y/2 from the base of the triangle, where y is the height of the strip.

* **Step 3:  Consider the mass of each strip.** The mass of each strip is proportional to its area. Since the triangle has uniform areal density, the mass of each strip is directly proportional to its width (which is very small) and its length (which is the length of the base of the triangle at that height).

* **Step 4:  Sum up the contributions of all the strips.** To find the overall center of mass, we need to average the y-coordinates of all the strips, weighted by their masses. This means we need to sum up the product of the y-coordinate of each strip and its mass, and then divide by the total mass of the triangle.

* **Step 5:  Use calculus to make the sum continuous.** Since we have infinitely many strips, we need to use calculus to make the sum continuous. We can do this by integrating the product of the y-coordinate and the mass of each strip over the entire height of the triangle.

* **Step 6:  Set up the integral.** Let's say the height of the triangle is 'h'. The y-coordinate of each strip is 'y', and its mass is proportional to its length (which is 2x) and its width (which is 'dy').  We can express the length of the base of the triangle at height 'y' as 2x using similar triangles: x/y = a/h, so x = (a/h)y.  Therefore, the mass of each strip is proportional to 2(a/h)y * dy.

* **Step 7:  Integrate and solve.** The integral for the y-coordinate of the center of mass is:

   (∫(y * 2(a/h)y * dy) from 0 to h) / (∫(2(a/h)y * dy) from 0 to h)

   Simplifying the integral:

   (2a/h) * (∫(y^2 * dy) from 0 to h) / (2a/h) * (∫(y * dy) from 0 to h)

   Evaluating the integrals:

   (2a/h) * (h^3/3) / (2a/h) * (h^2/2)

   Simplifying:

   (2h/3) / h

   **Therefore, the y-coordinate of the center of mass is h/3.**

**3. Answer:**

The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle is **h/3**, where 'h' is the height of the triangle.

We need to find the total resistance between points 'a' and 'b' in this infinite chain of resistors. Imagine you're trying to send electricity from point 'a' to point 'b'. How much resistance would it encounter along the way?

**2. Solution:**

Let's break this down step by step:

* **Step 1:  Identify the repeating pattern.** Notice that the circuit has a repeating pattern of three resistors.  One resistor is connected directly between points 'a' and 'b', and two other resistors are connected in parallel to it.

* **Step 2:  Simplify the parallel resistors.**  The two resistors in parallel have the same resistance (R).  To find the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel, we use the formula:

   1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R

   Simplifying this, we get:

   R_parallel = R/2

* **Step 3:  Represent the circuit with a simplified equivalent.** Now, we can replace the two parallel resistors with a single resistor of resistance R/2.  Our circuit now looks like this:

   * A resistor of resistance R connected directly between 'a' and 'b'.
   * A resistor of resistance R/2 connected to the right of the first resistor.
   * The rest of the infinite chain continues to the right.

* **Step 4:  Recognize the self-similarity.**  The simplified circuit still has the same repeating pattern as the original circuit.  We have a resistor connected directly between 'a' and 'b', and another resistor connected in series with the rest of the infinite chain.

* **Step 5:  Set up an equation.** Let 'x' be the total resistance of the infinite chain.  We can write an equation based on the simplified circuit:

   x = R + R/2 + x/2

   This equation says that the total resistance 'x' is equal to the resistance of the first resistor (R) plus the resistance of the parallel combination (R/2) plus half the resistance of the remaining infinite chain (x/2).

* **Step 6:  Solve for x.**  Let's solve this equation for 'x':

   x - x/2 = R + R/2
   x/2 = 3R/2
   x = 3R

**3. Answer:**

The total resistance between points 'a' and 'b' is 3R. Since R = 1, the final answer is 3.

We need to find the perimeter of rectangle ABCD, which is made up of two identical squares. We know that the area of each square is 9.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Find the side length of each square.**
   * We know that the area of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself: Area = side * side.
   * Since the area of each square is 9, we can set up the equation: 9 = side * side.
   * To find the side length, we need to find the square root of 9: √9 = 3.
   * Therefore, the side length of each square is 3.

* **Step 2: Determine the dimensions of the rectangle.**
   * The rectangle is made up of two squares side by side.
   * The width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square, which is 3.
   * The length of the rectangle is equal to the side lengths of two squares combined, which is 3 + 3 = 6.

* **Step 3: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.**
   * The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).
   * We know the length is 6 and the width is 3, so we can plug those values into the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 3).
   * Simplifying the equation: Perimeter = 2 * 9.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles B and DEF.**

   *  Since AB and CD are parallel lines, and AF is a transversal, we know that angle B and angle DEF are corresponding angles. 
   *  Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection of the transversal with the parallel lines. 
   *  The rule for corresponding angles is that they are always equal.

* **Step 2: Apply the rule of corresponding angles.**

   *  We know that angle B is 65 degrees.
   *  Since angle B and angle DEF are corresponding angles, they are equal.
   *  Therefore, angle DEF is also 65 degrees.

* **Step 3: Consider the right angle at E.**

   *  We are given that BE is perpendicular to AF, which means that angle BEF is a right angle.
   *  A right angle measures 90 degrees.

* **Step 4: Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.**

* **Step 2: Set up an equation.** We know that angle MCN is 60 degrees, angle RCM is (x-1) degrees, and angle LCN is (3x+5) degrees.  We can write an equation to represent the sum of all these angles: 
   * 60° + (x - 1)° + (3x + 5)° = 360°

* **Step 3: Simplify the equation.** Combine the like terms on the left side of the equation:
   * 60° + x° - 1° + 3x° + 5° = 360°

   * This means that the sum of the measures of all the arcs in a circle must equal 360 degrees.

* **Step 5: Apply the relationship to our problem.**
   * We know that arc ADC is 140 degrees.
   * We also know that arc AC is represented by 'x'.
   * Therefore, we can write the equation: arc ADC + arc AC = 360°  or  140° + x = 360°

* **Step 6: Solve for 'x'.**
   * Subtract 140° from both sides of the equation: 140° + x - 140° = 360° - 140°
   * This gives us: x = 220°

228,"As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of circle O, DB and DC are respectively tangent to circle O at points B and C. If ∠ACE = 25.0, then the degree of ∠D is ()",50°,"**1. Problem:**

We are trying to find the measure of angle D (∠D) in the diagram.  We know that AB is the diameter of the circle, and DB and DC are tangent lines to the circle. We also know that angle ACE (∠ACE) is 25 degrees.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships**

   * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:**  A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means that ∠OBC = 90° and ∠OCD = 90°.

* **Step 2:  Find ∠ABO**

   * Since AB is the diameter, ∠AOB = 180° (a straight angle).
   * We know ∠OBC = 90°.
   * Therefore, ∠ABO = 180° - 90° = 90°.

* **Step 3: Find ∠BAE**

   * ∠BAE and ∠ACE are alternate interior angles formed by the transversal AE cutting parallel lines AB and CD.
   * Alternate interior angles are equal, so ∠BAE = ∠ACE = 25°.

* **Step 4: Find ∠BAD**

   * ∠BAD is an exterior angle of triangle ABO.
   * The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
   * Therefore, ∠BAD = ∠ABO + ∠BAE = 90° + 25° = 115°.

* **Step 5: Find ∠D**

   * ∠D and ∠BAD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°).
   * Therefore, ∠D = 180° - ∠BAD = 180° - 115° = 65°.

We need to find the measure of the angle ∠CTD, which is the angle formed by the line segment CT and the line segment TD.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the key shapes.** We have a square ABCD and a semicircle with center T and diameter AD.

* **Step 2: Understand the relationship between tangents and radii.**  A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. In our case, CT is tangent to the semicircle at point C, and TC is a radius of the semicircle. Therefore, ∠TCD is a right angle (90 degrees).

* **Step 3: Recognize the properties of a square.**  All angles in a square are right angles (90 degrees). Therefore, ∠CDT is also a right angle (90 degrees).

* **Step 4: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.** The sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. In triangle CDT, we know ∠TCD = 90 degrees and ∠CDT = 90 degrees. Therefore, ∠CTD = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees = 0 degrees.

364,"As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of ⊙O, and points C and D are on ⊙O. If ∠ABD = 50.0, then the degree of ∠BCD is ()",40°,"**1. Problem:**

We are given a circle with diameter AB and points C and D on the circle. We know that angle ABD is 50 degrees. Our goal is to find the measure of angle BCD.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships**

   *  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, we know that angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

* **Step 2: Apply the Angle Addition Postulate**

   *  Angle ABD is made up of two smaller angles: angle ABC and angle CBD.  The Angle Addition Postulate states that the measure of a larger angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its smaller angles. So, we can write: ∠ABD = ∠ABC + ∠CBD.

* **Step 3: Substitute known values**

   * We know that ∠ABD = 50 degrees.  Let's call ∠ABC = x.  We don't know the measure of ∠CBD yet.  Substituting these values into the equation from Step 2, we get: 50° = x + ∠CBD.

* **Step 4: Find the measure of angle ABC**

   *  We know that ∠ACB = 90° and ∠ABC + ∠CAB = 90° (because the angles in a triangle add up to 180°).  Since ∠ABC = x, we can write: x + ∠CAB = 90°.  We also know that ∠CAB = ∠CBD (because they are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc, CD).  Therefore, we can substitute ∠CBD for ∠CAB in the equation: x + ∠CBD = 90°.

* **Step 5: Solve for x**

   *  We now have two equations:
      * 50° = x + ∠CBD
      * x + ∠CBD = 90°
   *  Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get: 50° - 90° = 0, which simplifies to -40° = 0.  This is not possible, so we must have made an error somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.

* **Step 6: Correct the error**

   *  We made a mistake in Step 4.  We said that ∠CAB = ∠CBD because they are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc.  However, this is only true if the arc is a minor arc.  In this case, arc CD is a major arc, so ∠CAB and ∠CBD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°).

* **Step 7:  Apply the supplementary angle relationship**

   *  Since ∠CAB and ∠CBD are supplementary, we can write: ∠CAB + ∠CBD = 180°.  We also know that ∠ABC + ∠CAB = 90°.  Substituting ∠CBD for ∠CAB in the second equation, we get: ∠ABC + ∠CBD = 90°.

* **Step 8: Solve for ∠CBD**

   *  We now have two equations:
      * ∠ABC + ∠CBD = 90°
      * ∠ABC + ∠CBD = 180°
   *  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get: 0 = 90°.  This is not possible, so we must have made another error.  Let's go back and check our work.

* **Step 9:  Correct the error**

   *  We made a mistake in Step 7.  We said that ∠ABC + ∠CBD = 90°.  However, this is not true.  We know that ∠ABC + ∠CBD = 50° (from Step 3).

* **Step 10:  Solve for ∠CBD**

   *  We now have the equation: ∠ABC + ∠CBD = 50°.  We also know that ∠ABC + ∠CAB = 90°.  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get: ∠CAB - ∠CBD = 40°.  Since ∠CAB = ∠CBD (because they are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc, CD), we can substitute ∠CBD for ∠CAB in the equation: ∠CBD - ∠CBD = 40",False,0,8.275966882705688,1522.0
990,"In $\odot S$, $m \widehat {PQR}=98$, Find $m \widehat {PQ}$.",49,"**1. Problem:**

We have a circle with a central angle,  ∠PSQ, that intercepts an arc,  PQ. We know the measure of the entire arc, PQR, is 98 degrees. We need to find the measure of the smaller arc, PQ.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between central angles and intercepted arcs.**
   * A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle.
   * The intercepted arc is the part of the circle that lies between the two rays of the central angle.
   * **Important Rule:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Step 2: Identify the central angle and its intercepted arc.**
   * In this problem, ∠PSQ is the central angle.
   * The intercepted arc for ∠PSQ is arc PQ.

* **Step 3: Apply the rule to find the measure of arc PQ.**
   * Since ∠PSQ intercepts arc PQ, we know that  m∠PSQ = m arc PQ.
   * We are given that m arc PQR = 98 degrees.
   * Since arc PQ is a part of arc PQR, we can find the measure of arc PQ by subtracting the measure of arc QR from the measure of arc PQR.
   * m arc PQ = m arc PQR - m arc QR
   * m arc PQ = 98 degrees - m arc QR

* **Step 4: Find the measure of arc QR.**
   * We know that the measure of a straight angle is 180 degrees.
   * ∠PSR is a straight angle, and it intercepts arc PQR.
   * Therefore, m arc PQR + m arc QR = 180 degrees.
   * We know m arc PQR = 98 degrees.
   * So, 98 degrees + m arc QR = 180 degrees.
   * Subtracting 98 degrees from both sides, we get m arc QR = 82 degrees.

* **Step 5: Calculate the measure of arc PQ.**
   * We know m arc PQ = m arc PQR - m arc QR.
   * m arc PQ = 98 degrees - 82 degrees.
   * m arc PQ = 16 degrees.

We have a triangle ABC with a point F inside.  We know that CF is an angle bisector of angle ACB, and BF is an angle bisector of angle ABC. We also know that CG is perpendicular to AB and angle ACG is 32 degrees.  Our goal is to find the measure of angle BFC.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Find angle BCG.**

   * Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know that angle CGB is a right angle (90 degrees).
   * We also know that angle ACG is 32 degrees.
   * The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So, angle BCG = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 32 degrees = 58 degrees.

* **Step 2: Find angle FCB.**

   * CF is the angle bisector of angle ACB, meaning it divides angle ACB into two equal angles.
   * Since angle BCG is 58 degrees, angle FCB is half of that, which is 58 degrees / 2 = 29 degrees.

* **Step 3: Find angle FBC.**

   * BF is the angle bisector of angle ABC, meaning it divides angle ABC into two equal angles.
   * Since angle FCB is 29 degrees, angle FBC is also 29 degrees.

* **Step 4: Find angle BFC.**

   * The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
   * So, angle BFC = 180 degrees - 29 degrees - 29 degrees = 122 degrees.

The measure of angle BFC is 122 degrees.

* We have a regular pentagon (a five-sided shape with all sides equal and all angles equal) inscribed in a circle.  The center of the circle is also the center of the pentagon. We need to find the measure of angle ADE.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Find the measure of each interior angle of the pentagon.**
    * The formula for the measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon is: (n-2) * 180 / n, where n is the number of sides.
    * In this case, n = 5 (pentagon), so each interior angle measures: (5-2) * 180 / 5 = 108 degrees.

* **Step 2: Understand the relationship between the pentagon's angles and the central angle.**
    * Since the pentagon is regular, each side of the pentagon is a chord of the circle.
    * Each chord creates a central angle at the center of the circle (point O).
    * The central angle is twice the measure of the inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.

* **Step 3: Find the measure of the central angle corresponding to side AD.**
    * The central angle corresponding to side AD is angle AOD.
    * Since the pentagon is regular, angle AOD is 1/5 of the total central angle of 360 degrees.
    * Therefore, angle AOD measures 360 / 5 = 72 degrees.

* **Step 4: Find the measure of angle ADE.**
    * Angle ADE is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as central angle AOD.
    * We know that the central angle is twice the measure of the inscribed angle.
    * Therefore, angle ADE measures 72 / 2 = 36 degrees.

* The measure of angle ADE is 36 degrees.

* **Step 1: Understand Straight Angles**
   * A straight angle is formed when two rays share the same endpoint and form a straight line. 
   * The measure of a straight angle is always 180 degrees.

* **Step 2: Find the value of 'x'**
   * We know that 'x' and 70 degrees form a straight angle.
