You are a Math Explorer AI on a mission to discover the solution to a challenging problem hidden within an ancient artifact (see image). Your onboard AI assistant needs your guidance to decipher the problem and navigate the solution.  

Mission Log:

1. Artifact Analysis:
   * Describe the artifact: What mathematical symbols and concepts are visible in the image?
   * State the Mission Objective: What is the specific mathematical problem we need to solve?

2. Solution Navigation:
   * Guide your AI assistant through each step of the solution, as if charting a course through uncharted territory. 
   * For each step: 
      * What is the purpose of this step?  (e.g., "Simplify the expression," "Solve for the unknown variable.")
      * Provide a clear explanation of the mathematical operation being performed, as if you were logging your actions for others to follow.
      * If a formula is required, write it down like a newly discovered equation. Explain its relevance to the current step and what each part represents.
      * Show all calculations and the result for each step.

3. Mission Debrief:
   * Clearly state the final, simplified answer to the problem.
   * Verify the Solution:  Explain one method we can use to be absolutely sure our answer is correct.
