634,如图，直线AB，CD交于点O．射线OE平分∠BOC，若∠AOD＝70°，则∠AOE等于（）,145°,"1. **Problem:**  Find the measure of angle AOE, given that line AB and CD intersect at point O, ray OE bisects angle BOC, and angle AOD is 70 degrees.

2. **Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles AOD and BOC.**
    * Angles AOD and BOC are vertical angles, meaning they are opposite angles formed by the intersection of two lines. 
    * Vertical angles are always congruent (equal in measure).
    * Therefore, angle BOC = angle AOD = 70 degrees.

* **Step 2: Understand the concept of angle bisector.**
    * A bisector divides an angle into two equal parts.
    * Since ray OE bisects angle BOC, angle BOE = angle COE = (1/2) * angle BOC.

* **Step 3: Calculate the measure of angle BOE.**
    * Angle BOE = (1/2) * angle BOC = (1/2) * 70 degrees = 35 degrees.

* **Step 4: Identify the relationship between angles BOE and AOE.**
    * Angles BOE and AOE are adjacent angles, meaning they share a common vertex (O) and a common side (OE).
    * The sum of adjacent angles on a straight line is 180 degrees.
    * Therefore, angle BOE + angle AOE = 180 degrees.

* **Step 5: Solve for angle AOE.**
    * Angle AOE = 180 degrees - angle BOE = 180 degrees - 35 degrees = 145 degrees.

3. **Answer:** Angle AOE = 145 degrees.

What is the $x$ component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3?",0.17,"1. **Problem:** What is the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 due to the other four particles?

2. **Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**
    * Particle 1 exerts a force on particle 3 in the negative x-direction.
    * Particle 2 exerts a force on particle 3 in the positive x-direction.
    * Particle 4 exerts a force on particle 3 in the negative x-direction.
    * Particle 3 does not exert a force on itself.

* **Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of each force using Coulomb's Law.**

132,如图，在4×4的正方形网格中，每个小正方形的边长均为1，点A，B，C都在格点上，AD⊥BC于D，则AD的长为（）,2,"1. **Problem:**  Find the length of line segment AD in the given diagram.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Identify the relevant triangles.**
      * We have a right triangle ABC, with right angle at D.
      * We also have two smaller right triangles: ABD and ACD.

   * **Step 2: Determine the lengths of the sides of the triangles.**
      *  From the grid, we can see that:
         * AB has a length of 4 units (4 grid squares vertically).
         * BC has a length of 3 units (3 grid squares horizontally).

   * **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.**
      * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
      *  For triangle ABC:
         *  AB² + BC² = AC²
         *  4² + 3² = AC²
         *  16 + 9 = AC²
         *  AC² = 25
         *  AC = √25 = 5 units

   * **Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem again for triangle ABD.**
      *  AB² = AD² + BD²
      *  4² = AD² + BD²
      *  16 = AD² + BD²

   * **Step 5: Use the Pythagorean Theorem for triangle ACD.**
      *  AC² = AD² + CD²
      *  5² = AD² + CD²
      *  25 = AD² + CD²

   * **Step 6:  Solve for AD.**
      *  We have two equations with two unknowns (AD and BD or CD). We can solve for AD by subtracting the equation from Step 4 from the equation in Step 5:
         *  25 - 16 = (AD² + CD²) - (AD² + BD²)
         *  9 = CD² - BD²
      *  Since CD and BD are the lengths of the horizontal and vertical sides of a rectangle, we know that CD = BD + 3.  Substituting this into the equation above:
         *  9 = (BD + 3)² - BD²
         *  9 = BD² + 6BD + 9 - BD²
         *  0 = 6BD
         *  BD = 0
      *  Since BD = 0, we can substitute this back into the equation from Step 4:
         *  16 = AD² + 0²
         *  AD² = 16
         *  AD = √16 = 4 units

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Find angle BCD.** Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle BCD is half of angle ACB.  We know angle DBC is 54 degrees, and since BD is perpendicular to CD, angle BDC is 90 degrees.  The angles in triangle BCD add up to 180 degrees, so angle BCD = 180 - 90 - 54 = 36 degrees.

   * **Step 2: Find angle ACB.** Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle ACB is twice angle BCD. Therefore, angle ACB = 2 * 36 = 72 degrees.

   * **Step 3: Find angle CBD.**  Angle CBD is the complement of angle DBC, so angle CBD = 90 - 54 = 36 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Find angle ABD.**  We know angle A equals angle ABD, and angle ABD is the complement of angle CBD. Therefore, angle ABD = 90 - 36 = 54 degrees.

   * **Step 5: Find angle A.** Since angle A equals angle ABD, angle A = 54 degrees.

2. **Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Draw a diagram.**  Draw parallelogram ABCD with the angle bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCD intersecting AD at points E and F, respectively.

* **Step 2: Use angle bisector properties.** Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE. Similarly, since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, we have ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

* **Step 3: Identify congruent triangles.**  Triangles ABE and CBE share side BE and have equal angles (∠ABE = ∠CBE and ∠BAE = ∠BCE, since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal). Therefore, triangles ABE and CBE are congruent by the Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) congruence theorem. Similarly, triangles DCF and BCF are congruent by AAS.

* **Step 4: Use congruent triangles to find AE and DF.** Since triangles ABE and CBE are congruent, AE = CE. Since triangles DCF and BCF are congruent, DF = BF.

* **Step 5: Apply the properties of parallelograms.** In parallelogram ABCD, opposite sides are equal, so AD = BC = 4.  Therefore, AE + CE = AD = 4, and DF + BF = BC = 4.

* **Step 6: Find EF.** Since AE = CE and DF = BF, we have AE = CE = 2 and DF = BF = 2. Therefore, EF = AE + DF = 2 + 2 = 4.

82,A square is inscribed in a circle of area 18$\pi$ square units. Find the length of a side of the square.,6,"1. **Problem:** What is the length of a side of a square inscribed in a circle with an area of 18π square units?

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1:** Find the radius of the circle.
        * The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.
        * We know the area is 18π square units, so we can plug that into the formula: 18π = πr²
        * Divide both sides by π: 18 = r²
        * Take the square root of both sides: √18 = r
        * Simplify the radical: 3√2 = r
    * **Step 2:** Relate the radius to the side of the square.
        * The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
        * The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is 2 * 3√2 = 6√2.
        * The diagonal of a square divides it into two 45-45-90 right triangles.
        * In a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of a leg.
        * Therefore, the side of the square (which is a leg of the triangle) is equal to the diagonal divided by √2: (6√2) / √2 = 6.

2. **Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Draw a diagram.**  Draw triangle ABC with the given information.  Since N is the midpoint of BC, BN = NC.  Since AM bisects angle BAC, angle BAM = angle MAC.  Since BM is perpendicular to AM, angle BMA = 90 degrees.

* **Step 2: Identify similar triangles.**  Triangles AMB and AMC are similar because they share angle A and both have a right angle.

* **Step 3: Use the properties of similar triangles.**  Since triangles AMB and AMC are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal.  This means:

    * AB/AC = BM/MC

* **Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem.**  In right triangle BMN, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BM:

    * BM² = BN² - MN²
    * BM² = (BC/2)² - 2² 
    * BM² = (AB + AC/2)² - 4  (Since BN = BC/2 and BC = AB + AC)

* **Step 5: Substitute and solve for AC.**  Substitute the values we know into the equation from Step 3:

    * 8/AC = BM/MC
    * 8/AC = √((AB + AC/2)² - 4) / MC

    Since we don't know MC, we need to find a way to express it in terms of AC.  Notice that MC = AC - AM.  We can find AM using the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle AMN:

    * AM² = AN² - MN²
    * AM² = (AC/2)² - 2²  (Since AN = AC/2)

    Now we can substitute MC = AC - AM into the equation from Step 5:

    * 8/AC = √((AB + AC/2)² - 4) / (AC - √((AC/2)² - 4))

    This equation is a bit messy, but we can solve it by simplifying and squaring both sides.  After some algebraic manipulation, we get:

    * AC² - 16AC + 64 = 0

    This is a quadratic equation that we can solve using the quadratic formula:

    * AC = (16 ± √(16² - 4 * 64)) / 2
    * AC = (16 ± √0) / 2
    * AC = 8

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Identify the relevant geometric shapes:** We have a circle with a diameter $CE$ and a radius $AB$.  We also have a right triangle $BDE$ where $BD$ is the altitude.
    * **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:** In right triangle $BDE$, we know that $BE$ is half of $CE$, so $BE = 13.5/2 = 6.75$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $BD$:
        * $BD^2 + DE^2 = BE^2$
        * $BD^2 = BE^2 - DE^2$
    * **Find DE:** Since $AB$ is a radius and $BD$ is an altitude, we know that $AD = BD$.  Therefore, $DE = CE - AD = CE - BD$.
    * **Substitute and solve for BD:** Substitute the value of $DE$ into the equation from step 2:
        * $BD^2 = BE^2 - (CE - BD)^2$
        * $BD^2 = 6.75^2 - (13.5 - BD)^2$
        * $BD^2 = 45.5625 - (182.25 - 27BD + BD^2)$
        * $2BD^2 + 27BD - 136.6875 = 0$
    * **Use the quadratic formula:**  We can solve for $BD$ using the quadratic formula:
        * $BD = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
        * Where $a = 2$, $b = 27$, and $c = -136.6875$
        * $BD = \dfrac{-27 \pm \sqrt{27^2 - 4(2)(-136.6875)}}{2(2)}$
        * $BD = \dfrac{-27 \pm \sqrt{1593.5}}{4}$

2. **Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
    * We are given that AO is parallel to BC. This means that angle AOB and angle BOC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees).
    * We are also given that angle AOB is 40 degrees.
* **Step 2: Calculate angle BOC.**
    * Since angle AOB and angle BOC are supplementary, we can find angle BOC by subtracting angle AOB from 180 degrees:
        * angle BOC = 180 degrees - 40 degrees = 140 degrees
* **Step 3: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
    * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * In this case, angle OAC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BC.
    * Therefore, angle OAC is half the measure of angle BOC:
        * angle OAC = (1/2) * angle BOC = (1/2) * 140 degrees = 70 degrees

2. **Solution Steps:**

* **Understanding the Properties of a Rhombus:**
    * All sides of a rhombus are equal. Therefore, AB = BC = CD = DA = 5.
    * The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. This means that AO = OC and BO = OD, and angles AOB, BOC, COD, and DOA are all right angles.
* **Using the Midpoint Theorem:**
    * The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
    * Applying this to triangle ABD, we see that EF is parallel to BD and EF = 1/2 BD.
* **Finding BD:**
    * Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BD.
    * In right triangle AOB, we have AO = AC/2 = 6/2 = 3 and AB = 5.
    * Using the Pythagorean theorem:  BO² = AB² - AO² = 5² - 3² = 16.
    * Therefore, BO = √16 = 4.
    * Since BO = OD, we have BD = BO + OD = 4 + 4 = 8.
* **Calculating EF:**
    * We know EF = 1/2 BD.
    * Therefore, EF = 1/2 * 8 = 4.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Understanding Angle Bisectors:** Angle bisectors divide an angle into two equal angles. Therefore, ∠ABO = ∠CBO and ∠ACO = ∠BCO.

   * **Angle Sum Property of a Triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, in triangle ABC: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.

   * **Finding ∠B + ∠C:**  Substituting the given value of ∠A: 110° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.  Therefore, ∠B + ∠C = 70°.

   * **Focusing on Triangle BOC:**  In triangle BOC, we have: ∠BOC + ∠OBC + ∠OCB = 180°.

   * **Using Angle Bisectors:**  Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, we know: ∠OBC = (1/2)∠B and ∠OCB = (1/2)∠C.

   * **Substituting and Solving:**  Substituting these values into the equation for triangle BOC: ∠BOC + (1/2)∠B + (1/2)∠C = 180°.  We know ∠B + ∠C = 70°, so: ∠BOC + (1/2)(70°) = 180°.  Simplifying: ∠BOC + 35° = 180°.  Therefore, ∠BOC = 145°.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Find ∠A.**
      * Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, we have: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.
      * Substituting the given values: ∠A + 58° + 90° = 180°.
      * Solving for ∠A: ∠A = 180° - 58° - 90° = 32°.

   * **Step 2: Find ∠2.**
      * Since line a is parallel to line b, ∠2 and ∠A are corresponding angles.
      * Corresponding angles formed by parallel lines are equal. Therefore, ∠2 = ∠A = 32°.

   * **Step 3: Find ∠1.**
      * ∠1 and ∠B are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°) because they form a straight line.
      * Therefore, ∠1 + ∠B = 180°.
      * Substituting the value of ∠B: ∠1 + 58° = 180°.
      * Solving for ∠1: ∠1 = 180° - 58° = 122°.

   * **Step 4: Calculate ∠1 - ∠2.**

2. **Solution Steps:**

* **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the points M and N on the sides BC and CD respectively, such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized. This means we need to find the shortest possible path from A to M to N and back to A.

* **Key Insight:** The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Therefore, to minimize the perimeter of △AMN, we need to make AM and AN straight lines. This means M and N should be the feet of the perpendiculars drawn from A to BC and CD respectively.

* **Finding ∠AMN and ∠ANM:**
    * Since AM is perpendicular to BC, ∠AMB = 90°.
    * Since AN is perpendicular to CD, ∠AND = 90°.
    * In triangle AMB, ∠BAM = 180° - ∠BAD - ∠AMB = 180° - 120° - 90° = -30°. This is not possible, so we need to consider the other side of AD. ∠BAM = 180° - ∠BAD = 180° - 120° = 60°.
    * Therefore, ∠AMN = 180° - ∠AMB - ∠BAM = 180° - 90° - 60° = 30°.
    * Similarly, in triangle AND, ∠DAN = 180° - ∠BAD = 180° - 120° = 60°.
    * Therefore, ∠ANM = 180° - ∠AND - ∠DAN = 180° - 90° - 60° = 30°.

* **Calculating ∠AMN + ∠ANM:**

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Understanding the Concept:** The center of mass of a uniform object is the point where the object can be balanced perfectly. For a triangle, the center of mass is located at the centroid, which is the point where the medians of the triangle intersect.
    * **Finding the Median:** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. In an isosceles right triangle, the median drawn from the right angle vertex divides the triangle into two congruent right triangles.
    * **Centroid Location:** The centroid of a triangle is located one-third of the way from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
    * **Calculating the y-coordinate:** Since the triangle is isosceles, the y-coordinate of the centroid will be one-third of the height of the triangle. The height of the triangle is equal to the length of one of the legs, which is 'a'. Therefore, the y-coordinate of the centroid is (1/3) * a.

    * **Understanding the Relationship:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, $∠ABC$ is an inscribed angle that intercepts both $\widehat{A C}$ and $\widehat{A D C}$.
    * **Setting up the Equation:**  We can write the following equation based on the relationship above:

    *  ∠ACO = 90° (Radius drawn to a tangent is perpendicular to the tangent)
    *  ∠BAC = 90° (Angle in a semicircle is a right angle)

    *  ∠ACD = ∠ACB + ∠BCD = 90° + ∠BCO + ∠BCD
    *  ∠BCO = ∠BDC (Angles subtended by the same arc are equal)
    *  ∠BCD = ∠BDC (Angles subtended by the same arc are equal)

* **Step 2: Apply the angle sum property of a triangle.**
    *  In triangle ACE, ∠ACE + ∠CAE + ∠AEC = 180°
    *  Substituting the known values, 25° + 90° + ∠AEC = 180°

    * Similarly, since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, ∠ABE = ∠CBE = (1/2)∠ABC.

* **Step 4: Apply angle relationships.**
    * In triangle BFC, we can express ∠BFC as: ∠BFC = 180° - ∠FBC - ∠FCB.
    * We know ∠FBC = ∠CBE = (1/2)∠ABC and ∠FCB = ∠ACD = (1/2)∠ACB.
    * Therefore, ∠BFC = 180° - (1/2)∠ABC - (1/2)∠ACB.

* **Step 5: Use the angle sum property of triangle ABC.**
    * In triangle ABC, ∠ABC + ∠ACB + ∠BAC = 180°.
    * Substituting this into the equation for ∠BFC, we get: ∠BFC = 180° - (1/2)(180° - ∠BAC) = 90° + (1/2)∠BAC.

* **Step 6: Find ∠BAC.**
    * We know ∠GAC = 58°.
    * Since CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, ∠ACD = ∠BCD = (1/2)∠ACB.
    * Therefore, ∠BAC = ∠GAC + ∠ACD = 58° + (1/2)∠ACB.

* **Step 7: Substitute and solve for ∠BFC.**
    * Substituting the value of ∠BAC into the equation for ∠BFC, we get: ∠BFC = 90° + (1/2)(58° + (1/2)∠ACB) = 90° + 29° + (1/4)∠ACB = 119° + (1/4)∠ACB.

* **Step 8: Use the angle sum property of triangle ABC again.**
    * In triangle ABC, ∠ABC + ∠ACB + ∠BAC = 180°.
    * Substituting the value of ∠BAC, we get: ∠ABC + ∠ACB + (58° + (1/2)∠ACB) = 180°.
    * Simplifying, we get: ∠ABC + (3/2)∠ACB = 122°.

* **Step 9: Solve for ∠ACB.**
    * We don't have enough information to directly solve for ∠ABC or ∠ACB. However, we can express ∠ACB in terms of ∠ABC: ∠ACB = (2/3)(122° - ∠ABC).

* **Step 10: Substitute and find ∠BFC.**
    * Substituting the expression for ∠ACB into the equation for ∠BFC, we get: ∠BFC = 119° + (1/4)(2/3)(122",False,0,8.775713205337524,1377.0
