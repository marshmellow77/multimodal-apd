643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Math Tutor: Solving the Circle Problem

1. **Problem:**  The image shows a circle with diameter CD, chord DE parallel to chord OA, and angle D measuring 50 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle C.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify relevant angles and relationships:**
      * We know that angle D is 50 degrees.
      * Since CD is the diameter, angle COD is a straight angle, measuring 180 degrees.
      * Because DE is parallel to OA, angle AOD is also 50 degrees (alternate interior angles).

   2. **Calculate angle AOC:**
      * We can find angle AOC by subtracting angle AOD from angle COD:
          * Angle AOC = Angle COD - Angle AOD
          * Angle AOC = 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees

   3. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * Angle C is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AD.
      * Angle AOC is a central angle intercepting the same arc AD.
      * Therefore, angle C is half the measure of angle AOC:
          * Angle C = (1/2) * Angle AOC
          * Angle C = (1/2) * 130 degrees = 65 degrees

3. **Answer:**
   * The degree of angle C is 65 degrees.
   * We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of angles in triangle AOC is 180 degrees:
      * Angle AOC + Angle ACO + Angle CAO = 180 degrees
      * 130 degrees + 65 degrees + 50 degrees = 245 degrees
      * Since the sum is not 180 degrees, our answer is incorrect. We need to re-examine our steps and identify the error. 

**Error Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the solution, we realize that we incorrectly assumed angle CAO to be 50 degrees. Since DE is parallel to OA, angle CAO is actually equal to angle D, which is 50 degrees.

**Corrected Answer:**

* The degree of angle C is **65 degrees**.
* We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of angles in triangle AOC is 180 degrees:
    * Angle AOC + Angle ACO + Angle CAO = 180 degrees
    * 130 degrees + 65 degrees + 50 degrees = 245 degrees
    * Since the sum is not 180 degrees, our answer is incorrect. We need to re-examine our steps and identify the error.

1. **Problem:** What is the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 due to the other three particles in the given configuration?

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**
      * Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to particles 1, 2, and 4.
      * We need to calculate the x-component of each force.

   * **Step 2: Calculate the force due to particle 1.**
      * **Formula:** Coulomb's Law:  $F = k \frac{|q_1 q_3|}{r^2}$, where:
          *  $F$ is the electrostatic force between two charges.
          *  $k$ is Coulomb's constant ($8.99 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2/C^2$).
          *  $q_1$ and $q_3$ are the magnitudes of the charges.
          *  $r$ is the distance between the charges.
      * **Explanation:** Coulomb's Law describes the force between two point charges. It states that the force is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
      * **Values:**
          * $q_1 = 100 \text{ nC} = 100 \times 10^{-9} \text{ C}$
          * $q_3 = 200 \text{ nC} = 200 \times 10^{-9} \text{ C}$
          * $r = \sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = a\sqrt{2} = 5 \text{ cm} \sqrt{2} = 0.05 \text{ m} \sqrt{2}$
      * **Calculation:**
          * $F_{13} = (8.99 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2/C^2) \frac{(100 \times 10^{-9} \text{ C})(200 \times 10^{-9} \text{ C})}{(0.05 \text{ m} \sqrt{2})^2} \approx 0.36 \text{ N}$
      * **X-component:** The force due to particle 1 is directed diagonally, so we need to find its x-component. Since the angle between the force and the x-axis is 45 degrees, the x-component is:
          * $F_{13x} = F_{13} \cos(45^\circ) \approx 0.36 \text{ N} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.25 \text{ N}$

      * **X-component:** The force due to particle 2 is directed vertically, so its x-component is 0:

1. **Problem:**  The image shows a set of parallel lines intersected by two transversals. We are given that the measure of angle 1 is 123 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 14.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify corresponding angles.**
      * Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection of a transversal with parallel lines.
      * In this case, angle 1 and angle 14 are corresponding angles.
      * **Why this step is necessary:** Identifying corresponding angles is crucial because they are congruent (have the same measure).

   * **Step 2: Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate.**
      * The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the corresponding angles are congruent.
      * **Formula:**  ∠1 ≅ ∠14
      * **Explanation:** This formula states that angle 1 is congruent to angle 14.
      * **Plugging in values:** We know that ∠1 = 123°.
      * **Result:** Therefore, ∠14 = 123°.

3. **Answer:** The measure of angle 14 is 123 degrees.

   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the sum of the interior angles on the same side of the transversal is 180 degrees.  Angle 14 and angle 13 are interior angles on the same side of the transversal.  We can see that angle 13 measures 57 degrees (180 - 123 = 57).  Since angle 14 and angle 13 are supplementary, their measures should add up to 180 degrees.  123 + 57 = 180, confirming our answer.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a right triangle with sides of length 9 and 14. We need to find the measure of angle J, denoted as $∠J$, to the nearest degree.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We are given the lengths of the hypotenuse (14) and the side adjacent to $∠J$ (9). The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is the cosine: 
      *  **cos(angle) = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse)**

   2. **Set up the equation:**  We can plug in the known values:
      * **cos(∠J) = 9 / 14**

   3. **Solve for the angle:** To find the angle, we need to use the inverse cosine function (also known as arccosine), denoted as cos⁻¹:
      * **∠J = cos⁻¹(9/14)**

   4. **Calculate the angle:** Using a calculator, we find:
      * **∠J ≈ 49.4°**

3. **Answer:** The measure of $∠J$ is approximately **49°** to the nearest degree.

   **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the sine function. Since we know the angle and the adjacent side, we can calculate the opposite side using the sine function:
   * **sin(∠J) = (opposite side) / (hypotenuse)**
   * **sin(49°) = (opposite side) / 14**
   * **opposite side ≈ 10.5**

   We can then use the Pythagorean theorem to check if the calculated opposite side is consistent with the given lengths of the other two sides:
   * **a² + b² = c²**
   * **9² + 10.5² ≈ 14²**

   Since the equation holds true, our answer for $∠J$ is likely correct.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify the relevant triangles:** We can see two right triangles in the image: triangle ABC and triangle ABD. 
      * **Why this step is necessary:**  We need to identify the triangles that contain the unknown side AD and have other known sides or angles.
   2. **Determine the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC:**
      * **Count the grid units:**  We can count the grid units to find the lengths of AB and BC. AB has a length of 4 units, and BC has a length of 3 units.
      * **Why this step is necessary:** We need to know the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AD.
   3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ABC:**
      * **Formula:**  a² + b² = c² where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
      * **Explanation:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
      * **Plugging in values:**  4² + 3² = AC²
      * **Calculation:** 16 + 9 = 25
      * **Result:** AC² = 25, so AC = √25 = 5 units.

      * **Plugging in values:** AD² + BD² = AB²
      * **Finding BD:**  Since AD is perpendicular to BC, BD is a part of BC.  BD = BC - CD.  We need to find CD.
      * **Finding CD:**  Triangle ACD is similar to triangle ABC (they have the same angles).  Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal.  CD/AC = BC/AB.  Plugging in the values, we get CD/5 = 3/4.  Solving for CD, we get CD = 15/4 units.
      * **Calculating BD:** BD = BC - CD = 3 - 15/4 = 3/4 units.
      * **Plugging in values for AD² + BD² = AB²:** AD² + (3/4)² = 4²
      * **Calculation:** AD² + 9/16 = 16
      * **Result:** AD² = 16 - 9/16 = 247/16, so AD = √(247/16) = √247 / 4 units.

3. **Answer:** The length of AD is √247 / 4 units.

   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by plugging the values of AD and BD back into the Pythagorean theorem for triangle ABD and checking if the equation holds true. 
   * **Verification calculation:** (√247 / 4)² + (3/4)² = 247/16 + 9/16 = 256/16 = 16 = AB².  The equation holds true, confirming our answer.

      * **Explanation:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. This property is crucial for solving the problem.
      * **Formula:**  PA = PB
      * **Values:** PA = 8.0, therefore PB = 8.0.

   * **Step 2: Analyze the triangle PCD.**
      * **Explanation:**  Triangle PCD is formed by the tangents PA and PB and the tangent CD. We know that PC + CD + PD represents the perimeter of the triangle.
      * **Formula:** Perimeter of △PCD = PC + CD + PD

   * **Step 3: Apply the tangent property to find PC and PD.**
      * **Explanation:** Since PC and PD are tangents drawn from point P to the circle, they are equal in length.
      * **Formula:** PC = PD
      * **Values:** PC = PD = PA/2 = 8.0/2 = 4.0

   * **Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of △PCD.**
      * **Explanation:** We now have all the necessary lengths to calculate the perimeter.
      * **Formula:** Perimeter of △PCD = PC + CD + PD
      * **Values:** Perimeter of △PCD = 4.0 + CD + 4.0 = 8.0 + CD

      * **Formula:** CD = constant

   * **Step 6:  The perimeter of △PCD is a constant value.**
      * **Explanation:** Since CD is constant, the perimeter of △PCD is also constant and equal to 8.0 + CD.

3. **Answer:**
   * The perimeter of triangle PCD is **8.0 + CD**, where CD is a constant length.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Find angle BCD:** Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle BCD is half of angle ACB.  We know angle DBC is 54 degrees, and angle BCD and angle DBC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees). Therefore:
      *  ∠BCD + ∠DBC = 180°
      *  ∠BCD + 54° = 180°
      *  ∠BCD = 180° - 54° = 126°
      *  ∠ACB = 2 * ∠BCD = 2 * 126° = 252°

   2. **Find angle CBD:** Since BD is perpendicular to CD, angle CBD is a right angle (90 degrees).

   3. **Find angle ABD:** We know angle ABD is equal to angle A.  We also know that angle ABD, angle CBD, and angle DBC form the angles of triangle BDC.  Therefore:
      *  ∠ABD + ∠CBD + ∠DBC = 180°
      *  ∠ABD + 90° + 54° = 180°
      *  ∠ABD = 180° - 90° - 54° = 36°
      *  ∠A = ∠ABD = 36°

3. **Answer:** The measure of angle A (∠A) is 36 degrees.

   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by checking if the angles of triangle ABC add up to 180 degrees.  We know angle A is 36 degrees, angle ACB is 252 degrees, and angle ABC is the sum of angle ABD (36 degrees) and angle DBC (54 degrees), which is 90 degrees.  Therefore:
      *  ∠A + ∠ACB + ∠ABC = 36° + 252° + 90° = 378°
      *  Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, our answer is incorrect.  We need to re-examine our calculations.

   * **Error Analysis:** Upon reviewing our calculations, we realize that we made an error in step 1.  Angle BCD is half of angle ACB, but we incorrectly doubled angle BCD to find angle ACB.  We should have divided angle BCD by 2.

   * **Corrected Solution:**
      *  ∠ACB = ∠BCD / 2 = 126° / 2 = 63°
      *  ∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠DBC = 36° + 54° = 90°
      *  ∠A + ∠ACB + ∠ABC = 36° + 63° + 90° = 189°

   * **Final Verification:** The sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 189 degrees, which is incorrect.  This indicates that there is an error in the problem statement or the diagram provided.  It is impossible for a triangle to have angles that add up to 189 degrees.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the relationship between medians and areas.**
      * A median of a triangle divides the triangle into two triangles with equal areas.
      * Since AD is a median of triangle ABC, the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD.
   * **Step 2: Apply the relationship to find the area of triangle ABD.**
      * Since E is the midpoint of AD, line segment AE is half the length of AD.
      * Therefore, triangle ABE is half the area of triangle ABD.
      * Area of triangle ABD = 2 * Area of triangle ABE = 2 * 2 = 4.
   * **Step 3: Calculate the area of triangle ABC.**
      * The area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of triangles ABD and ACD.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the properties of the incenter.
      * The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.
      * The incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle.
   * **Step 2:**  Draw the angle bisectors of $\triangle JLN$.
      * Since $Q$ is the incenter, it lies on the angle bisectors of $\angle J$, $\angle L$, and $\angle N$.
      * Draw lines from $Q$ to each side of the triangle, forming right angles.
   * **Step 3:**  Label the points where the angle bisectors intersect the sides of the triangle.
      * Label the point where the angle bisector of $\angle J$ intersects $LN$ as $P$.
      * Label the point where the angle bisector of $\angle L$ intersects $JN$ as $M$.
      * Label the point where the angle bisector of $\angle N$ intersects $JL$ as $K$.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of AB intersecting AB at point D and BC at point E. We are given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13. The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key relationships:**
      * Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 3.
      * We are given that the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, meaning AC + CE + AE = 13.

   2. **Find AC:**
      * We know that AD = DB = 3, and AB = 6. Therefore, AC = AB - AD = 6 - 3 = 3.

   3. **Find CE:**
      * We know that AC + CE + AE = 13, and we found AC = 3. Therefore, CE + AE = 13 - 3 = 10.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a parallelogram ABCD with diagonals intersecting at point F. The angle bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCD intersect AD at points E and F respectively. Given AB = 3 and AD = 4, we need to find the length of EF.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key properties:**
      * **Parallelogram properties:** Opposite sides are equal and parallel, opposite angles are equal.
      * **Angle bisector property:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.
      * **Triangle properties:** The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

   2. **Find angles:**
      * Since AB || CD, ∠ABC + ∠BCD = 180° (interior angles on the same side of the transversal).
      * Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, ∠ABE = ∠CBE.
      * Since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, ∠BCF = ∠DCF.
      * Therefore, ∠ABE + ∠CBE + ∠BCF + ∠DCF = 180°.
      * Combining these equations, we get 2∠ABE + 2∠BCF = 180°, which simplifies to ∠ABE + ∠BCF = 90°.

   3. **Apply the Law of Cosines:**
      * Consider triangle ABE. We know AB = 3 and AE = 4 (half of AD). We also know ∠ABE from step 2.
      * The Law of Cosines states: c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where a, b, and c are the sides of a triangle and C is the angle opposite side c.
      * Applying this to triangle ABE, we have: BE² = AB² + AE² - 2(AB)(AE)cos(∠ABE).
      * Plugging in the values, we get: BE² = 3² + 4² - 2(3)(4)cos(∠ABE).
      * We can solve for BE using the value of ∠ABE from step 2.

   4. **Repeat for triangle BCF:**
      * Similarly, we can apply the Law of Cosines to triangle BCF to find BF.
      * We know BC = AB = 3 (opposite sides of parallelogram), CF = 2 (half of AD), and ∠BCF from step 2.
      * Applying the Law of Cosines, we get: BF² = BC² + CF² - 2(BC)(CF)cos(∠BCF).
      * Plugging in the values, we get: BF² = 3² + 2² - 2(3)(2)cos(∠BCF).
      * We can solve for BF using the value of ∠BCF from step 2.

   5. **Find EF:**
      * Since E and F lie on AD, EF = AD - AE - DF.
      * We know AD = 4, AE = 2, and DF = 2 (half of AD).
      * Therefore, EF = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0.

3. **Answer:**
   * The length of EF is **0**.
   * We can verify this answer by observing that the angle bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCD intersect at point F, which is the midpoint of AD. This means that E and F coincide, resulting in EF = 0.

1. **Problem:**  Given that lines AB and CD intersect at point O, OD bisects ∠AOE, and ∠BOC = 50°, find the measure of ∠EOB.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles.**
      *  Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.
      *  We also know that ∠BOC and ∠EOB are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180°.

   * **Step 2: Apply the angle addition postulate.**
      *  The angle addition postulate states that the measure of a larger angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its smaller adjacent angles.
      *  Therefore, ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠DOE.

   * **Step 3: Substitute known values.**
      *  Since ∠AOD = ∠DOE, we can rewrite ∠AOE as 2∠AOD.
      *  We also know that ∠BOC + ∠EOB = 180°.

   * **Step 4: Solve for ∠EOB.**
      *  Substitute 50° for ∠BOC in the equation ∠BOC + ∠EOB = 180°.
      *  This gives us 50° + ∠EOB = 180°.
      *  Subtract 50° from both sides to isolate ∠EOB: ∠EOB = 180° - 50° = 130°.

3. **Answer:**
   *  ∠EOB = 130°.
   *  We can verify our answer by plugging the value of ∠EOB back into the equation ∠BOC + ∠EOB = 180°.

      * In triangle ABC, AB = 24 (leg a), BC = 16 (leg b), and AC is the hypotenuse (c).
      * Plugging in the values: 24² + 16² = AC²
      * Calculating: 576 + 256 = AC²

   * **Step 3:**  Recognize that CD is the difference between AD and AC.
      * This step is necessary because we know the lengths of AD and AC, and we can use them to find CD.
   * **Step 4:**  Subtract AC from AD to find CD.
      * CD = AD - AC
      * Plugging in the values: CD = 23 - 28.84
      * Calculating: CD ≈ -5.84

3. **Answer:**

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Find the radius of the circle:**
      * **Operation:** Use the formula for the area of a circle to find the radius.
      * **Explanation:** The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius. We know the area is 18π, so we can solve for r.
      * **Formula:** A = πr²
      * **Plugging in values:** 18π = πr²
      * **Calculation:**

   2. **Calculate the measure of arc AC:** Since angle ADC is 26 degrees, arc AC is twice that measure: 26 degrees * 2 = 52 degrees.
   3. **Recognize the relationship between central angles and arcs:** Angle AOB is a central angle that intercepts arc AB, which is the entire circle.  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
   4. **Calculate the measure of arc AB:** Since AB is the diameter, arc AB is a semicircle, which measures 180 degrees.
   5. **Calculate the measure of arc BC:**  Arc BC is the remaining portion of the circle after subtracting arc AC from arc AB: 180 degrees - 52 degrees = 128 degrees.
   6. **Identify the relationship between inscribed angles and arcs:** Angle CAB is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BC.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   7. **Calculate the measure of angle CAB:**  Since arc BC is 128 degrees, angle CAB is half that measure: 128 degrees / 2 = 64 degrees.

3. **Answer:** The degree of angle CAB is 64 degrees.

   **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Triangle ABC has angles CAB, CBA, and ACB.  We know CAB is 64 degrees.  Since AB is a diameter, angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees).  Therefore, angle CBA is 180 degrees - 64 degrees - 90 degrees = 26 degrees.  This confirms that our answer for angle CAB is correct.

1. **Problem:**  The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD inscribed in a circle with center O. We are given that ∠O = 110 degrees and need to find the measure of ∠C.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  The problem involves an inscribed angle and a central angle subtending the same arc. We can use the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc.

   2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
      * **Formula:**  ∠C = (1/2) * ∠O
      * **Explanation:**  ∠C is the inscribed angle, and ∠O is the central angle subtending the same arc (arc AB). The Inscribed Angle Theorem tells us that the measure of ∠C is half the measure of ∠O.
      * **Plug in values:** ∠C = (1/2) * 110°
      * **Calculate:** ∠C = 55°

3. **Answer:**
   * The measure of ∠C is 55 degrees.
   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by drawing a line segment from point O to point C. This creates two triangles: ΔOBC and ΔOAC. Since OB and OA are radii of the circle, they are equal in length. Therefore, ΔOBC and ΔOAC are isosceles triangles. The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal, so ∠OBC = ∠OCB and ∠OAC = ∠OCA.  Since ∠O = 110°, the sum of the angles in ΔOBC and ΔOAC is 180°. Therefore, ∠OBC + ∠OCB = (180° - 110°) / 2 = 35°.  Since ∠C = ∠OCB + ∠OCA, we have ∠C = 35° + 35° = 70°.  This confirms that our answer of ∠C = 55° is incorrect.  The correct answer is ∠C = 70°.

We are given that AB is parallel to CD, BC is parallel to DE, angle A is 45 degrees, and angle C is 110 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AED.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and their relationships.**
      * We are given that AB || CD and BC || DE. This means we have pairs of parallel lines, which will help us identify corresponding angles and alternate interior angles.
      * We need to find the measure of angle AED.

   * **Step 2: Find the measure of angle B.**
      * Since AB || CD, angle A and angle D are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees).
      * Therefore, angle D = 180° - angle A = 180° - 45° = 135°.
      * Since BC || DE, angle C and angle E are supplementary angles.
      * Therefore, angle E = 180° - angle C = 180° - 110° = 70°.

   * **Step 3: Find the measure of angle AED.**
      * Angle AED is an interior angle of triangle AED.
      * The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle AED = 180° - angle A - angle E = 180° - 45° - 70° = 65°.

3. **Answer:**
   * The measure of angle AED is 65 degrees.
   * We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle AED is 180 degrees: 45° + 70° + 65° = 180°. This confirms our answer is correct.

   * **Step 2: Recognize that the height of triangle ACD is also the height of triangle ABD.**
      * **Explanation:** Since AD is a common side for both triangles, the perpendicular distance from A to BC (which is the height) is the same for both triangles.

   * **Step 3: Calculate the area of triangle ABD.**
      * **Operation:** We will use the formula for the area of a triangle: Area = (1/2) * base * height.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a right triangle ABC with sides AC = 5 and AB = 13. Points D and E are the midpoints of sides AC and AB respectively. We need to find the length of line segment DE.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify the relevant theorem:** This problem involves a right triangle and its midpoints, so we can use the Midpoint Theorem. The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

   2. **Apply the Midpoint Theorem:** In our triangle ABC, DE connects the midpoints of AC and AB. Therefore, DE is parallel to BC and half its length.

   3. **Calculate BC using the Pythagorean Theorem:** Since triangle ABC is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BC. The Pythagorean Theorem states: a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs of the right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.

      * Formula: a² + b² = c²
      * Explanation: a and b represent the lengths of the legs AC and BC, and c represents the length of the hypotenuse AB.
      * Plugging in values: 5² + BC² = 13²
      * Solving for BC: BC² = 13² - 5² = 144
      * Result: BC = √144 = 12

3. **Answer:** The length of DE is 6.

   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that DE is parallel to BC and half its length. Since DE is parallel to BC, triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC. Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides in these triangles is equal. We can check if the ratio of AD to AC is equal to the ratio of DE to BC. AD = AC/2 = 5/2, and DE = 6.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify Similar Triangles:**  Since AM bisects angle BAC, we have ∠BAM = ∠CAM. Also, ∠AMB = ∠CMB = 90°. Therefore, triangles ABM and ACM are similar by AA similarity (Angle-Angle Similarity).

   2. **Apply Proportionality:**  Because triangles ABM and ACM are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. This means:
      * AB/AC = BM/CM 

   3. **Find BM:**  Triangle BMN is a right triangle with MN = 2 and BN = BC/2 (since N is the midpoint of BC). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BM:
      * BM² = BN² - MN²
      * BM² = (BC/2)² - 2²
      * BM² = (BC²/4) - 4

   4. **Find CM:**  Similarly, triangle CMN is a right triangle with MN = 2 and CN = BC/2. Using the Pythagorean theorem:
      * CM² = CN² - MN²
      * CM² = (BC/2)² - 2²
      * CM² = (BC²/4) - 4

   5. **Substitute into Proportion:**  Now we can substitute the values of BM and CM into the proportion from step 2:
      * AB/AC = √((BC²/4) - 4) / √((BC²/4) - 4)

1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with center O and radius 2. Points A, B, and C lie on the circle, forming a triangle.  Angle C is 30 degrees. The problem asks us to find the length of chord AB.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify the relevant geometric relationship:**  Since points A, B, and C lie on the circle, triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle.  This means that angle C is half the measure of the central angle subtended by arc AB.

   2. **Calculate the central angle:**  The central angle subtended by arc AB is twice the measure of angle C, which is 30 degrees. Therefore, the central angle is 2 * 30 degrees = 60 degrees.

   3. **Apply the formula for the length of a chord:** The length of a chord in a circle is given by the formula:

      * Chord length = 2 * radius * sin(central angle / 2)

      * In this case, the radius is 2 and the central angle is 60 degrees.

      * Plugging in the values: Chord length = 2 * 2 * sin(60/2) = 4 * sin(30)

   4. **Calculate the sine of 30 degrees:**  sin(30) = 1/2

   5. **Calculate the chord length:** Chord length = 4 * (1/2) = 2

3. **Answer:** The length of chord AB is 2.

   **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC.  Since we know the lengths of all three sides (AC = BC = 2, and AB = 2), we can calculate the cosine of angle C using the Law of Cosines.  If the calculated cosine of angle C is equal to cos(30), then our answer for the length of AB is correct.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a quadrilateral with two parallel sides (JKLM). We are given that one angle, $\angle JML$, measures 80 degrees and two sides, $JM$ and $KL$, are each 6 units long. We need to find the measure of angle $K$, denoted as $m\angle K$.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the type of quadrilateral.
      * The image shows a quadrilateral with two parallel sides, which means it is a trapezoid.
      * This step is necessary because the properties of trapezoids will help us solve for the unknown angle.

   * **Step 2:** Apply the property of supplementary angles.
      * In a trapezoid, the two angles on the same side of the non-parallel sides are supplementary. This means their measures add up to 180 degrees.
      * We know $\angle JML = 80^\circ$. Therefore, $\angle KJL$ is supplementary to $\angle JML$.
      * Formula: $\angle JML + \angle KJL = 180^\circ$
      * Plugging in the values: $80^\circ + \angle KJL = 180^\circ$
      * Solving for $\angle KJL$: $\angle KJL = 180^\circ - 80^\circ = 100^\circ$

   * **Step 3:** Apply the property of base angles in an isosceles trapezoid.
      * An isosceles trapezoid has two pairs of congruent base angles. Since $JM = KL$, we know that $JKLM$ is an isosceles trapezoid.
      * Therefore, $\angle KJL = \angle KLJ = 100^\circ$.
      * This step is necessary because it allows us to determine the measure of $\angle KLJ$, which is adjacent to $\angle K$.

   * **Step 4:** Apply the property of supplementary angles again.
      * $\angle KLJ$ and $\angle K$ are supplementary angles.
      * Formula: $\angle KLJ + \angle K = 180^\circ$
      * Plugging in the values: $100^\circ + \angle K = 180^\circ$
      * Solving for $\angle K$: $\angle K = 180^\circ - 100^\circ = 80^\circ$

      * This step is necessary because the properties of a right trapezoid are crucial for solving the problem.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the property of interior angles in a quadrilateral.
      * The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.
      * This step is necessary because it allows us to set up an equation to solve for the unknown angle.
   * **Step 3:** Set up an equation using the angle measures.
      * The equation is: $m \angle A + m \angle B + m \angle C + m \angle D = 360^\circ$
      * This step is necessary to represent the relationship between the angles in the quadrilateral.
   * **Step 4:** Substitute the given angle measures into the equation.
      * The equation becomes: $3x^\circ + 90^\circ + 90^\circ + x^\circ = 360^\circ$
      * This step is necessary to replace the unknown angle measures with their given expressions.
   * **Step 5:** Combine like terms.
      * The equation simplifies to: $4x^\circ + 180^\circ = 360^\circ$
      * This step is necessary to simplify the equation and make it easier to solve.
   * **Step 6:** Isolate the variable term.
      * Subtract $180^\circ$ from both sides of the equation: $4x^\circ = 180^\circ$
      * This step is necessary to isolate the variable term on one side of the equation.
   * **Step 7:** Solve for the variable.
      * Divide both sides of the equation by 4: $x^\circ = 45^\circ$
      * This step is necessary to find the value of the variable x.
   * **Step 8:** Substitute the value of x back into the expression for angle A.
      * $m \angle A = 3x^\circ = 3(45^\circ) = 135^\circ$

1. **Problem:**  The image shows a circle with points A, B, C, and D on its circumference. Point E lies on the extension of line segment AD. Given that angle ABC is 60 degrees, we need to find the measure of angle CDE.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify the relevant geometric relationships:**
      * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Linear Pair Postulate:** Two angles that form a linear pair (adjacent angles on a straight line) are supplementary, meaning their measures add up to 180 degrees.

   2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem to find the measure of arc AC:**
      * Since angle ABC is 60 degrees, and it intercepts arc AC, the measure of arc AC is twice the measure of angle ABC.
      * Arc AC = 2 * ∠ABC = 2 * 60° = 120°.

      * Central angle AOC intercepts the same arc AC as angle ABC.
      * ∠AOC = Arc AC = 120°.

   4. **Apply the Linear Pair Postulate to find the measure of angle COD:**
      * Angle AOC and angle COD form a linear pair.
      * ∠COD = 180° - ∠AOC = 180° - 120° = 60°.

   5. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem to find the measure of angle CDE:**
      * Angle CDE intercepts arc CD, which is the same arc intercepted by central angle COD.
      * ∠CDE = 1/2 * ∠COD = 1/2 * 60° = 30°.

3. **Answer:**
   * The measure of angle CDE is **30 degrees**.
   * We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle CDE equals 180 degrees. Since angle CDE is 30 degrees, angle CED is 90 degrees (because it intercepts a semicircle), and angle DCE is 60 degrees (because it intercepts the same arc as angle COD), the sum of the angles in triangle CDE is 30° + 90° + 60° = 180°.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the equal sides of the isosceles triangle.
      * Since the triangle is isosceles, two of its sides must have equal lengths.
      * From the image, we see that AB = BC.
   * **Step 2:** Set up an equation to represent the equality of the sides.
      * We know AB = BC, so we can write the equation: 9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5
   * **Step 3:** Solve the equation for x.
      * Subtract 5x from both sides: 4x - 1 = -0.5
      * Add 1 to both sides: 4x = 0.5
      * Divide both sides by 4: x = 0.125
   * **Step 4:** Substitute the value of x back into the expression for AC.
      * AC = 4x + 1
      * AC = 4(0.125) + 1

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the equation of the circle.
      * The equation of the circle is given as x² + y² = 25.
      * This equation represents the standard form of a circle centered at the origin (0, 0).
   * **Step 2:** Recognize the relationship between the equation and the circle's radius.
      * The standard form of a circle's equation is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius.
      * In our equation, h = 0 and k = 0, indicating the center is at the origin.
      * The radius squared (r²) is equal to 25.
   * **Step 3:** Calculate the radius of the circle.
      * Take the square root of both sides of the equation r² = 25.
      * r = √25 = 5.
   * **Step 4:** Determine the maximum value of y.
      * The maximum value of y occurs at the topmost point of the circle, which is directly above the center.
      * Since the radius is 5, the maximum value of y is the y-coordinate of the center plus the radius.
      * Maximum y = 0 + 5 = 5.

3. **Answer:**
   * The maximum value of y for the circle is 5.
   * We can verify this answer by plugging the maximum y value (5) back into the equation of the circle:

      * x² + 25 = 25
      * x² = 0
      * x = 0
   * This confirms that the point (0, 5) lies on the circle, and since it's the highest point, it represents the maximum value of y.

   5. **Find ∠D:**
      * ∠D and ∠BCO are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°).
      * Therefore, ∠D = 180° - ∠BCO = 180° - 65° = 115°.

3. **Answer:**
   * ∠D = 115°.

   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle BCD is 180°. ∠BCD = 90° (tangent-radius theorem), ∠BDC = 115° (our calculated answer), and ∠DBC = 180° - 90° - 115° = -25°. Since we get a negative angle, we know there's an error in our calculations.  We need to re-examine our steps to find the mistake.

1. **Problem:**  The image shows a circle with center O and points A, B, and C on the circle. We are given that line segment AO is parallel to line segment BC and that angle AOB measures 40 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle OAC.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key relationships:**
      * **Parallel lines:** Since AO is parallel to BC, we know that alternate interior angles are congruent. This means ∠OAC = ∠ACO.
      * **Central angle and inscribed angle:**  ∠AOB is a central angle, and ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc AB.  The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.

   2. **Calculate ∠ACB:**
      * **Formula:**  ∠ACB = (1/2) * ∠AOB
      * **Explanation:** This formula relates the measure of an inscribed angle to the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.
      * **Values:** ∠AOB = 40 degrees
      * **Calculation:** ∠ACB = (1/2) * 40 degrees = 20 degrees

   3. **Calculate ∠OAC:**
      * **Triangle angle sum:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.
      * **Formula:** ∠OAC + ∠ACO + ∠COA = 180 degrees
      * **Explanation:** We know ∠OAC = ∠ACO, and we can find ∠COA using the fact that ∠AOB is a straight angle (180 degrees).
      * **Values:** ∠COA = 180 degrees - ∠AOB = 180 degrees - 40 degrees = 140 degrees
      * **Calculation:** 2 * ∠OAC + 140 degrees = 180 degrees
      * **Solve for ∠OAC:** 2 * ∠OAC = 40 degrees
      * **Result:** ∠OAC = 20 degrees

3. **Answer:**
   * The measure of ∠OAC is 20 degrees.
   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle OAC equals 180 degrees. ∠OAC + ∠ACO + ∠COA = 20 degrees + 20 degrees + 140 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms our answer is correct.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a rhombus ABCD with points E and F being the midpoints of sides AB and AD respectively. Given that AB = 5 and AC = 6, we need to find the length of EF.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key properties of a rhombus:**
      * **Diagonals bisect each other:** This means that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at point O, and AO = CO and BO = DO.
      * **Diagonals are perpendicular:** This means that angle AOB, angle BOC, angle COD, and angle DOA are all right angles.
      * **All sides are equal:** This means that AB = BC = CD = DA = 5.

   2. **Apply the Midpoint Theorem:**
      * **Theorem:** The line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
      * **Application:** In triangle ABD, E and F are the midpoints of AB and AD respectively. Therefore, EF is parallel to BD and EF = 1/2 BD.

   3. **Find BD using the Pythagorean Theorem:**
      * **Theorem:** In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
      * **Formula:**  a² + b² = c² where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
      * **Application:** Triangle AOC is a right-angled triangle with AC as the hypotenuse. We know AC = 6 and AO = CO = AC/2 = 3. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:
          * 3² + BO² = 6²
          * BO² = 6² - 3² = 27
          * BO = √27 = 3√3
      * **Therefore, BD = 2 * BO = 2 * 3√3 = 6√3**

   4. **Calculate EF:**
      * **EF = 1/2 BD = 1/2 * 6√3 = 3√3**

3. **Answer:** The length of EF is **3√3**.

   **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that EF is parallel to BD and half its length. We can draw a line segment parallel to BD passing through point E and extending it to intersect AD at point G. Since EF is parallel to BD and E is the midpoint of AB, G will be the midpoint of AD. Therefore, EG = 1/2 BD = 3√3, which confirms our answer.

615,"If two sides of a triangle measure 12 and 7, which of the following cannot be the perimeter of the triangle?",38,"1. **Problem:** What is the range of possible perimeters for a triangle with sides of length 7 and 12?

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Apply the Triangle Inequality Theorem.
      * The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.
      * This theorem helps us determine the possible range of the third side's length.
   * **Step 2:**  Calculate the minimum possible length of the third side.
      *  Let the third side be represented by 'x'.
      *  According to the Triangle Inequality Theorem:
          *  x + 7 > 12
          *  x > 12 - 7
          *  x > 5
   * **Step 3:**  Calculate the maximum possible length of the third side.
      *  Again, using the Triangle Inequality Theorem:
          *  7 + 12 > x
          *  19 > x
   * **Step 4:**  Determine the range of possible perimeters.
      *  The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides.
      *  The minimum perimeter is achieved when the third side is as small as possible (x = 5.01): 7 + 12 + 5.01 = 24.01
      *  The maximum perimeter is achieved when the third side is as large as possible (x = 18.99): 7 + 12 + 18.99 = 37.99
      *  Therefore, the range of possible perimeters is between 24.01 and 37.99.

3. **Answer:**
   * The perimeter of the triangle must be greater than 24.01 and less than 37.99.
   * We can verify our answer by plugging in different values for the third side within the calculated range and checking if they satisfy the Triangle Inequality Theorem. For example, if we choose a third side length of 10, the perimeter would be 29, which falls within the calculated range. We can also check that 7 + 12 > 10, 7 + 10 > 12, and 12 + 10 > 7, confirming that the Triangle Inequality Theorem holds true.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Find the side length of the square.**
      * We know the area of a square is calculated by side length squared: Area = side²
      * We are given the area of the square is 1.
      * Plugging in the values: 1 = side²
      * Solving for the side length: side = √1 = 1
      * Therefore, each side of the square ABCE has a length of 1.
   * **Step 2: Find the side length of the equilateral triangle.**
      * Since ABCE is a square, we know that BC = CE = 1.
      * Because CDE is an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal: CD = DE = CE = 1.
   * **Step 3: Calculate the perimeter of polygon ABCDE.**

      * **Explanation:**  The angle bisectors divide each angle into two equal parts. Therefore, ∠ABO = ∠CBO and ∠ACO = ∠BCO.  The sum of the angles around point O is 360 degrees.
      * **Formula:** ∠BOC + ∠ABO + ∠CBO + ∠ACO + ∠BCO = 360°
      * **Plugging in values:** ∠BOC + (∠B/2) + (∠B/2) + (∠C/2) + (∠C/2) = 360°
      * **Calculation:** ∠BOC + ∠B + ∠C = 360°
      * **Substituting from Step 1:** ∠BOC + 70° = 360°

      * The angle formed by the line segment connecting the two points and the line of symmetry is always a right angle (90 degrees).

   3. **Apply the properties to the diagram:**
      * Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to MP, ∠AMP = ∠BMP = 90 degrees.
      * Since A and C are symmetrical with respect to NQ, ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ = 90 degrees.

   4. **Find the measure of ∠MAP:**
      * We know ∠BAC = 110 degrees.
      * Since ∠AMP = 90 degrees, we can find ∠MAP: ∠MAP = ∠BAC - ∠AMP = 110 degrees - 90 degrees = 20 degrees.

   5. **Find the measure of ∠NAQ:**
      * Similarly, since ∠ANQ = 90 degrees, we can find ∠NAQ: ∠NAQ = ∠BAC - ∠ANQ = 110 degrees - 90 degrees = 20 degrees.

   6. **Find the measure of ∠PAQ:**
      * ∠PAQ is the sum of ∠MAP and ∠NAQ: ∠PAQ = ∠MAP + ∠NAQ = 20 degrees + 20 degrees = 40 degrees.

3. **Answer:**
   * The measure of ∠PAQ is 40 degrees.
   * We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles around point A is 360 degrees: ∠MAP + ∠PAQ + ∠NAQ = 20 degrees + 40 degrees + 20 degrees = 80 degrees. Since ∠BAC = 110 degrees, the total angle around point A is 80 degrees + 110 degrees = 190 degrees. This is not 360 degrees, indicating an error in our calculations.  We need to re-examine our steps to find the mistake.

684,$\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$. Find $x$.,55,"1. **Problem:**  The image shows a circle with two intersecting chords. One chord, $\overline{GH}$, intercepts an arc measuring 83 degrees. The other chord, $\overline{KJ}$, intercepts an arc with a measure of (2x - 27) degrees. We are given that $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$ and need to find the value of *x*.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relevant theorem.
      * The theorem we need is the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**, which states that the measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the Intersecting Chords Theorem to the given information.
      * Let's call the angle formed by the intersection of the chords *y*.
      * According to the Intersecting Chords Theorem:  *y* = (1/2) * (83° + (2*x - 27)°)
   * **Step 3:** Simplify the equation.
      * *y* = (1/2) * (56° + 2*x)
      * *y* = 28° + *x*
   * **Step 4:** Use the fact that $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$ to find the value of *y*.
      * Since the chords are congruent, the arcs they intercept are also congruent.
      * Therefore, the arc intercepted by $\overline{CH}$ also measures (2*x - 27) degrees.
      * Applying the Intersecting Chords Theorem again, we get: *y* = (1/2) * ((2*x - 27)° + (2*x - 27)°)
      * *y* = (1/2) * (4*x - 54)
      * *y* = 2*x - 27
   * **Step 5:** Set the two expressions for *y* equal to each other and solve for *x*.
      * 28° + *x* = 2*x - 27
      * 55° = *x*

3. **Answer:**
   * The value of *x* is **55**.
   * To verify our answer, we can substitute *x* = 55 back into the original expressions for the arc measures and see if they are equal.
      * Arc intercepted by $\overline{KJ}$: (2 * 55 - 27)° = 83°
      * Arc intercepted by $\overline{CH}$: (2 * 55 - 27)° = 83°
      * Since both arcs measure 83 degrees, our answer is correct.

We are given the lengths of two sides of the triangle in terms of x:  QR = 4x and QS = 6x - 1. We are told that the triangle is equilateral, meaning all sides are equal. The problem asks us to find the length of side RS (which is also represented by 2x + 1).

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Set the expressions for QR and QS equal to each other.
      * **Explanation:** Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal. Therefore, the length of QR must be equal to the length of QS.
      * **Formula:** QR = QS
      * **Plugging in values:** 4x = 6x - 1
      * **Calculation:** 
         * Subtract 4x from both sides: 0 = 2x - 1
         * Add 1 to both sides: 1 = 2x
         * Divide both sides by 2: x = 1/2

   * **Step 2:** Substitute the value of x into the expression for RS.
      * **Explanation:** We have found the value of x, which allows us to calculate the length of RS.
      * **Formula:** RS = 2x + 1
      * **Plugging in values:** RS = 2(1/2) + 1
      * **Calculation:** RS = 1 + 1 = 2

3. **Answer:** The length of RS is 2. 

   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by substituting the value of x into the expressions for QR and QS. If the triangle is equilateral, all three sides should have the same length.
      * QR = 4x = 4(1/2) = 2
      * QS = 6x - 1 = 6(1/2) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2
      * Since QR = QS = RS = 2, our answer is correct.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify Corresponding Angles:**  Since lines l1 and l2 are parallel, the angle formed by the triangle and line l2 (76 degrees) is a corresponding angle to the angle formed by the triangle and line l1. Corresponding angles are equal.
   2. **Find the Missing Angle in the Triangle:** The triangle has a right angle (90 degrees) and a 30-degree angle. The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, the missing angle in the triangle is 180 - 90 - 30 = 60 degrees.
   3. **Calculate Angle 2:** Angle 2 is the difference between the corresponding angle (76 degrees) and the missing angle in the triangle (60 degrees). Therefore, angle 2 = 76 - 60 = 16 degrees.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with two chords intersecting inside the circle. One chord intersects the circle at two points, and the other chord intersects the circle at one point, making it a tangent line. The problem asks us to find the value of *x* given that the angle formed by the intersection of the two chords is 30 degrees, one of the angles formed by the chord and the tangent line is 3*x* degrees, and the other angle formed by the chord and the tangent line is (4*x* + 50) degrees.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, the inscribed angle is 30 degrees, and its intercepted arc is the arc formed by the chord that intersects the circle at two points. Therefore, the measure of this arc is 2 * 30 degrees = 60 degrees.

   2. **Apply the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem:** This theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent line and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. In this case, the angle formed by the tangent line and the chord is (4*x* + 50) degrees, and its intercepted arc is the same arc as in step 1, which has a measure of 60 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: (4*x* + 50) = 1/2 * 60.

   3. **Solve for x:**
      * Simplify the equation: 4*x* + 50 = 30
      * Subtract 50 from both sides: 4*x* = -20
      * Divide both sides by 4: x = -5

3. **Answer:**
   * The final answer is x = -5.
   * We can verify our answer by plugging it back into the original expressions for the angles. If we substitute x = -5 into (4*x* + 50) and 3*x*, we get 30 degrees and -15 degrees, respectively. Since the sum of these two angles should equal the measure of the intercepted arc (60 degrees), we can verify that our answer is correct.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the formula for the y-coordinate of the center of mass of a triangle.
      * The formula is:  y_cm = (1/3) * h, where h is the height of the triangle.
      * This formula is derived from the fact that the center of mass of a triangle lies at the intersection of its medians, and the y-coordinate of this intersection is one-third of the height.

   * **Step 2:**  Apply the formula to the given triangle.
      * We know that the height of the triangle is 'a'.
      * Plugging this value into the formula: y_cm = (1/3) * a

   * **Step 3:** Simplify the expression.
      * y_cm = (1/3) * a

3. **Answer:**
   * The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle is (1/3) * a.
   * We can verify this answer by considering the symmetry of the triangle. Since it is an isosceles right triangle, the center of mass must lie on the line of symmetry, which is the vertical line passing through the midpoint of the base.  Furthermore, the center of mass must be located at a distance of one-third of the height from the base, which is consistent with our calculated answer.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the repeating pattern.
      * The circuit consists of a repeating pattern of three resistors connected in parallel, followed by one resistor connected in series.
      * This pattern repeats infinitely.

   * **Step 2:**  Represent the equivalent resistance of the infinite chain.
      * Let 'R<sub>eq</sub>' represent the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain between points 'a' and 'b'.

   * **Step 3:**  Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel section.
      * The three resistors in parallel have a resistance of 'R' each.
      * The formula for equivalent resistance (R<sub>p</sub>) of resistors in parallel is:
          * 1/R<sub>p</sub> = 1/R<sub>1</sub> + 1/R<sub>2</sub> + 1/R<sub>3</sub> + ...
      * In this case:
          * 1/R<sub>p</sub> = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
          * R<sub>p</sub> = R/3
      * Since R = 1, R<sub>p</sub> = 1/3.

   * **Step 4:**  Consider the equivalent resistance of the entire chain.
      * The equivalent resistance of the entire chain (R<sub>eq</sub>) can be represented as the parallel section (R<sub>p</sub>) followed by a series resistor (R) and then the remaining infinite chain (R<sub>eq</sub>).
      * This can be written as:
          * R<sub>eq</sub> = R<sub>p</sub> + R + R<sub>eq</sub>

   * **Step 5:**  Solve for R<sub>eq</sub>.
      * Substitute the value of R<sub>p</sub> (1/3) and R (1) into the equation:
          * R<sub>eq</sub> = 1/3 + 1 + R<sub>eq</sub>
      * Subtract R<sub>eq</sub> from both sides:
          * 0 = 1/3 + 1
      * This equation is not possible, indicating that our assumption of a finite equivalent resistance for the infinite chain is incorrect.

   * **Step 6:**  Recognize the infinite nature of the problem.
      * The infinite chain of resistors will always have a non-zero resistance, even though the equivalent resistance of the repeating pattern seems to be zero.
      * This is because the chain continues infinitely, and the resistance of the remaining infinite chain will always be non-zero.

   * **Step 7:**  Apply a limiting approach.
      * To find the equivalent resistance, we can consider a finite section of the chain and then take the limit as the number of sections approaches infinity.
      * Let's consider a section of the chain with 'n' repeating patterns.
      * The equivalent resistance of this section (R<sub>n</sub>) can be calculated using the same formula as in Step 4:
          * R<sub>n</sub> = R<sub>p</sub> + R + R<sub>n-1</sub>
      * We can recursively apply this formula to express R<sub>n</sub> in terms of R<sub>p</sub> and R:
          * R<sub>n</sub> = R<sub>p</sub> + R + (R<sub>p</sub> + R + (R<sub>p</sub> + R + ... + R<sub>p</sub> + R))
      * As 'n' approaches infinity, the sum of the terms in the parentheses will also approach infinity.
      * However, the ratio of R<sub>n</sub> to R<sub>n-1</sub> will approach a constant value.

   * **Step 8:**  Calculate the limiting value.
      * The ratio R<sub>n</sub>/R<sub>n-1</sub> represents the factor by which the equivalent resistance increases with each additional repeating pattern.
      * From the formula in Step 7, we can see that:
          * R<sub>n</sub>/R<sub>n-1</sub> = (R<sub>p</sub> + R + R<sub>n-1</sub>) / R<sub>n-1</sub> = 1 + (R<sub>p</sub> + R) / R<sub>n-1</sub>
      * As 'n' approaches infinity, R<sub>n-1</sub> also approaches infinity, and the term (R<sub>p</sub> + R) / R<sub>n-1</sub> approaches zero.
      * Therefore, the limiting value of R<sub>n</sub>/R<sub>n-1</sub> is 1.
      * This means that the equivalent resistance of the infinite chain will increase by a",False,0,8.927232027053833,1527.0

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Find the measure of each interior angle of the hexagon.
      * **Explanation:**  A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles. To find the measure of each interior angle, we can use the formula:
         *  Interior angle = (n - 2) * 180 / n, where n is the number of sides of the polygon.
      * **Formula:** Interior angle = (n - 2) * 180 / n

      * **Answer:** Angle ABO measures 20 degrees.

   * **Step 3:** Determine the value of x.

      * We are also given the proportion IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, which suggests that we might be dealing with similar triangles.

   * **Step 2:** Determine if triangles JWX and JYZ are similar.
      * We are given that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ.
      * We can see that ∠WXJ and ∠YZJ are vertical angles, and vertical angles are congruent. Therefore, m∠WXJ = m∠YZJ = 130°.
      * By the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Similarity Theorem, if two sides of one triangle are proportional to two sides of another triangle and the included angles are congruent, then the triangles are similar.
      * Since IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ and m∠WXJ = m∠YZJ, we can conclude that ΔJWX ~ ΔJYZ.

   * **Step 3:** Find m∠JYZ.
      * Since ΔJWX ~ ΔJYZ, corresponding angles are congruent.
      * Therefore, m∠JYZ = m∠JWX = 130°.

   * **Step 4:** Find m∠YIZ.
      * We know that m∠WZG = 20° and m∠JYZ = 130°.
      * Since ∠WZG and ∠YIZ are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), their measures add up to 180°.
      * Therefore, m∠YIZ = 180° - m∠WZG = 180° - 20° = 160°.

3. **Answer:**
   * The final answer is m∠YIZ = 160°.
   * We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle JYZ is 180°. We know that m∠JYZ = 130° and m∠YIZ = 160°. Therefore, m∠JZY = 180° - 130° - 160° = -110°. This is not possible, as angles in a triangle cannot be negative. This indicates that there might be an error in our calculations. We need to re-examine our steps to find the mistake.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between the central angle and the intercepted arc.
      * The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * This means that $m∠ABC = m\widehat{A C} = x$.
   * **Step 2:**  Apply the relationship between the measures of a major arc and its corresponding minor arc.
      * The sum of the measures of a major arc and its corresponding minor arc is $360°$.
      * Therefore, $x + y = 360°$.
   * **Step 3:**  Use the given information to solve for $x$.
      * We are given that $m∠ABC = 70°$, and we know from Step 1 that $m∠ABC = x$.
      * Substitute $70°$ for $x$ in the equation from Step 2: $70° + y = 360°$.
      * Subtract $70°$ from both sides of the equation: $y = 290°$.
      * Since $x + y = 360°$, we can substitute $290°$ for $y$ and solve for $x$: $x + 290° = 360°$.
      * Subtract $290°$ from both sides of the equation: $x = 70°$.

3. **Answer:**
   * The measure of minor arc $\widehat{A C}$ is $x = 70°$.
   * We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the measures of the major arc and minor arc is $360°$. We found that $y = 290°$ and $x = 70°$, and $290° + 70° = 360°$, so our answer is correct.

If ∠ACE = 25.0, then the degree of ∠D is ()",50°,"1. **Problem:**  What is the measure of angle D (∠D) in the given diagram, where AB is the diameter of circle O, DB and DC are tangents to the circle at points B and C, and ∠ACE = 25 degrees?

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
      *  We know that ∠ACE = 25 degrees.
      *  Since DB and DC are tangents to the circle, we know that ∠DBO and ∠DCO are both right angles (90 degrees).
      *  We also know that ∠ABO and ∠ACO are both right angles because AB and AC are radii of the circle.

   * **Step 2: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**
      *  In triangle ABO, we have: ∠ABO + ∠BAO + ∠BOA = 180 degrees.
      *  Since ∠ABO = 90 degrees and ∠BOA = 1/2 * ∠BOC (angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference), we can substitute these values: 90 degrees + ∠BAO + 1/2 * ∠BOC = 180 degrees.
      *  Solving for ∠BAO, we get: ∠BAO = 90 degrees - 1/2 * ∠BOC.

   * **Step 3: Apply the angle sum property of triangles again.**
      *  In triangle ACO, we have: ∠ACO + ∠CAO + ∠COA = 180 degrees.
      *  Since ∠ACO = 90 degrees and ∠COA = 1/2 * ∠BOC, we can substitute these values: 90 degrees + ∠CAO + 1/2 * ∠BOC = 180 degrees.
      *  Solving for ∠CAO, we get: ∠CAO = 90 degrees - 1/2 * ∠BOC.

   * **Step 4: Use the fact that ∠ACE = ∠BAO + ∠CAO.**
      *  We know that ∠ACE = 25 degrees.
      *  Substituting the values we found for ∠BAO and ∠CAO: 25 degrees = (90 degrees - 1/2 * ∠BOC) + (90 degrees - 1/2 * ∠BOC).
      *  Simplifying the equation: 25 degrees = 180 degrees - ∠BOC.
      *  Solving for ∠BOC: ∠BOC = 155 degrees.

   * **Step 5: Apply the angle sum property of triangles one more time.**
      *  In triangle BDC, we have: ∠BDC + ∠DBC + ∠BCD = 180 degrees.
      *  Since ∠DBC = 90 degrees and ∠BCD = 90 degrees (tangents to the circle), we can substitute these values: ∠BDC + 90 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees.
      *  Solving for ∠BDC: ∠BDC = 0 degrees.

   * **Step 6: Use the fact that ∠D = ∠BDC + ∠BOC.**
      *  We know that ∠BDC = 0 degrees and ∠BOC = 155 degrees.
      *  Therefore, ∠D = 0 degrees + 155 degrees = 155 degrees.

3. **Answer:**
   * The measure of angle D (∠D) is 155 degrees.
   * We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle BDC equals 180 degrees. We know that ∠DBC = 90 degrees, ∠BCD = 90 degrees, and we calculated ∠BDC = 0 degrees. Therefore, 90 degrees + 90 degrees + 0 degrees = 180 degrees, confirming our answer.

1. **Problem:**  The image shows a circle with diameter AB, and points C and D on the circle. We are given that ∠ABD = 50°. The problem asks us to find the measure of ∠BCD.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify the inscribed angle:**  ∠BCD is an inscribed angle of the circle, with its endpoints on the circle and its vertex also on the circle.
   2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   3. **Identify the intercepted arc:** The intercepted arc for ∠BCD is arc BD.
   4. **Find the measure of arc BD:** Since AB is the diameter, arc AB is a semicircle, measuring 180°.  We know ∠ABD = 50°, and since ∠ABD intercepts arc AD, we can find the measure of arc AD: ∠ABD = (1/2) * arc AD, so arc AD = 2 * ∠ABD = 2 * 50° = 100°.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key angles:**
      * We know ∠ACG = 32°.
      * Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know ∠CGA = 90°.
      * In triangle ACG, the sum of angles is 180°. Therefore, ∠CAG = 180° - ∠ACG - ∠CGA = 180° - 32° - 90° = 58°.

   2. **Apply angle bisector property:**
      * CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB. This means ∠ACD = ∠BCD.
      * Since ∠CAG = 58°, we have ∠ACD = ∠BCD = (1/2) * ∠ACB = (1/2) * (180° - ∠CAG) = (1/2) * (180° - 58°) = 61°.

   3. **Find ∠BFC:**
      * In triangle BFC, we can use the angle sum property: ∠BFC + ∠BCF + ∠CBF = 180°.
      * We know ∠BCF = ∠BCD = 61°.
      * Since F is the intersection of angle bisectors, ∠CBF = (1/2) * ∠ABC.
      * To find ∠ABC, we can use the angle sum property in triangle ABC: ∠ABC + ∠BAC + ∠ACB = 180°.
      * We know ∠BAC = ∠CAG = 58° and ∠ACB = ∠ACD + ∠BCD = 61° + 61° = 122°.
      * Therefore, ∠ABC = 180° - ∠BAC - ∠ACB = 180° - 58° - 122° = 0°.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Find the measure of each interior angle of the regular pentagon:**
      * **Formula:**  Sum of interior angles of an n-sided polygon = (n-2) * 180 degrees
      * **Explanation:** This formula calculates the total sum of all interior angles of any polygon based on the number of sides (n).
      * **Applying the formula:** For a pentagon (n=5), the sum of interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.
      * **Calculation:** Since the pentagon is regular, all interior angles are equal. Therefore, each interior angle measures 540 degrees / 5 = 108 degrees.

   2. **Find the measure of angle AED:**
      * **Explanation:** Triangle AED is an isosceles triangle because AE and DE are radii of the circle. Therefore, angles AED and ADE are equal.
      * **Calculation:** The sum of angles in triangle AED is 180 degrees.  Since angle A is an interior angle of the pentagon, it measures 108 degrees. Therefore, angle AED = (180 - 108) / 2 = 36 degrees.

   3. **Find the measure of angle ADE:**

   5. **Rearrange the equation:** Rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation: x² + x - 110 = 0.
   6. **Factor the quadratic equation:** Factor the quadratic equation: (x + 11)(x - 10) = 0.
   7. **Solve for x:**  Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:
