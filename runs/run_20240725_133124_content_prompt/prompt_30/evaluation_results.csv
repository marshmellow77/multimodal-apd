The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that a bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.  In this case, we have:

$$\frac{JQ}{QN} = \frac{JL}{LN}$$

We know that $JL = 16.5$ and $LN = 9 + 16.5 = 25.5$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $QN$:

$$QN^2 = QK^2 + KN^2$$

Since $\overline{KQ}$ is an angle bisector, we know that $\angle KQJ = \angle KQL$.  Also, $\angle KQJ$ and $\angle KQL$ are both right angles, so $\triangle KQJ \cong \triangle KQL$ by Angle-Angle-Side.  Therefore, $QJ = QL$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $QL$:

$$QL^2 = QM^2 + ML^2$$

We know that $QM = 9$ and $ML = 25.5 - 9 = 16.5$.  Therefore,

$$QL^2 = 9^2 + 16.5^2 = 364.25$$

**2. Use the angle bisector theorem:**

* In triangle ABD, BE is the angle bisector of angle ABD. Therefore, by the angle bisector theorem, we have: AE/ED = AB/BD.
* In triangle BCD, CF is the angle bisector of angle BCD. Therefore, by the angle bisector theorem, we have: AF/FD = BC/BD.

**3. Use the fact that AB = BC:**

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, we know that AB = BC. Therefore, we can substitute AB for BC in the second equation:

AF/FD = AB/BD.

**4. Combine the equations:**

Now we have two equations:

* AE/ED = AB/BD
* AF/FD = AB/BD

Since both equations have AB/BD on the right side, we can set the left sides equal to each other:

AE/ED = AF/FD.

**5. Use the fact that AD = 4:**

We know that AD = 4. Therefore, we can write:

AE + ED = 4
AF + FD = 4

**6. Solve for EF:**

We can now use the equations from steps 4 and 5 to solve for EF.  Let's solve for AE and AF in terms of ED and FD:

* AE = (AB/BD) * ED
* AF = (AB/BD) * FD

Substituting these into the equations from step 5, we get:

* (AB/BD) * ED + ED = 4
* (AB/BD) * FD + FD = 4

Simplifying these equations, we get:

* ED * (AB/BD + 1) = 4
* FD * (AB/BD + 1) = 4

Since both equations have (AB/BD + 1) on the right side, we can set the left sides equal to each other:

ED * (AB/BD + 1) = FD * (AB/BD + 1)

Dividing both sides by (AB/BD + 1), we get:

ED = FD

Therefore, EF = ED + FD = 2 * ED = 2 * (AD/2) = **2**.

2. **Find the area of each strip:** The area of each strip is dA = x * dy.

3. **Express x in terms of y:** Since the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, the slope of the hypotenuse is -1.  Therefore, the equation of the hypotenuse is y = -x + a. Solving for x, we get x = a - y.

**1. Simplify the Circuit**

* **Focus on a single repeating unit:**  Notice that the circuit consists of repeating units.  Let's focus on one unit, starting from point 'a' and going to the next junction where the pattern repeats.

* **Combine resistors in series and parallel:** Within this unit, we have:
    * Two resistors in series (R + R = 2R)
    * This combination is in parallel with another resistor (R)
    * The result of this parallel combination is in series with another resistor (R)

**2. Calculate the Equivalent Resistance of the Unit**

* **Parallel combination:** The equivalent resistance of the two resistors in parallel (2R and R) is:
   1/R_parallel = 1/2R + 1/R = 3/2R
   R_parallel = 2R/3

* **Series combination:** The equivalent resistance of the entire unit is:
   R_unit = R_parallel + R = 2R/3 + R = 5R/3

**3. Consider the Infinite Chain**

* **The pattern repeats:**  The equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain is the same as the equivalent resistance of one unit, plus the resistance of the rest of the infinite chain.  This can be expressed as:
   R_total = R_unit + R_total

* **Solve for R_total:**
   R_total = 5R/3 + R_total

   R_total = -5R/3

* **The result is negative:** This negative result indicates that the resistance of the infinite chain is actually zero. This is because the current can flow through an infinite number of paths, effectively shorting out the circuit.

**4. Substitute R = 1**

* Since R = 1, the resistance between terminals a and b is:
   R_total = -5(1)/3 = -5/3

The resistance between terminals a and b is effectively zero due to the infinite nature of the circuit.

6. Similarly, since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we know that ∠ABE = ∠CBE.
7. Therefore, ∠CBE = (1/2)∠ABC = (1/2)(180° - ∠CAB - ∠ACB) = (1/2)(180° - 58° - ∠ACB) = 61° - (1/2)∠ACB.
8. Now, consider triangle BFC. We know that ∠BFC + ∠FBC + ∠FCB = 180°.
9. Substituting the values we found above, we get: ∠BFC + (61° - (1/2)∠CBG) + (61° - (1/2)∠ACB) = 180°.
10. Simplifying the equation, we get: ∠BFC = 58° + (1/2)∠CBG + (1/2)∠ACB.
11. Since ∠CBG + ∠ACB = 180° - ∠CAB = 180° - 58° = 122°, we can substitute this into the equation: ∠BFC = 58° + (1/2)(122°) = 119°.

Therefore, the measure of ∠BFC is **119°**.",True,1,4.576074123382568,811.0
955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"**Step 1: Find the measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon.**

The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with *n* sides is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees.  For a pentagon (n=5), the sum of the interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.  Since all angles in a regular pentagon are equal, each angle measures 540/5 = 108 degrees.

**Step 2: Find the measure of angle AED.**

Since triangle AED is isosceles (AE = AD), angles AED and ADE are equal.  Therefore, angle AED = angle ADE = 108 degrees.

**Step 3: Find the measure of angle ADE.**

Angle ADE is half of angle AED, so angle ADE = 108/2 = 54 degrees.

**Answer:** The measure of angle ADE is **54 degrees**.",False,0,2.73279070854187,512.0
304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"1. **Identify the angles:** The figure shows two angles: x degrees and 70 degrees.
2. **Recognize supplementary angles:** The two angles form a straight angle, which means they are supplementary angles. Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees.
3. **Set up an equation:**  x + 70 = 180
4. **Solve for x:** Subtract 70 from both sides: x = 110
5. **Find y:**  y = x² = 110² = 12100

**Therefore, the value of y is 12100.**",False,0,2.1731810569763184,447.0
