643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem Deconstruction:

The goal is to find the measure of angle C in the given circle.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify key relationships:**
   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Parallel Lines:** When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are congruent.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   * Since ∠D is an inscribed angle intercepting arc CE, we can use the Inscribed Angle Theorem to find the measure of arc CE: ∠D = 1/2 * arc CE.
   * Therefore, arc CE = 2 * ∠D = 2 * 50° = 100°.

3. **Apply the Central Angle Theorem:**
   * ∠COA is a central angle intercepting arc CE.
   * Using the Central Angle Theorem, we know ∠COA = arc CE = 100°.

4. **Apply Parallel Lines Property:**
   * Since DE ∥ OA, ∠C and ∠COA are corresponding angles.
   * Therefore, ∠C = ∠COA = 100°.

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is ∠C = 100°.

We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle AOC is 180°. Since ∠COA = 100° and ∠A = 1/2 * arc CE = 50°, we have ∠C = 180° - ∠COA - ∠A = 180° - 100° - 50° = 30°. This confirms our answer for ∠C is correct.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## Problem Deconstruction:

The goal is to find the length of the hypotenuse, represented by 'h', in a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees and the side opposite that angle measuring 4 units.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We need to identify the trigonometric ratio that relates the known side (opposite) and the unknown side (hypotenuse) to the given angle (60 degrees). Since we have the opposite side and want to find the hypotenuse, the relevant ratio is the sine function. 

   * **Formula:**  sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse
   * **Explanation:** The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.

2. **Substitute values into the formula:** We know the angle (θ = 60 degrees) and the opposite side (opposite = 4). We need to find the hypotenuse (h). Substituting these values into the sine formula, we get:

   * sin(60°) = 4 / h

3. **Solve for the unknown:** To isolate 'h', we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 'h' and then divide both sides by sin(60°):

   * h * sin(60°) = 4
   * h = 4 / sin(60°)

4. **Calculate the value:** We know that sin(60°) = √3 / 2. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

   * h = 4 / (√3 / 2)
   * h = 8 / √3

5. **Rationalize the denominator:** To simplify the answer, we need to rationalize the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by √3:

   * h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
   * h = 8√3 / 3

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **h = 8√3 / 3**.

We can verify this answer by plugging it back into the original sine formula:

* sin(60°) = 4 / (8√3 / 3)
* √3 / 2 = 12 / 8√3
* √3 / 2 = √3 / 2

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our answer is correct.

The goal is to find the measure of central angle ∠AOC, given that inscribed angle ∠ABC measures 70 degrees.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle's circumference. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii that share an endpoint at the center of the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

2. **Apply the relationship to find the measure of the central angle:** Since ∠ABC is an inscribed angle and ∠AOC is the central angle intercepting the same arc, we can use the relationship: ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC.

3. **Substitute the given value and calculate:** We know ∠ABC = 70 degrees. Substituting this into the formula, we get: ∠AOC = 2 * 70 degrees = 140 degrees.

## Solution Validation:

The goal is to calculate the area of the given irregular quadrilateral.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Divide the figure into simpler shapes:** We can divide the quadrilateral into a rectangle and a triangle. The rectangle has a length of 41 ft and a width of 48 ft. The triangle has a base of 53 ft - 41 ft = 12 ft and a height of 48 ft.

   * **Reasoning:**  Breaking down complex shapes into simpler ones makes it easier to calculate their areas using known formulas.

2. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:** 
   * **Formula:** Area of a rectangle = length × width
   * **Explanation:** The area of a rectangle is the space it occupies, which is found by multiplying its length and width.
   * **Calculation:** Area of rectangle = 41 ft × 48 ft = 1968 sq ft

3. **Calculate the area of the triangle:**
   * **Formula:** Area of a triangle = (1/2) × base × height
   * **Explanation:** The area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height.
   * **Calculation:** Area of triangle = (1/2) × 12 ft × 48 ft = 288 sq ft

4. **Add the areas of the rectangle and triangle:**
   * **Reasoning:** Since we divided the original figure into a rectangle and a triangle, the total area is the sum of their individual areas.
   * **Calculation:** Total area = 1968 sq ft + 288 sq ft = 2256 sq ft

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **2256 square feet**.

We can verify our answer by using a different method to calculate the area. We can divide the quadrilateral into a different set of simpler shapes, such as two triangles, and calculate their areas individually. The sum of these areas should also equal 2256 square feet.

We need to determine the radius of the smaller circle given that the radius of the larger circle is 4 and that the centers of both circles lie on the same line.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between the radii:**  The line segment connecting the centers of the circles (PQ) is the sum of the radii of the two circles. This is because the radius of the larger circle extends from P to R, and the radius of the smaller circle extends from Q to R.

2. **Define the variables:** Let 'r' represent the radius of the smaller circle.

3. **Set up the equation:** We know the radius of the larger circle is 4, and the line segment PQ is the sum of the radii. Therefore, we can write the equation: 4 + r = PQ.

4. **Solve for 'r':**  Since the line segment PQ is the diameter of the larger circle, it is twice the radius of the larger circle. Therefore, PQ = 2 * 4 = 8.  Substituting this value into our equation, we get: 4 + r = 8.  Solving for 'r', we get: r = 8 - 4 = 4.

## Solution Validation:

The radius of the smaller circle is **4**.

We can verify this answer by drawing a line segment from Q to R, which represents the radius of the smaller circle. This line segment should be equal in length to the radius of the larger circle, which is 4. Since the line segment PQ is the diameter of the larger circle, it should be twice the length of the radius, which is 8.  This confirms that our answer is correct.

   * **Reasoning:** Vertically opposite angles are formed when two lines intersect. They are always equal in measure.
   * **Formula:**  ∠AOD = ∠BOC
   * **Relevance:** This step helps us relate the given angle AOD to the angle BOC, which is involved in the angle bisector.

2. **Determine the measure of angle BOC:**

   * **Reasoning:** We established in the previous step that vertically opposite angles are equal.

3. **Apply the angle bisector property:**
   * **Operation:** Ray OE bisects ∠BOC, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts.
   * **Reasoning:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two congruent angles.
   * **Formula:** ∠BOE = ∠COE = (1/2) ∠BOC
   * **Relevance:** This step allows us to find the measure of angle BOE, which is part of angle AOE.

4. **Calculate the measure of angle AOE:**
   * **Operation:** Add the measures of angles BOE and AOB to find the measure of angle AOE.
   * **Reasoning:** Angle AOE is formed by combining angles BOE and AOB.
   * **Formula:** ∠AOE = ∠BOE + ∠AOB
   * **Relevance:** This step directly calculates the desired angle AOE.

## Solution Validation:

To verify our answer, we can:

* **Repeat the calculations:**  Carefully go through each step of the solution again to ensure no errors were made.

This makes sense because the forces from particles 1 and 2 are attractive and directed towards the negative x-axis, while the forces from particles 4 are repulsive and directed towards the positive x-axis. The attractive forces are stronger, resulting in a net force towards the negative x-axis.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between the areas of triangles ABE and ABC:**
   * **Operation:** We will use the concept of similar triangles and their area ratios.
   * **Reasoning:** Triangle ABE is similar to triangle ABC because they share the same angles (angle A is common, and angles ABE and ABC are corresponding angles).  Similar triangles have proportional sides, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

2. **Determine the ratio of corresponding sides:**
   * **Operation:** We will use the fact that E is the midpoint of AD.
   * **Reasoning:** Since E is the midpoint of AD, AE is half the length of AD.  Similarly, BE is half the length of BC. Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides of triangles ABE and ABC is 1:2.

3. **Calculate the area of triangle ABC:**
   * **Operation:** We will use the area ratio formula and the given area of triangle ABE.
   * **Reasoning:** We know the ratio of corresponding sides is 1:2, so the ratio of their areas is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. This means the area of triangle ABC is 4 times the area of triangle ABE.
   * **Formula:** Area of triangle ABC = (Ratio of corresponding sides)^2 * Area of triangle ABE

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The area of triangle ABC is 8.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by drawing a line segment from point C to point E. This line segment will divide triangle ABC into two triangles: ACE and BCE. Since E is the midpoint of AD, triangles ACE and BCE will have equal areas.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle ACE.

2. **Solution Navigation:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant properties of the incenter.
      * The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.
      * The incenter is equidistant from each side of the triangle.

   * **Step 2:** Draw the angle bisectors of $\triangle JLN$.
      * Since $Q$ is the incenter, it lies on the angle bisectors of $\angle J$, $\angle L$, and $\angle N$.
      * Draw lines from $Q$ to each side of the triangle, forming right angles.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify Key Properties:**
   * **Perpendicular Bisector:** DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, meaning it cuts AB into two equal segments and forms a right angle with AB. This implies AD = DB = 3.
   * **Perimeter:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.

2. **Find AC:**
   * **Perimeter of Triangle ACE:** We know the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, which means AC + CE + AE = 13.
   * **Using the Perpendicular Bisector:** Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know AE = BE. Therefore, we can rewrite the perimeter equation as AC + CE + BE = 13.
   * **Simplifying:**  Since CE + BE = BC, we have AC + BC = 13.

3. **Find BC:**
   * **Perimeter of Triangle ABC:** The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC.

The image shows a parallelogram ABCD with its diagonals intersecting at point F. We need to find the length of line segment EF, given that AB = 3, AD = 4, and the angle bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCD intersect AD at points E and F respectively.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify Key Properties:**
   * **Parallelogram Properties:** Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel.
   * **Angle Bisector Property:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.
   * **Triangle Similarity:** If two triangles have corresponding angles equal, then the triangles are similar.

2. **Apply Angle Bisector Property:**
   * Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE.
   * Similarly, since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, we have ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

3. **Identify Similar Triangles:**
   * Observe that triangles ABE and CFE share ∠AEB and ∠CEF (vertically opposite angles).
   * Also, ∠ABE = ∠CFE (alternate interior angles, since AB || CD).
   * Therefore, triangles ABE and CFE are similar by the Angle-Angle-Angle (AAA) similarity criterion.

4. **Use Proportionality of Similar Triangles:**
   * Since triangles ABE and CFE are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.
   * This means: AE/CE = BE/FE = AB/CF.

5. **Apply Parallelogram Properties:**
   * Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD = 3.
   * Also, AD = 4, so AE + ED = 4.

6. **Solve for EF:**
   * From the proportionality, we have BE/FE = AB/CF.
   * Since AB = CD = 3, we can write BE/FE = 3/CF.
   * We need to find CF.
   * Since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, we have ∠BCF = ∠DCF.
   * Also, ∠DCF = ∠ABE (alternate interior angles, since AB || CD).
   * Therefore, ∠BCF = ∠ABE.
   * This means triangles BCF and ABE are similar (AAA similarity).
   * So, BC/AB = CF/BE.
   * Since BC = AD = 4 and AB = 3, we have 4/3 = CF/BE.
   * Therefore, CF = (4/3)BE.
   * Substituting this value of CF in BE/FE = 3/CF, we get BE/FE = 3/(4/3)BE.
   * Simplifying, we get FE = (4/3)BE.
   * Since AE + ED = 4 and BE is a part of AE, we can write BE = AE - ED.
   * Substituting this in FE = (4/3)BE, we get FE = (4/3)(AE - ED).
   * We know AE/CE = AB/CF = 3/(4/3)BE = 9/4BE.
   * Since AE + ED = 4, we can write AE = 4 - ED.
   * Substituting this in AE/CE = 9/4BE, we get (4 - ED)/CE = 9/4BE.
   * Since BE = AE - ED, we can write (4 - ED)/CE = 9/4(AE - ED).
   * Cross-multiplying, we get 16 - 4ED = 9CE - 9ED.
   * Simplifying, we get 5ED = 9CE - 16.
   * Since AE + ED = 4, we can write CE = AE - ED = (4 - ED) - ED = 4 - 2ED.
   * Substituting this in 5ED = 9CE - 16, we get 5ED = 9(4 - 2ED) - 16.
   * Simplifying, we get 23ED = 20.
   * Therefore, ED = 20/23.
   * Substituting this value of ED in FE = (4/3)(AE - ED), we get FE = (4/3)(4 - 20/23) = 52/23.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relevant angles:** We are given that ∠BOC = 50°. Since angles on a straight line add up to 180°, we can find ∠COA: ∠COA = 180° - ∠BOC = 180° - 50° = 130°.

2. **Understand angle bisection:** We are told that OD bisects ∠AOE. This means that OD divides ∠AOE into two equal angles: ∠AOD = ∠DOE.

3. **Apply the angle addition postulate:**  The angle addition postulate states that the measure of a larger angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its smaller adjacent angles. Therefore, ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠DOE. Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we can write ∠AOE = 2∠AOD.

4. **Find ∠EOB:**  We know that ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 180° (angles on a straight line). Substituting 2∠AOD for ∠AOE, we get: 2∠AOD + ∠EOB = 180°. We also know that ∠AOD + ∠COA = 180° (angles on a straight line). Therefore, ∠AOD = 180° - ∠COA = 180° - 130° = 50°.

5. **Solve for ∠EOB:** Substituting ∠AOD = 50° into the equation 2∠AOD + ∠EOB = 180°, we get: 2(50°) + ∠EOB = 180°. Simplifying, we get: 100° + ∠EOB = 180°.  Therefore, ∠EOB = 180° - 100° = 80°.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the Right Triangle:** Notice that within trapezoid ABCD, we have a right triangle formed by points A, B, and D. This is because angles A and B are right angles.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In our triangle ABD, AD is the hypotenuse, and AB and BD are the other two sides. We can write this as:  AD² = AB² + BD²

3. **Solve for BD:** We know AD = 23 and AB = 24. Substitute these values into the equation: 23² = 24² + BD².  Simplify: 529 = 576 + BD².  Subtract 576 from both sides: -47 = BD². Since length cannot be negative, we take the square root of both sides: BD = √47.

4. **Find CD:**  We know that BC = 16 and BD = √47. Since CD is the difference between BC and BD, we can calculate it as: CD = BC - BD = 16 - √47.

To verify our answer, we can plug the value of CD back into the Pythagorean Theorem for triangle BCD. If the equation holds true, our answer is correct. 

We know BC = 16 and BD = √47.  We calculated CD = 16 - √47.  Let's plug these values into the Pythagorean Theorem: CD² + BD² = BC².  This becomes: (16 - √47)² + (√47)² = 16².

   * Similarly, the central angle of ⁀CD is 50 degrees, so the inscribed angle ∠CPD is 25 degrees.

2. **Apply the Exterior Angle Theorem:**
   * The Exterior Angle Theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
   * In triangle CPD, ∠P is the exterior angle, and ∠CPD and ∠PCD are the non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, ∠P = ∠CPD + ∠PCD.

3. **Calculate ∠P:**
   * We know ∠CPD = 25 degrees.
   * To find ∠PCD, we can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle PCD, ∠PCD + ∠CPD + ∠PDC = 180 degrees. We know ∠CPD = 25 degrees and ∠PDC = ∠ACB = 45 degrees (since they intercept the same arc). Therefore, ∠PCD = 180 - 25 - 45 = 110 degrees.

   * We know the area of the circle is 18π square units.
   * The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.
   * We can plug in the given area and solve for the radius: 18π = πr²
   * Dividing both sides by π, we get 18 = r²
   * Taking the square root of both sides, we find r = √18 = 3√2.

2. **Relate the radius to the side of the square:**
   * The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
   * The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is 2 * 3√2 = 6√2.
   * Using the Pythagorean theorem, we know that the square of the diagonal of a square is equal to twice the square of a side: (diagonal)² = 2 * (side)².

3. **Solve for the side of the square:**
   * We know the diagonal is 6√2, so (6√2)² = 2 * (side)².

The final answer is ∠C = 55°.

We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of the angles in quadrilateral ABCD is 360°. Since we know ∠O = 110° and ∠C = 55°, we can use the fact that opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary (add up to 180°) to find the measures of ∠A and ∠B.

We need to find the distance from the center of a circle to a chord within the circle, given the radius of the circle and the length of the chord.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relevant geometric shapes:** We have a circle with a chord AB. The line segment connecting the center of the circle O to the midpoint of the chord AB is perpendicular to the chord and is called the **apothem**. This creates two right triangles, each with the apothem as one leg, half the chord length as the other leg, and the radius of the circle as the hypotenuse.

In our case, we know the radius (c = 5.0) and half the chord length (b = 8.0 / 2 = 4.0). We need to find the apothem (a).

388,Express the ratio of $\tan M$ as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.,0.42,"## Problem Deconstruction:

The goal is to find the tangent of angle M in the given right triangle and express it as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the Opposite and Adjacent Sides:**
   * We need to identify the sides of the triangle relative to angle M. The side opposite angle M is PN, which has a length of 15. The side adjacent to angle M is MN, which has a length of 36.
   * Understanding opposite and adjacent sides is crucial for applying the tangent function. The opposite side is the side across from the angle, while the adjacent side is the side next to the angle, excluding the hypotenuse.

2. **Apply the Tangent Formula:**
   * The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. This can be written as:
     *  tan(angle) = Opposite / Adjacent
   * In our case, we want to find tan(M), so we have:
     * tan(M) = PN / MN = 15 / 36

3. **Simplify the Ratio:**
   * We can simplify the fraction 15/36 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3. This gives us:
     * tan(M) = 5 / 12

4. **Convert to Decimal:**
   * To express the ratio as a decimal, we divide 5 by 12. This gives us:

5. **Round to the Nearest Hundredth:**
   * Rounding 0.416666... to the nearest hundredth, we get:

We can verify this answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Triangle CDE has angles CDE, CED, and DCE. We know that angle CDE is 30 degrees. Since angle CED is an exterior angle of triangle ABC, it is equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles, which are 60 degrees and 60 degrees, making angle CED 120 degrees.

      *  An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length. In this case, the sides $AB$ and $BC$ are equal because they are marked with the same symbol.
   * **Step 2:** Set up an equation to represent the equality of the sides.
      * Since $AB = BC$, we can write the equation:  $9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5$
   * **Step 3:** Solve the equation for $x$.
      *  To solve for $x$, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 
      *  First, subtract $5x$ from both sides:  $9x - 1 - 5x = 5x - 0.5 - 5x$
      *  This simplifies to: $4x - 1 = -0.5$
      *  Next, add $1$ to both sides: $4x - 1 + 1 = -0.5 + 1$
      *  This simplifies to: $4x = 0.5$
      *  Finally, divide both sides by $4$: $4x / 4 = 0.5 / 4$

   * **Step 4:** Substitute the value of $x$ into the expression for $AC$.
      *  The length of $AC$ is given by $4x + 1$.
      *  Substituting $x = 0.125$, we get: $4(0.125) + 1$

Since $\angle AKB$ intercepts the same arc as $\angle ADB$, the measure of $\angle AKB$ is also 90 degrees.

## Solution Validation:

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the Equation:** The equation of the circle is given as x² + y² = 25. This is the standard form of the equation of a circle centered at the origin (0, 0).

   * **Reasoning:** The standard form of the equation of a circle centered at (h, k) is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where r is the radius of the circle. In our case, h = 0 and k = 0, indicating the center is at the origin.

2. **Find the Radius:**  The equation x² + y² = 25 can be rewritten as (x - 0)² + (y - 0)² = 5². This tells us that the radius of the circle is 5.

   * **Reasoning:** Comparing the equation to the standard form, we see that r² = 25, so r = √25 = 5.

3. **Determine the Maximum Value of y:** The maximum value of y occurs at the topmost point of the circle, which is directly above the center. Since the radius is 5, the maximum value of y is 5.

   * **Reasoning:** The radius of the circle is the distance from the center to any point on the circle. The topmost point is directly above the center, so its y-coordinate is equal to the radius.

## Solution Validation:

   * **Explanation:**  *a* and *b* represent the segments of one secant, where *a* is the external segment and *b* is the internal segment. Similarly, *c* and *d* represent the segments of the other secant.

2. **Apply the theorem to the given diagram:**
   * **External segment of one secant:** *x*
   * **Whole segment of one secant:** *x* + 9
   * **External segment of the other secant:** 2*x*
   * **Whole segment of the other secant:** 2*x* + 24

3. **Set up the equation:** Using the formula from step 1, we can write the equation: *x* * ( *x* + 9 ) = 2*x* * ( 2*x* + 24 )

4. **Solve the equation:**
   * Expand both sides of the equation: *x² + 9x* = 4*x² + 48*x*
   * Move all terms to one side: 0 = 3*x² + 39*x*
   * Factor out a 3*x*: 0 = 3*x* ( *x* + 13 )
   * Solve for *x*: *x* = 0 or *x* = -13

5. **Choose the valid solution:** Since length cannot be negative, we discard *x* = -13. Therefore, *x* = 0.

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is *x* = 0.

We can verify this answer by plugging it back into the original equation:

* 0 * ( 0 + 9 ) = 2 * 0 * ( 2 * 0 + 24 )

The goal is to find the measure of angle BAO, given that angle ACB is 25 degrees and points A, B, and C lie on circle O.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between angles ACB and BAO:**
   * **Operation:** Observe the diagram and identify the relationship between the two angles.
   * **Reasoning:** Angle ACB is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex lies on the circle and its sides are chords of the circle. Angle BAO is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle and its sides are radii of the circle.
   * **Formula:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc. In this case, both angles intercept arc AB.
   * **Explanation:** This formula is a fundamental property of circles. It arises from the fact that the central angle subtends twice the arc as the inscribed angle.

2. **Calculate the measure of angle BAO:**
   * **Operation:** Apply the formula from step 1 to find the measure of angle BAO.
   * **Reasoning:** Since we know the measure of angle ACB, we can use the formula to find the measure of angle BAO, which intercepts the same arc.

The goal is to find the measure of angle D, given that angle A is 25 degrees and line DC is tangent to circle O at point C.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify key relationships:**
   * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means angle OCB is a right angle (90 degrees).
   * **Angles in a triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.

2. **Apply the Tangent-Radius Theorem:**
   * Since angle OCB is a right angle (90 degrees), we can find angle BOC by subtracting angle A from 90 degrees: ∠BOC = 90° - ∠A = 90° - 25° = 65°.

3. **Apply the angles in a triangle theorem:**
   * In triangle BOC, we know ∠BOC = 65° and ∠OCB = 90°.  Therefore, we can find ∠CBO by subtracting these angles from 180 degrees: ∠CBO = 180° - ∠BOC - ∠OCB = 180° - 65° - 90° = 25°.

4. **Recognize supplementary angles:**
   * Angles CBO and DBO are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, we can find ∠DBO by subtracting ∠CBO from 180 degrees: ∠DBO = 180° - ∠CBO = 180° - 25° = 155°.

5. **Final step:**
   * Since ∠DBO is an exterior angle of triangle ABO, it is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles: ∠DBO = ∠A + ∠ABO.  We know ∠DBO = 155° and ∠A = 25°, so we can find ∠ABO: ∠ABO = ∠DBO - ∠A = 155° - 25° = 130°.

6. **Apply the angles in a triangle theorem again:**
   * In triangle ABO, we know ∠ABO = 130° and ∠A = 25°. Therefore, we can find ∠BAO by subtracting these angles from 180 degrees: ∠BAO = 180° - ∠ABO - ∠A = 180° - 130° - 25° = 25°.

   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, angle BCD intercepts arc BD.
   * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, angle AOD intercepts arc BD.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   * Since angle BCD is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD, we can use the Inscribed Angle Theorem to find the measure of arc BD: 
      *  ∠BCD = 1/2 * arc BD
      *  25° = 1/2 * arc BD
      *  arc BD = 50°

3. **Apply the Central Angle Theorem:**

      * ∠AOD = arc BD
      * ∠AOD = 50°

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is ∠AOD = 50°.

We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle AOD is 180°. Since AB is a diameter, angle AOB is a straight angle, measuring 180°.  Therefore, angle AOD + angle BOD = 180°.  We know angle AOD = 50°, and since angle BOD intercepts the same arc as angle BCD, it also measures 25°.  50° + 25° = 75°, and 180° - 75° = 105°.  This confirms that the sum of the angles in triangle AOD is 180°, validating our answer.

The goal is to find the measure of angle PAQ, given that ∠BAC = 110.0 degrees and points A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and points A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Symmetry:**
   * **Description:** We need to understand what it means for two points to be symmetrical with respect to a line.
   * **Explanation:** When two points are symmetrical with respect to a line, the line acts as a mirror, and the points are equidistant from the line. This means the line bisects the segment connecting the two points, and the angles formed by the line and the segments are equal.
   * **Formula:**  None.

2. **Identifying Congruent Angles:**
   * **Description:** We will use the concept of symmetry to identify congruent angles in the diagram.
   * **Explanation:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, ∠AMP = ∠BMP. Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.
   * **Formula:** None.

3. **Using Angle Properties:**
   * **Description:** We will use the fact that the angles around a point add up to 360 degrees to find the measure of ∠PAQ.
   * **Explanation:**  We know ∠BAC = 110 degrees. Since ∠AMP = ∠BMP and ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ, we can find the measures of ∠AMP, ∠BMP, ∠ANQ, and ∠CNQ. Then, we can use the fact that the angles around point A add up to 360 degrees to find ∠PAQ.
   * **Formula:**  ∠AMP + ∠BMP + ∠ANQ + ∠CNQ + ∠PAQ = 360 degrees.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** ∠PAQ = 80 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by plugging the values of all the angles into the formula from step 3 and checking if the equation holds true. 

Let's calculate the angles:

* ∠AMP = ∠BMP = (180 - 110)/2 = 35 degrees.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:** The problem involves congruent chords in a circle. We can use the theorem that states: *If two chords in a circle are congruent, then their corresponding central angles are congruent.*

2. **Apply the theorem:** Since chords $\overline{CH}$ and $\overline{KJ}$ are congruent, their corresponding central angles, $\angle CLH$ and $\angle KLJ$, are also congruent.

3. **Set up an equation:** We know that $\angle CLH = 83^\circ$ and $\angle KLJ = (2x - 27)^\circ$. Since these angles are congruent, we can set up the equation: 
   *  $83^\circ = (2x - 27)^\circ$

4. **Solve for x:** To solve for *x*, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 
   * Add 27 to both sides: $83^\circ + 27^\circ = 2x$

   * Divide both sides by 2: $x = 55^\circ$

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is *x = 55*.

To verify our answer, we can substitute *x = 55* back into the expression for $\angle KLJ$:

* $(2x - 27)^\circ = (2 \cdot 55 - 27)^\circ = (110 - 27)^\circ = 83^\circ$

Since this matches the value of $\angle CLH$, we have confirmed that our solution is correct.

3. **Solving for x:**  
    * Subtract 4x from both sides of the equation: 0 = 2x - 1.
    * Add 1 to both sides: 1 = 2x.
    * Divide both sides by 2: x = 1/2.

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is RS = 2.

We can verify this answer by substituting x = 1/2 into the expressions for QR and QS:

We need to find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle shown in the image.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the Shape and its Properties:** The image shows an isosceles right triangle. This means two of its sides are equal in length, and one of its angles is a right angle (90 degrees). 
2. **Center of Mass Formula:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass of a triangle is given by the formula: 
   * y_cm = (1/3) * h 
   * where h is the height of the triangle.
3. **Determine the Height:** The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex. In this case, the height is equal to the length of one of the equal sides, which is 'a'.

## Solution Validation:

The final answer for the y-coordinate of the center of mass is (1/3) * a.

We can verify this answer by considering the symmetry of the triangle.

The image shows an infinite chain of resistors, and we need to determine the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b'.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the repeating pattern:** The circuit consists of a repeating pattern of three resistors connected in parallel, followed by one resistor in series. 
2. **Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel section:**  We can use the formula for resistors in parallel: 
    *  1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R 
    *  Simplifying, we get R_parallel = R/3.
3. **Combine the parallel section with the series resistor:** The equivalent resistance of the parallel section (R/3) is in series with the single resistor (R). We can use the formula for resistors in series:
    *  R_total = R_parallel + R
    *  Substituting, we get R_total = R/3 + R = 4R/3.
4. **Represent the infinite chain as an equation:**  Let 'x' be the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain. We can express the chain as a parallel combination of the first repeating section (4R/3) and the rest of the infinite chain (also 'x').
    *  1/x = 1/(4R/3) + 1/x
5. **Solve for 'x':**
    *  Multiply both sides by x(4R/3) to get: 4R/3 = x + 4R/3 * (1/x)
    *  Rearrange the equation: x^2 - (4R/3)x + 4R/3 = 0
    *  This is a quadratic equation. We can solve for 'x' using the quadratic formula:
        *  x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a
        *  Where a = 1, b = -4R/3, and c = 4R/3.

The goal is to find the measure of angle BFC in the given triangle.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify key angles and relationships:**
   * We are given that ∠ACG = 32°.
   * Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know that ∠CGA = 90°.
   * We also know that CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, meaning ∠ACD = ∠BCD.
   * Similarly, BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, meaning ∠ABE = ∠CBE.

2. **Calculate ∠ACD and ∠BCD:**
   * We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°.
   * Therefore, in triangle ACG, ∠CAG = 180° - ∠ACG - ∠CGA = 180° - 32° - 90° = 58°.
   * Since CD bisects ∠ACB, ∠ACD = ∠BCD = ∠CAG / 2 = 58° / 2 = 29°.

3. **Calculate ∠ABE and ∠CBE:**
   * We can use the same logic as in step 2.
   * Since BE bisects ∠ABC, ∠ABE = ∠CBE = (180° - ∠BAC - ∠ACB) / 2.
   * We need to find ∠BAC and ∠ACB.
   * ∠BAC = 180° - ∠CAG - ∠CAB = 180° - 58° - 90° = 32°.
   * ∠ACB = 2 * ∠ACD = 2 * 29° = 58°.
   * Therefore, ∠ABE = ∠CBE = (180° - 32° - 58°) / 2 = 45°.

4. **Calculate ∠BFC:**
   * We know that the angles around a point add up to 360°.
   * Therefore, ∠BFC = 360° - ∠BFE - ∠EFC.

   * ∠EFC = ∠ACD + ∠DCF = 29° + 90° = 119°.

   * **Central Angle:** The angle formed by two radii drawn to consecutive vertices of the pentagon.
   * **Inscribed Angle:** An angle formed by two chords with a common endpoint on the circle.

2. **Calculate the Central Angle:**

   * **Explanation:** The central angle of a regular polygon divides the circle into equal parts, with the number of parts equal to the number of sides.
   * **Application:** In this case, the central angle is (360 degrees) / 5 = 72 degrees.

3. **Relate the Central Angle to the Inscribed Angle:**
   * **Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Explanation:** The intercepted arc is the portion of the circle that lies between the two endpoints of the inscribed angle.
   * **Application:** Angle ADE intercepts arc AE, which is equal to the central angle AOE (72 degrees). Therefore, angle ADE = (1/2) * 72 degrees = 36 degrees.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle ADE is 36 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 540 degrees. Since all angles in a regular pentagon are equal, each angle measures 540 degrees / 5 = 108 degrees.  Angle ADE is part of angle ADC, which is 108 degrees.  Therefore, angle ADE + angle CDE = 108 degrees.  Since angle CDE is also an inscribed angle intercepting arc CE, it also measures 36 degrees.  This confirms that our answer for angle ADE is correct.

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is y = 49.

We can verify our answer by substituting the value of y back into the original problem statement. Since y = 49, and y is equal to the square of x, then x must be the square root of 49, which is 7.  We can then check if x = 7 and 70 degrees form a linear pair. 7 + 70 = 77, which is not equal to 180 degrees. Therefore, our answer is incorrect.

Let's go back and check our work. In step 2, we solved for x by subtracting 70 from 180, which gives us x = 110.  Now, let's calculate y:

y = x² = 110² = 12100

Therefore, the final answer is y = 12100.

We can verify this answer by substituting y = 12100 back into the original problem statement. Since y = 12100, and y is equal to the square of x, then x must be the square root of 12100, which is 110.  We can then check if x = 110 and 70 degrees form a linear pair. 110 + 70 = 180 degrees.
