643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand the Properties**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Parallel Lines:** When parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.

**2. Apply the Properties**

* **Angle D:** Since CD is the diameter, ∠D intercepts a semicircle, which has a measure of 180°.  Therefore, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, ∠D = 1/2 * 180° = 90°.
* **Angle AOD:**  Since ∠D = 90°, and ∠D and ∠AOD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°), we have ∠AOD = 180° - 90° = 90°.
* **Angle EOA:**  Because DE || OA, ∠EOA and ∠D are corresponding angles and therefore equal. So, ∠EOA = 90°.
* **Angle COE:**  Since ∠EOA and ∠COE are supplementary angles, we have ∠COE = 180° - 90° = 90°.
* **Angle C:**  ∠C intercepts arc CE.  ∠COE is a central angle that intercepts the same arc.  Therefore, by the Central Angle Theorem, ∠C = 1/2 * ∠COE = 1/2 * 90° = 45°.

**3. Final Answer**

The degree of ∠C is **45°.**

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"The triangle is a right triangle, and we know one angle and one side. We can use the trigonometric function sine to find the length of the hypotenuse, $h$.

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is 4, and the hypotenuse is $h$.

Therefore, we can write:

```
sin(60°) = 4 / h
```

To solve for $h$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $h$ and then divide both sides by sin(60°):

```
h * sin(60°) = 4
h = 4 / sin(60°)
```

The sine of 60 degrees is √3/2. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

```
h = 4 / (√3/2)
```

To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 2/√3:

```
h = (4 * 2) / (√3 * 2)
h = 8 / √3
```

To rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:

```
h = (8 * √3) / (√3 * √3)
h = 8√3 / 3

Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse, $h$, is **8√3 / 3**.",False,0,4.317671060562134,642.0

The theorem that applies here is the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**, which states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

**Step 2: Apply the theorem to find the measure of arc AC.**

Since ∠ABC intercepts arc AC, we have:

∠ABC = 1/2 * arc AC

Substituting the given value of ∠ABC = 70.0°, we get:

70.0° = 1/2 * arc AC

Solving for arc AC, we get:

arc AC = 2 * 70.0° = 140.0°

**Step 3: Apply the theorem again to find the measure of ∠AOC.**

Since ∠AOC is a central angle that intercepts arc AC, we have:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant angles.**

* We are given that ∠AOD = 70°.
* We know that ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180°.
* We are also given that OE bisects ∠BOC, meaning it divides ∠BOC into two equal angles.

**Step 2: Calculate ∠BOD.**

Since ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles, we can use the following formula:

∠AOD + ∠BOD = 180°

Substituting the given value for ∠AOD, we get:

70° + ∠BOD = 180°

Solving for ∠BOD:

∠BOD = 180° - 70° = 110°

**Step 3: Calculate ∠BOC.**

Since ∠BOD and ∠BOC are supplementary angles, we can use the same formula as in Step 2:

∠BOD + ∠BOC = 180°

Substituting the value we calculated for ∠BOD, we get:

Solving for ∠BOC:

∠BOC = 180° - 110° = 70°

Since OE bisects ∠BOC, we know that:

∠BOE = ∠BOC / 2

Substituting the value we calculated for ∠BOC, we get:

To solve this, we need to consider the forces exerted by each of the other particles on particle 3 and then sum up their x-components.

**1. Forces due to each particle:**

* **Force due to particle 1:**
    * The force between particle 1 and particle 3 is attractive because they have opposite charges.
    * The force acts along the diagonal of the square, so we need to find its x-component.

We can use the sine function to find the measure of angle J. The sine function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse:

```
sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse

In this case, we have:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant triangles.**

We can see that triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at D. We also see that triangle ABD is a right triangle with right angle at D.

**Step 2: Use the Pythagorean theorem.**

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

* For triangle ABC:  AB² = AC² + BC²
* For triangle ABD: AB² = AD² + BD²

* **Tangents from a point:**  Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.
* **Tangent-radius property:** A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°.

Since CD bisects angle ACB, we have:

∠ACD = ∠BCD = ∠ACB / 2

We are given that ∠DBC = 54°. Since BD is perpendicular to CD, we have:

Therefore, in triangle BDC, we can find angle BCD:

∠BCD = 180° - ∠BDC - ∠DBC = 180° - 90° - 54° = 36°

Since ∠ACD = ∠BCD, we have:

∠ACB = 2 * ∠BCD = 2 * 36° = 72°

Therefore, in triangle ABD, we can find angle ABD:

∠ABD = 180° - ∠ADB - ∠A = 180° - 90° - ∠A = 90° - ∠A

**Step 3: Find the measure of angle A.**

In triangle ABC, we have:

∠A + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°

* **Median:** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
* **Midpoint:** The midpoint of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts.

**Step 2: Apply the property of medians.**

Since AD is the median of triangle ABC, it divides triangle ABC into two triangles with equal areas: triangle ABD and triangle ACD.

**Step 3: Apply the property of midpoints.**

Since E is the midpoint of AD, it divides AD into two equal parts: AE and ED.

Triangle ABE and triangle ABD share the same base AB. Since E is the midpoint of AD, the height of triangle ABE is half the height of triangle ABD. Therefore, the area of triangle ABE is half the area of triangle ABD.

**Step 5: Calculate the area of triangle ABD.**

We know the area of triangle ABE is 2. Since the area of triangle ABD is twice the area of triangle ABE, the area of triangle ABD is 2 * 2 = 4.

Since $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$, $KQ$ is the angle bisector of $\angle K$.  Therefore, $\angle KQJ = \angle KQL$.  Also, $\angle KQJ = \angle QJP$ and $\angle KQL = \angle QLP$ because the incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle.  Therefore, $\angle QJP = \angle QLP$.

Since $\angle QJP = \angle QLP$ and $\angle JQP = \angle LQP = 90^\circ$, triangles $JQP$ and $LQP$ are congruent by Angle-Angle-Side.  Therefore, $JQ = LQ$.

Since $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$, $NQ$ is the angle bisector of $\angle N$.  Therefore, $\angle QNM = \angle QNP$.  Also, $\angle QNM = \angle QML$ and $\angle QNP = \angle QPM$ because the incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle.  Therefore, $\angle QML = \angle QPM$.

An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. In this case, BE bisects ∠ABC and CF bisects ∠BCD.

**Step 2: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem.**

The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side proportionally to the other two sides.

* In triangle ABE, BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC. Therefore, AE/ED = AB/BD.

* Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal: ∠ABC = ∠ADC and ∠BCD = ∠BAD.

**Step 4: Solve for AE and DF.**

* From the Angle Bisector Theorem in triangle ABE, we have AE/ED = AB/BD = 3/4. Since AD = 4, we have AE = 3 and ED = 4 - 3 = 1.

We are given that ∠BOC = 50° and that OD bisects ∠AOE. This means that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.

**Step 3: Substitute the known values.**

Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.  Let's call this value x.  We can now rewrite the equation from Step 2 as:

Angles AOE and EOB form a straight angle, so their measures add up to 180 degrees:

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In this case, we have:

Since we don't know the length of AC, we can't directly solve for CD. However, we can use the fact that D is the midpoint of AB to find AC.

Since D is the midpoint of AB, we know that AD = BD = 5. Therefore, triangle ABD is an isosceles triangle, and AC is the perpendicular bisector of AB. This means that AC bisects AB and forms two congruent right triangles: ACD and BCD.

Since AC = BC (because ACD and BCD are congruent), we can substitute AC for BC in the second equation:

Now we have two equations with two unknowns (AC and CD). We can solve for CD by substituting the first equation into the second equation:

Substituting BD = 5 and AD = 5, we get:

We are given a triangle ABC with two angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. We know that angle A is 110 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle BOC.

**Step 2: Apply the angle bisector theorem**

The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.

In our case, OB bisects angle ABC, so we can write:

```
AB/BC = AO/CO
```

Similarly, OC bisects angle ACB, so we can write:

```
AC/BC = AO/BO
```

**Step 3: Use the angle sum property of triangles**

The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.

Applying this to triangle ABC, we get:

```
∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
```

**Step 4: Solve for the angles**

We know that ∠A = 110°. Let's denote ∠B as x and ∠C as y. Substituting these values into the angle sum property equation, we get:

```
110° + x + y = 180°
```

Solving for x + y, we get:

```
x + y = 70°
```

**Step 5: Find the measure of angle BOC**

Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, we know that:

```
∠ABO = ∠CBO = x/2

and

```
∠ACO = ∠BCO = y/2
```

Now, consider triangle BOC. The sum of its interior angles is 180 degrees:

```
∠BOC + ∠BCO + ∠CBO = 180°
```

Substituting the values we found, we get:

```
∠BOC + y/2 + x/2 = 180°
```

Simplifying, we get:

```
∠BOC = 180° - (x/2 + y/2)

Substituting x + y = 70°, we get:

∠BOC = 180° - (70°/2)

**Step 1:  Identify the repeating pattern**

Notice that the circuit consists of a repeating pattern of three resistors in series (R, R, R) connected in parallel with another set of three resistors in series (R, R, R).

**Step 2:  Simplify the repeating pattern**

* **Series combination:** The three resistors in series have a combined resistance of 3R.
* **Parallel combination:** The two sets of three resistors in series are connected in parallel. The equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel is given by:

   1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2

   In this case, R1 = 3R and R2 = 3R.  Therefore:

   R_total = (3R)/2

**Step 3:  Consider the infinite nature of the circuit**

The repeating pattern extends infinitely.  We can represent the entire circuit as a single equivalent resistance (R_eq) connected in parallel with the repeating pattern.

**Step 4:  Apply the concept of symmetry**

Due to the infinite nature of the circuit, the resistance between terminals a and b is the same as the resistance between any two adjacent nodes in the repeating pattern.  This means that the equivalent resistance (R_eq) is equal to the resistance of the repeating pattern.

**Step 5:  Set up an equation**

We can express this relationship as:

Solving for R_eq, we get:

* For a pentagon (n=5), the sum of the interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.
* Since the pentagon is regular, all its interior angles are equal. Therefore, each interior angle measures 540 degrees / 5 = 108 degrees.

* Triangle AEO is isosceles because AO = OE (radii of the circle).
* Therefore, angles AEO and EAO are equal.
