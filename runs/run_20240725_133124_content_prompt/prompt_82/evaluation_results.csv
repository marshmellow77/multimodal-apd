**1. Understand the Forces**

* **Force from particle 1 on particle 3:** This force will be attractive (opposite charges) and will have a horizontal component to the left.
* **Force from particle 2 on particle 3:** This force will be repulsive (same charges) and will have a horizontal component to the right.
* **Force from particle 4 on particle 3:** This force will be attractive (opposite charges) and will be purely vertical (no horizontal component).

**2. Calculate the Individual Forces**

* **Coulomb's Law:** The force between two point charges is given by:
   
   ```
   F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2 
   ```
   where:
    * k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2)
    * q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges
    * r is the distance between the charges

* **Force from particle 1 on particle 3:**

   *  F23 = 0.1798 N

**3. Find the Horizontal Components**

* **Force from particle 1 on particle 3 (horizontal component):**
   *  F13x = F13 * cos(45°) = 0.7192 N * cos(45°) = 0.5096 N (to the left)

**Explanation:**

Since PA and PB are tangents to circle O, we know that OA is perpendicular to PA and OB is perpendicular to PB. Therefore, ∠OAP = ∠OBP = 90°.

Now, consider quadrilateral OACD. We have ∠OAP = ∠OCD = 90°, and ∠OAD = ∠OCD = 90°. Therefore, quadrilateral OACD is a rectangle.

Similarly, quadrilateral OBCD is also a rectangle.

Since OA = OB (radii of the same circle), we have AC = BD.

Therefore, the perimeter of △PCD is:

PC + CD + PD = (PA - AC) + CD + (PB - BD) = PA + PB - (AC + BD) = PA + PB - 2AC = 8 + 8 - 2(8/2) = 16.

* 因为CD平分∠ACB，所以∠ACD = ∠BCD。
* 因为BD⊥CD，所以∠BDC = 90°。

**2. 利用三角形内角和:**

* 在△BCD中，∠BCD + ∠BDC + ∠DBC = 180°，所以∠BCD = 180° - 90° - 54° = 36°。
* 因为∠ACD = ∠BCD，所以∠ACD = 36°。
* 在△ACD中，∠ACD + ∠CAD + ∠CDA = 180°，所以∠CDA = 180° - 36° - ∠CAD。

**3. 利用等角关系:**

* 因为∠A = ∠ABD，所以∠ABD = ∠CAD。
* 在△ABD中，∠ABD + ∠BAD + ∠BDA = 180°，所以∠BDA = 180° - ∠ABD - ∠BAD = 180° - ∠CAD - ∠BAD。

**4. 联立方程求解:**

* 现在我们有两个关于∠CDA和∠BDA的表达式：
    * ∠CDA = 180° - 36° - ∠CAD
    * ∠BDA = 180° - ∠CAD - ∠BAD
* 因为∠CDA + ∠BDA = 180°，所以：
    * (180° - 36° - ∠CAD) + (180° - ∠CAD - ∠BAD) = 180°
    * 324° - 2∠CAD - ∠BAD = 180°
    * 2∠CAD + ∠BAD = 144°
* 因为∠A = ∠ABD = ∠CAD，所以：
    * 2∠A + ∠A = 144°
    * 3∠A = 144°

Simplifying, we get $x^2 = 0$, so $x = 0$.  This is impossible, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

The mistake is that we assumed that $KJ = 16.5 - x$.  This is not true, because $\overline{JQ}$ is not necessarily perpendicular to $\overline{JK}$.  Instead, we need to use the fact that $\overline{JQ}$ bisects $\angle J$.

因为 N 是 BC 的中点，所以 BN = BC/2。

**3. 联立方程:**

将 BN = BC/2 代入上面的式子，得到：

If ∠CC′B′ = 32.0, then the size of ∠AC′B′ is ()",13°,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding the Rotation**

* Rotating △ABC 90 degrees clockwise around point A means that:
    * ∠BAC becomes ∠B′AC′ (both are right angles).
    * ∠ABC becomes ∠AB′C′ (they are congruent).
    * ∠ACB becomes ∠AC′B′ (they are congruent).

**Using the Properties of Rotations and Triangles**

1. **Angles in a Triangle:** The angles in any triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, in △AB′C′, we have:
   ∠AB′C′ + ∠AC′B′ + ∠B′AC′ = 180°

3. **Angle Relationships:**  Notice that ∠CC′B′ and ∠AB′C′ are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees) because they form a straight line.

**Solving for ∠AC′B′**

* We are given ∠CC′B′ = 32°.
* Since ∠CC′B′ and ∠AB′C′ are supplementary, ∠AB′C′ = 180° - 32° = 148°.
* Now, using the fact that the angles in △AB′C′ add up to 180°, we have:

* Solving for ∠AC′B′, we get:
   ∠AC′B′ = 180° - 148° - 90° = **-58°**

**Important Note:**  Angles are typically measured between 0° and 360°.  Since we got a negative angle, we need to add 360° to find the equivalent positive angle:

**Explanation:**

Since A, B, and C are points on circle O, we know that ∠ACB is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, the measure of arc AB is 2 * ∠ACB = 2 * 25.0 = 50.0 degrees.

∠BAO is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠ACB. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, ∠BAO = 50.0 degrees.

However, the question asks for the degree of ∠BAO, not the measure of arc AB. Since ∠BAO is a central angle, it is also the measure of the arc it intercepts. Therefore, the degree of ∠BAO is 50.0 degrees.

**Explanation:**

Let's analyze the problem step by step.

2. **Key Insight:** The key to minimizing the perimeter of triangle AMN is to make AM and AN as short as possible. This is achieved when AM and AN are perpendicular to BC and CD respectively.

3. **Geometric Construction:** Draw perpendiculars from A to BC and CD, intersecting them at points M and N respectively.

4. **Angle Analysis:** Now, consider triangle AMB. Since AM is perpendicular to BC, angle AMB is 90 degrees. We are given that angle B is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle BAM is 180 - 90 - 90 = 0 degrees. This means that AM coincides with AB.

Similarly, in triangle AND, angle AND is 90 degrees, angle D is 90 degrees, and angle NAD is 180 - 90 - 90 = 0 degrees. This means that AN coincides with AD.

5. **Calculating the Angles:** Since AM coincides with AB and AN coincides with AD, we have:

- Angle AMN = angle ABM = 90 degrees (since AB is perpendicular to BC)
- Angle ANM = angle ADN = 90 degrees (since AD is perpendicular to CD)

Therefore, angle AMN + angle ANM = 90 + 90 = 180 degrees.

* We are given that  IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. This means that triangle JXY is similar to triangle JIH.
* We know that m∠WXJ = 130° and m∠WZG = 20°.

**2. Find Missing Angles**

* **∠XJY:** Since ∠WXJ and ∠XJY are supplementary angles, m∠XJY = 180° - 130° = 50°.
* **∠YIZ:** Since ∠YIZ and ∠WZG are vertical angles, m∠YIZ = m∠WZG = 20°.

**3. Use Similar Triangles**

* **∠HIJ:** Because triangles JXY and JIH are similar, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, m∠HIJ = m∠XJY = 50°.

**4. Find ∠YIZ**

* **∠YIH:** The angles inside triangle IYH add up to 180°.  Therefore, m∠YIH = 180° - m∠HIJ - m∠YIZ = 180° - 50° - 20° = 110°.

737,Find the perimeter of the parallelogram.,78,"Here's how to find the perimeter of the parallelogram:

**Understanding Parallelograms**

* **Opposite sides are equal:**  The top and bottom sides of the parallelogram are equal in length.
* **Perimeter:** The perimeter is the total distance around the shape.

**Steps**

1. **Identify the sides:** We know one side is 23 ft.  Since opposite sides are equal, the other side is also 23 ft.

2. **Find the missing side:** We need to find the length of the top and bottom sides.  Notice that the dashed line creates a right triangle.  We can use trigonometry (specifically, the sine function) to find the missing side:

   * sin(60°) = opposite side / hypotenuse
   * sin(60°) = opposite side / 23 ft
   * opposite side = sin(60°) * 23 ft ≈ 19.9 ft

3. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   * Perimeter = 23 ft + 23 ft + 19.9 ft + 19.9 ft = 85.8 ft

**Answer:** The perimeter of the parallelogram is approximately 85.8 feet.

930,如图，F是△ABC的角平分线CD和BE的交点，CG⊥AB于点G．若∠ACG＝32°，则∠BFC的度数是（）,119°,"**解题思路：**

1. 利用角平分线的性质，求出∠BCF和∠BFC。
2. 利用三角形内角和定理，求出∠BFC的度数。

**解题步骤：**

1. 因为CF是∠ACB的角平分线，所以∠BCF = ∠ACF。
2. 因为CG⊥AB，所以∠ACG + ∠GCB = 90°。
3. 因为∠ACG = 32°，所以∠GCB = 90° - 32° = 58°。
4. 因为∠BCF = ∠ACF，所以∠BCF = 1/2 * ∠ACB = 1/2 * (∠ACG + ∠GCB) = 1/2 * (32° + 58°) = 45°。
5. 因为∠BFC + ∠BCF + ∠CBF = 180°，所以∠BFC = 180° - ∠BCF - ∠CBF = 180° - 45° - ∠CBF。
6. 因为BF是∠ABC的角平分线，所以∠CBF = 1/2 * ∠ABC。
7. 因为∠ABC + ∠ACB + ∠BAC = 180°，所以∠ABC = 180° - ∠ACB - ∠BAC = 180° - (∠ACG + ∠GCB) - ∠BAC = 180° - (32° + 58°) - ∠BAC = 90° - ∠BAC。
8. 所以∠CBF = 1/2 * ∠ABC = 1/2 * (90° - ∠BAC) = 45° - 1/2 * ∠BAC。
9. 所以∠BFC = 180° - ∠BCF - ∠CBF = 180° - 45° - (45° - 1/2 * ∠BAC) = 90° + 1/2 * ∠BAC。
