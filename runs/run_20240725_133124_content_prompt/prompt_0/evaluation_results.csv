643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand the Properties**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Parallel Lines:** When parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.

**2. Apply the Properties**

* **Angle D:** Since CD is the diameter, ∠D intercepts a semicircle. Therefore, ∠D is a right angle, and its measure is 90°.
* **Angle AOD:**  ∠D and ∠AOD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°). So, ∠AOD = 180° - 90° = 90°.
* **Angle AOE:** Since DE || OA, ∠AOE and ∠DEO are corresponding angles and are equal. Therefore, ∠AOE = ∠DEO = 50°.
* **Angle AOC:** ∠AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠AOD. Therefore, ∠AOC = ∠AOD = 90°.
* **Angle C:**  ∠C is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠AOC. Therefore, ∠C = 1/2 * ∠AOC = 1/2 * 90° = 45°.

4. **Find the length of AD:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem again, this time for triangle ABD.

    * AD² = AB² - BD²
    * We know AB = 4 units. To find BD, we need to consider triangle BCD.

5. **Find the length of BD:** Triangle BCD is also a right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again:

We are given that:

* D is a point inside triangle ABC.
* CD bisects angle ACB (meaning angle ACD = angle BCD).
* BD is perpendicular to CD (meaning angle BDC = 90 degrees).
* Angle A = angle ABD.
* Angle DBC = 54 degrees.

**Step 2: Find angle BCD.**

Since CD bisects angle ACB, we have:

angle ACD = angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB

**Step 3: Find angle BDC.**

We are given that BD is perpendicular to CD, so angle BDC = 90 degrees.

**Step 4: Find angle CBD.**

In triangle BCD, we can use the angle sum property:

angle BCD + angle CBD + angle BDC = 180 degrees

Substituting the known values:

angle BCD + angle CBD + 90 degrees = 180 degrees

angle BCD + angle CBD = 90 degrees

Since angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB, we can rewrite the equation as:

(1/2) * angle ACB + angle CBD = 90 degrees

**Step 5: Find angle ACB.**

We know that angle DBC = 54 degrees.  Since angle CBD and angle DBC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees), we have:

angle CBD = 180 degrees - angle DBC = 180 degrees - 54 degrees = 126 degrees

Substituting this value into the equation from Step 4:

(1/2) * angle ACB + 126 degrees = 90 degrees

(1/2) * angle ACB = -36 degrees

angle ACB = -72 degrees

**Step 6: Find angle A.**

In triangle ABC, we can use the angle sum property:

angle A + angle ACB + angle ABC = 180 degrees

Substituting the known values:

angle A - 72 degrees + angle ABC = 180 degrees

angle A + angle ABC = 252 degrees

Since angle A = angle ABD, we can rewrite the equation as:

angle ABD + angle ABC = 252 degrees

**Step 7: Find angle ABD.**

In triangle ABD, we can use the angle sum property:

angle ABD + angle BAD + angle ADB = 180 degrees

Since angle BAD = angle A and angle ADB = 90 degrees (because BD is perpendicular to CD), we have:

angle ABD + angle A + 90 degrees = 180 degrees

angle ABD + angle A = 90 degrees

**Step 8: Solve for angle A.**

We now have two equations:

angle ABD + angle ABC = 252 degrees

angle ABD + angle A = 90 degrees

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

angle ABC - angle A = 162 degrees

Since angle A = angle ABD, we can rewrite the equation as:

angle ABC - angle ABD = 162 degrees

angle ABC = angle ABD + 162 degrees

Substituting this value into the equation angle ABD + angle ABC = 252 degrees, we get:

angle ABD + (angle ABD + 162 degrees) = 252 degrees

angle ABD = 45 degrees

Since angle A = angle ABD, we have:

   - A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
   - The midpoint of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts.

   - Since E is the midpoint of AD, we know that AE = ED.
   - Also, since AD is a median, BD = DC.

The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that a bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.  In this case, we have:

$$\frac{JQ}{QN} = \frac{JL}{LN}$$

We know that $JL = 16.5$ and $LN = 9 + 16.5 = 25.5$.  We also know that $QN = QK + KN$.  Since $\overline{KQ}$ and $\overline{KN}$ are both radii of the incircle of $\triangle JLN$, we know that $QK = KN$.  Therefore, $QN = 2QK$.

Substituting these values into the Angle Bisector Theorem, we get:

$$\frac{JQ}{2QK} = \frac{16.5}{25.5}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\frac{JQ}{QK} = \frac{11}{17}$$

Since $JQ = QK + JK$, we can substitute to get:

$$\frac{QK + JK}{QK} = \frac{11}{17}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$1 + \frac{JK}{QK} = \frac{11}{17}$$

$$\frac{JK}{QK} = \frac{11}{17} - 1 = -\frac{6}{17}$$

Since lengths cannot be negative, we know that we made an error somewhere.  Looking back at our work, we see that we made a mistake when we assumed that $QN = 2QK$.  This is not necessarily true, since $\overline{QN}$ is not necessarily a diameter of the incircle.

Instead, we can use the fact that the incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle.  This means that $QK = QM = QP$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $QP$:

$$QP = \sqrt{JQ^2 - JP^2} = \sqrt{JQ^2 - 16.5^2}$$

We can also use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $QM$:

$$QM = \sqrt{QN^2 - MN^2} = \sqrt{QN^2 - 9^2}$$

Since $QP = QM$, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:

$$\sqrt{JQ^2 - 16.5^2} = \sqrt{QN^2 - 9^2}$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$JQ^2 - 16.5^2 = QN^2 - 9^2$$

We can use the Angle Bisector Theorem to express $QN$ in terms of $JQ$:

$$\frac{JQ}{QN} = \frac{JL}{LN} = \frac{16.5}{25.5} = \frac{11}{17}$$

$$QN = \frac{17}{11} JQ$$

**Step 1: Find the measure of angle FBE.**

Since BE bisects angle FBD, we know that angle FBE is half the measure of angle FBD.  We don't know the measure of angle FBD, but we can use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle FBD + angle BDC = 180 degrees.  We also know that angle BEC is 35 degrees.  Since angles BEC and BDC are supplementary (they add up to 180 degrees), we can find the measure of angle BDC:

Angle BDC = 180 degrees - angle BEC = 180 degrees - 35 degrees = 145 degrees.

Now we can find the measure of angle FBD:

Angle FBD = 180 degrees - angle BDC = 180 degrees - 145 degrees = 35 degrees.

Finally, we can find the measure of angle FBE:

Angle FBE = angle FBD / 2 = 35 degrees / 2 = 17.5 degrees.

Since CE bisects angle ACD, we know that angle BCE is half the measure of angle ACD.  We don't know the measure of angle ACD, but we can use the fact that angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.  Therefore, angle ACD + angle ACB + angle BCD = 360 degrees.  We know that angle BEC is 35 degrees and angle BCD is 145 degrees (from Step 1).  Therefore, we can find the measure of angle ACB:

Angle ACB = 360 degrees - angle ACD - angle BCD = 360 degrees - angle ACD - 145 degrees.

We also know that angle ACB + angle BCE + angle ACE = 180 degrees.  Substituting the value of angle ACB, we get:

360 degrees - angle ACD - 145 degrees + angle BCE + angle ACE = 180 degrees.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Angle BCE + angle ACE = angle ACD - 75 degrees.

Since CE bisects angle ACD, we know that angle BCE = angle ACE.  Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

2 * angle BCE = angle ACD - 75 degrees.

Solving for angle BCE, we get:

Angle BCE = (angle ACD - 75 degrees) / 2.

**Step 3: Find the measure of angle FAE.**

We know that angle FAE + angle EAB + angle BAE = 180 degrees.  We also know that angle EAB = angle FBE (from Step 1) and angle BAE = angle BCE (from Step 2).  Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

Angle FAE + angle FBE + angle BCE = 180 degrees.

Substituting the values of angle FBE and angle BCE, we get:

Angle FAE + 17.5 degrees + (angle ACD - 75 degrees) / 2 = 180 degrees.

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Understanding the Properties of a Rhombus:**
   - All sides of a rhombus are equal. Therefore, AB = BC = CD = DA = 5.
   - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. This means that AO = OC and BO = OD, and angles AOB, BOC, COD, and DOA are all right angles.

   - The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
   - Applying this to triangle ABD, we see that EF is parallel to BD and EF = 1/2 BD.

3. **Finding BD:**
   - Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BD.
   - In right triangle AOB, we have AO = AC/2 = 6/2 = 3 and AB = 5.
   - Applying the Pythagorean theorem:  BO² = AB² - AO² = 5² - 3² = 16.

**Understanding the Triangle Inequality Theorem**

The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.

**Applying the Theorem**

* **Case 1:**  If the third side is the smallest, it must be greater than the difference of the other two sides: 12 - 7 = 5.
* **Case 2:** If the third side is the largest, it must be less than the sum of the other two sides: 12 + 7 = 19.

**Finding the Impossible Perimeter**

* The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides.
* Since the third side must be greater than 5 and less than 19, the perimeter must be greater than 12 + 7 + 5 = 24 and less than 12 + 7 + 19 = 38.

Therefore, any perimeter outside the range of 24 to 38 cannot be the perimeter of the triangle.

3,△ABC的两内角平分线OB、OC相交于点O，若∠A＝110°，则∠BOC＝（）,145°,"**Step 1: Understand the problem**

We are given a triangle ABC with two internal angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. We know that angle A is 110 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle BOC.

**Step 2: Apply the angle bisector theorem**

The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.

In our case, OB bisects angle ABC, so we can write:

```
AB/BC = AO/CO
```

Similarly, OC bisects angle ACB, so we can write:

```
AC/BC = AO/BO
```

**Step 3: Use the angle sum property of triangles**

The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.

Applying this to triangle ABC, we get:

```
∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
```

**Step 4: Solve for the angles**

We know that ∠A = 110°. Let's denote ∠B as x and ∠C as y. Substituting these values into the angle sum property equation, we get:

```
110° + x + y = 180°
```

Solving for x + y, we get:

```
x + y = 70°
```

**Step 5: Find the measure of angle BOC**

Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, we know that:

```
∠ABO = ∠CBO = x/2
```

and

```
∠ACO = ∠BCO = y/2
```

Now, consider triangle BOC. The sum of its angles is:

```
∠BOC + ∠BCO + ∠CBO = 180°
```

Substituting the values we found, we get:

```
∠BOC + y/2 + x/2 = 180°
```

Simplifying, we get:

```
∠BOC = 180° - (x/2 + y/2)
```

```
∠BOC = 180° - (x + y)/2
```

We know that x + y = 70°, so:

```
∠BOC = 180° - 70°/2

```
∠BOC = 180° - 35°

Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle A:

∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
∠A + 58° + 90° = 180°
∠A = 180° - 58° - 90°

**Step 2: Find angle 2**

Angle 2 is an alternate interior angle to angle A. Since lines a and b are parallel, alternate interior angles are equal. Therefore:

∠2 = ∠A = 32°

Angle 1 is a corresponding angle to angle B. Since lines a and b are parallel, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore:

∠1 = ∠B = 58°

**Step 1: Analyze the problem**

We need to find the point M on BC and N on CD that minimizes the perimeter of △AMN. This is a classic optimization problem.

**Step 2: Apply the concept of reflection**

Reflect point A across line BC to get point A'. Similarly, reflect point A across line CD to get point A''.

**Step 3: Understand the relationship between the reflections and the perimeter**

* AM + MB = A'M
* AN + ND = A''N

Therefore, the perimeter of △AMN is:

AM + AN + MN = A'M + A''N + MN

**Step 4: Minimize the perimeter**

The perimeter of △AMN is minimized when A'M + A''N + MN is minimized. This occurs when A', M, and A'' are collinear.

**Step 5: Calculate the angles**

Since A'M and A''N are reflections of AM and AN, respectively, we have:

∠A'MB = ∠AMB
∠A''ND = ∠AND

Therefore, ∠AMN + ∠ANM = ∠A'MB + ∠A''ND = ∠A'MA''

**Step 6: Determine ∠A'MA''**

∠A'MA'' is the angle formed by the intersection of the lines A'A'' and BC. Since A'A'' is the reflection of AA across BC, ∠A'MA'' is twice the angle between AA and BC.

∠BAD = 120°, and ∠ABC = ∠ADC = 90°, so the angle between AA and BC is 180° - 120° - 90° = -30°.

Therefore, ∠A'MA'' = 2 * (-30°) = -60°.

2. **Using Angle Properties:** Since △ABC≌△DEF, we know that ∠A = ∠D = 22°.

3. **Angle Bisector:** CD bisects ∠BCA, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts. Therefore, ∠BCD = ∠ACD.

Symmetry means that two points are equidistant from a line of reflection. In this case, A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, meaning that line MP is the perpendicular bisector of line AB. Similarly, line NQ is the perpendicular bisector of line AC.

* We are given that ∠ACE = 25°.
* We know that DB and DC are tangents to the circle, meaning they form right angles with the radius at the points of tangency (∠OBC = ∠OCD = 90°).
* We also know that AB is a diameter, so ∠ACB is a right angle (∠ACB = 90°).

**Step 2: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**

* In triangle ACE, we have: ∠ACE + ∠CAE + ∠AEC = 180°
* We know ∠ACE = 25°, and since ∠AEC is an exterior angle to triangle ABC, we can use the exterior angle theorem: ∠AEC = ∠ABC + ∠ACB.
