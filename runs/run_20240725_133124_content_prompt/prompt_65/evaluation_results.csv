643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Okay, let's break down this geometry problem step-by-step. 

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle C (∠C) in the circle. We're given that:

* CD is the diameter of the circle (meaning it passes through the center O and divides the circle in half).
* DE is parallel to OA (meaning they never intersect and have the same angle).
* ∠D (angle D) measures 50 degrees.

**Solving the Problem**

1. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle:**  Since CD is the diameter, ∠COD is a central angle.  A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle.  ∠CAD is an inscribed angle, which is an angle whose vertex is on the circle.  

2. **Relationship between Central and Inscribed Angles:**  A central angle is always twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.  In our case, both ∠COD and ∠CAD intercept arc CD.  Therefore, ∠COD = 2 * ∠CAD.

3. **Finding ∠CAD:**  We know ∠D = 50 degrees. Since DE || OA, ∠CAD and ∠D are alternate interior angles, which are equal. Therefore, ∠CAD = 50 degrees.

4. **Finding ∠COD:**  Using the relationship from step 2, ∠COD = 2 * ∠CAD = 2 * 50 degrees = 100 degrees.

5. **Finding ∠C:**  We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  In triangle COD, we have: ∠C + ∠COD + ∠D = 180 degrees.  Substituting the values we know: ∠C + 100 degrees + 50 degrees = 180 degrees.  Solving for ∠C: ∠C = 180 degrees - 100 degrees - 50 degrees = 30 degrees.

**Answer**

The degree of ∠C is **30 degrees**.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"The problem is asking us to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, given one of the legs and one of the acute angles. 

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We know the length of the adjacent side (4) and we want to find the hypotenuse (h). The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is the cosine: 
   * cos(angle) = adjacent / hypotenuse

2. **Apply the trigonometric ratio:** In this case, the angle is 60 degrees. So, we can write:
   * cos(60°) = 4 / h

3. **Solve for the unknown:** To isolate h, we can multiply both sides of the equation by h and then divide both sides by cos(60°):
   * h * cos(60°) = 4
   * h = 4 / cos(60°)

4. **Calculate the value:** We know that cos(60°) = 1/2. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
   * h = 4 / (1/2)
   * h = 8

Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse (h) is **8**.

887,"As shown in the figure, △ABC is the inscribed triangle of ⊙O. If ∠ABC = 70.0, then the degree of ∠AOC is equal to ()",140°,"Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step. 

**What is the math problem asking us to solve?**

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AOC (∠AOC) in the diagram. We are given that triangle ABC is inscribed in circle O, and that angle ABC (∠ABC) is 70 degrees. 

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding Inscribed Angles:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share the same endpoint. The endpoint that is shared is called the vertex of the inscribed angle. In our problem, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle.

2. **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  

3. **Intercepted Arc:** The intercepted arc of an inscribed angle is the arc of the circle that lies between the two endpoints of the angle's chords. In our problem, the intercepted arc of ∠ABC is arc AC.

4. **Applying the Theorem:** Since ∠ABC is 70 degrees, according to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, arc AC is twice that measure, or 140 degrees (70 * 2 = 140).

5. **Central Angle:**  Angle AOC (∠AOC) is a central angle. A central angle is an angle whose vertex is the center of the circle. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

6. **Final Step:** Since arc AC is 140 degrees, and ∠AOC intercepts arc AC, then ∠AOC is also 140 degrees.

The degree of ∠AOC is **140**.

Let's look at the first triangle:

* The top number is 2.

If we add the bottom two numbers (6 + 2 = 8) and then divide by the top number (8 / 2 = 4), we get 4.

What is the $x$ component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3?",0.17,"The problem asks us to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3. This means we need to consider all the forces acting on particle 3 due to the other charges, and then find the component of each force that acts in the x-direction.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the forces:** Particle 3 experiences forces due to particles 1, 2, and 4. 
    * **Force due to particle 1:** This force is attractive because particles 1 and 3 have opposite charges. It acts along the diagonal of the square.
    * **Force due to particle 2:** This force is repulsive because particles 2 and 3 have the same charge. It acts horizontally to the right.
    * **Force due to particle 4:** This force is attractive because particles 3 and 4 have opposite charges. It acts vertically downwards.

2. **Calculate the magnitude of each force:** We can use Coulomb's Law to calculate the magnitude of each force:

    * **Coulomb's Law:**  F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
        * F is the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two charges.
        * k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2).

    * **Force due to particle 2:**
        * F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / a^2
    * **Force due to particle 4:**
        * F43 = k * |q4 * q3| / a^2

3. **Find the x-component of each force:**
    * **Force due to particle 1:** The x-component of this force is F13 * cos(45°) = F13 / √2.
    * **Force due to particle 2:** The x-component of this force is F23 (since it acts entirely in the x-direction).
    * **Force due to particle 4:** The x-component of this force is 0 (since it acts vertically).

4. **Add the x-components:** The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of the individual forces:

    * F_net_x = F13 / √2 + F23

5. **Substitute the values and calculate:**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Since $Q$ is the incenter, we know that $JQ$ is the distance from the incenter to side $JL$.  We also know that $Q$ is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle.  This means that $JQ$ is also equal to the distance from $Q$ to side $LN$ and the distance from $Q$ to side $JN$.

   * $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

   Where:
   * $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs of the right triangle
   * $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse

4. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $QPN$:** We know that $JP = 16.5$ and $PN$ is the same length as $MN$ because $Q$ is equidistant from all sides.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $PN$ (and therefore $MN$):

   * $PN^2 + QP^2 = JP^2$
   * $PN^2 + QP^2 = 16.5^2$

5. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $QMN$:** We know that $QM = 9$ and we just found $MN$ (which is the same length as $PN$).  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $QN$:

   * $QM^2 + MN^2 = QN^2$
   * $9^2 + MN^2 = QN^2$

6. **Solving for $QN$:**  We can now solve for $QN$ using the values we found for $MN$ and $QM$.

Here's how we can solve it:

1. **Understanding the problem:**
   - We know that DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB. This means that DE cuts AB in half, and it forms a right angle with AB.
   - We are given the perimeter of triangle ACE, which is the sum of its sides: AC + CE + AE = 13.
   - We need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC, which is the sum of its sides: AB + BC + AC.

2. **Using the properties of perpendicular bisectors:**
   - Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

3. **Finding the length of AC:**

Here's how we can solve it:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a parallelogram ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point F.
   - Line BE bisects angle ABC, meaning it divides angle ABC into two equal angles.
   - Line CF bisects angle BCD, meaning it divides angle BCD into two equal angles.
   - We know AB = 3 and AD = 4.
   - We need to find the length of EF.

2. **Using Properties of Parallelograms:**
   - **Opposite sides are equal:** AB = CD = 3 and AD = BC = 4.
   - **Opposite angles are equal:** ∠ABC = ∠ADC and ∠BAD = ∠BCD.

3. **Using Angle Bisector Theorem:**
   - **In triangle ABE:** BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC.  The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the sides opposite the bisected angles is equal to the ratio of the sides adjacent to the bisected angles. Therefore, AE/ED = AB/BD.
   - **In triangle DCF:** CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD. Applying the Angle Bisector Theorem again, we get DF/FC = DC/BC.

4. **Solving for EF:**
   - Since AB = CD = 3 and AD = BC = 4, we can substitute these values into the equations from step 3:
      - AE/ED = 3/BD
      - DF/FC = 3/4
   - Notice that AE + ED = AD = 4 and DF + FC = AD = 4.
   - We can now solve for AE, ED, DF, and FC using the above equations and the fact that AE + ED = 4 and DF + FC = 4.
   - Once we have the values of AE, ED, DF, and FC, we can find EF by subtracting the sum of AE and DF from AD: EF = AD - (AE + DF).

5. **Calculation:**
   - Let's solve for AE and ED:
      - AE/ED = 3/BD
      - AE = (3/BD) * ED
      - AE + ED = 4
      - (3/BD) * ED + ED = 4
      - ED * (3/BD + 1) = 4
      - ED = 4 / (3/BD + 1)
      - AE = 3 - ED
   - Similarly, we can solve for DF and FC:
      - DF/FC = 3/4
      - DF = (3/4) * FC
      - DF + FC = 4
      - (3/4) * FC + FC = 4
      - FC * (3/4 + 1) = 4
      - FC = 4 / (3/4 + 1)
      - DF = 3 - FC
   - Now, we can find EF:
      - EF = AD - (AE + DF)
      - EF = 4 - (3 - ED + 3 - FC)
      - EF = 4 - 6 + ED + FC
      - EF = -2 + ED + FC
      - Substitute the values of ED and FC we calculated earlier.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - After substituting the values of ED and FC and simplifying, we get the final answer for EF.

2. **Using the given information:** Since OD bisects angle AOE, we know that angle AOD is equal to angle DOE.  We also know that angles AOD and DOE together make up angle AOE.

3. **Finding angle AOE:**  We can find angle AOE by using the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.  Angle AOE and angle BOC are on a straight line, so:

   Angle AOE + Angle BOC = 180 degrees
   Angle AOE + 50 degrees = 180 degrees
   Angle AOE = 180 degrees - 50 degrees
   Angle AOE = 130 degrees

4. **Finding angle EOB:**  Since OD bisects angle AOE, we know that angle AOD is half of angle AOE:

   Angle AOD + Angle DOE + Angle EOB = 360 degrees
   65 degrees + 65 degrees + Angle EOB = 360 degrees
   130 degrees + Angle EOB = 360 degrees

Where:

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle P (∠P) in the diagram. We're given information about the central angles of arcs AB and CD, and we need to use that information to figure out the measure of ∠P.

**Solution**

1. **Central Angles and Inscribed Angles:**  The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles. 

   * **Central Angle:** An angle formed by two radii of a circle, with its vertex at the center of the circle. In our diagram, ∠AOB is the central angle of arc AB.
   * **Inscribed Angle:** An angle formed by two chords of a circle, with its vertex on the circle. In our diagram, ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AB.

   **Important Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted central angle.

2. **Finding ∠ACB and ∠ADB:**

   * Since ∠AOB (central angle of arc AB) is 90°, then ∠ACB (inscribed angle intercepting arc AB) is half of that: ∠ACB = 90°/2 = 45°.
   * Similarly, since ∠COD (central angle of arc CD) is 50°, then ∠ADB (inscribed angle intercepting arc CD) is half of that: ∠ADB = 50°/2 = 25°.

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem asks us to find the side length of a square that fits perfectly inside a circle. We know the circle's area is 18π square units. 

**Step 1: Finding the Circle's Radius**

* **Formula:** The area of a circle is given by  A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.
* **Applying the formula:** We know A = 18π, so we can plug that in: 18π = πr²
* **Solving for r:** Divide both sides by π: 18 = r²
* **Finding the radius:** Take the square root of both sides: r = √18 = 3√2

**Step 2: Relating the Radius to the Square's Diagonal**

* **Visualizing:** Imagine drawing a diagonal across the square. This diagonal will also be the diameter of the circle. 
* **Relationship:** The diameter of the circle is twice the radius: diameter = 2r = 2(3√2) = 6√2

**Step 3: Finding the Square's Side Length**

* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  The diagonal of a square divides it into two right-angled triangles. We can use the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) to find the side length.
* **Applying the theorem:** In this case, the diagonal (6√2) is the hypotenuse (c), and the sides of the square (a and b) are equal. So, we have: s² + s² = (6√2)²

   - Angle A measures 45 degrees (∠A = 45°)
   - Angle C measures 110 degrees (∠C = 110°)

2. **Apply the properties of parallel lines:**
   - When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.  Since AB // CD, we know that ∠A and ∠CDE are corresponding angles, so ∠CDE = ∠A = 45°.

The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that an angle bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.

**1. Understanding the Problem**

* **Tangent Line:** A tangent line touches a circle at exactly one point. In this case, line AB touches circle O at point A.
* **Radius:** Line segment OA is a radius of the circle because it connects the center of the circle (O) to a point on the circle (A).

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Understanding Cosine:**  In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.  

   * **Adjacent Side:** The side next to the angle (not the hypotenuse).
   * **Hypotenuse:** The longest side of the right triangle, opposite the right angle.

Where:

* **d1** is the length of the first diagonal
* **d2** is the length of the second diagonal

1. **Draw a diagram:**  We already have a diagram, but it's helpful to redraw it and label the important parts.  We know that OA, OB, and OC are all radii of the circle, so they are all equal to 2.

In this case, angle C is inscribed in the circle and subtends arc AB.  Therefore, the central angle AOB that subtends arc AB is twice the measure of angle C, which is 60 degrees.

3. **Apply the Law of Cosines:**  We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of AB.  The Law of Cosines states:

* **Rotation:** Triangle ABC is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around point A to form triangle AB'C'.
* **Angle:** We are given that ∠CC'B' = 32°.

**Solving the Problem**

1. **Visualize the Rotation:** Imagine rotating triangle ABC clockwise around point A.  This means that side AB will rotate to become side AB', and side AC will rotate to become side AC'.  The right angle at A will remain in the same position.

2. **Identify Key Angles:**  Since we rotated the triangle by 90 degrees, we know that:

   - We also know that CE bisects angle ACD, meaning it divides angle ACD into two equal angles.
   - We are given that angle BEC is 35 degrees.

2. **Using angle bisector properties:**
   - Since BE bisects angle FBD, we can say that angle FBE = angle EBD.
   - Similarly, since CE bisects angle ACD, we can say that angle ACE = angle ECD.

3. **Finding angles within triangles:**
   - Let's focus on triangle BEC.  We know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle BEC + angle CBE + angle BCE = 180 degrees.
   - We know angle BEC is 35 degrees.  We also know that angle CBE = angle EBD (from step 2) and angle BCE = angle ECD (from step 2).  Let's represent these equal angles as x.
   - So, we have 35 degrees + x + x = 180 degrees.
   - Simplifying, we get 2x = 145 degrees.
   - Therefore, x = 72.5 degrees.  This means angle CBE = angle EBD = 72.5 degrees, and angle BCE = angle ECD = 72.5 degrees.

4. **Finding angle FAE:**
   - Now, let's look at triangle ABE.  We know angle ABE = 72.5 degrees (from step 3).  We also know that angle BAE = angle FBA (since BE bisects angle FBD).  Let's represent this angle as y.
   - So, we have angle ABE + angle BAE + angle AEB = 180 degrees.
   - Substituting the values, we get 72.5 degrees + y + y = 180 degrees.
   - Simplifying, we get 2y = 107.5 degrees.
   - Therefore, y = 53.75 degrees.  This means angle BAE = angle FBA = 53.75 degrees.

5. **Final answer:**
   - Finally, we can find angle FAE.  Angle FAE = angle FBA + angle BAE = 53.75 degrees + 53.75 degrees = 107.5 degrees.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** Since ∠C is an inscribed angle, its measure is half the measure of arc AB. Therefore, arc AB measures 2 * 35° = 70°.

3. **Apply the Central Angle Theorem:** Angle AOB (∠AOB) is a central angle that intercepts arc AB.  According to the Central Angle Theorem, ∠AOB has the same measure as arc AB, which is 70°.

4. **Triangle Properties:** Triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle because OA and OB are radii of the circle, making them equal in length.  This means that angles OAB and OBA (∠OAB and ∠OBA) are also equal.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Understanding Tangent:** In a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.  We can write this as a formula:

   *  tan(angle) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)

2. **Identifying the Sides:**  We need to identify the sides opposite and adjacent to angle M.

   * **Opposite Side:** The side opposite angle M is PN, which has a length of 15.

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Identify the base and height:**
   - The base of the parallelogram is BC, which is 9.0 units long.
   - The height is the perpendicular distance from point A to line BC. We don't know this directly, but we can find it using trigonometry.

2. **Use trigonometry to find the height:**
   - We know angle B is 30 degrees, and we know the length of AB (the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by AB, the height, and the base).

   where 'side' is the length of a side of the equilateral triangle.

3. **Relating Areas to Sides:** Since we know the areas of triangles A'BC and AB'C, we can find their sides using the formula above:

   * For triangle A'BC: 10 = (√3 / 4) * (A'B)²
     Solving for A'B, we get A'B = √(40/√3)

   * For triangle AB'C: 4 = (√3 / 4) * (AB')²
     Solving for AB', we get AB' = √(16/√3)

4. **Using Pythagorean Theorem:** Triangle ABC is a right triangle, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides:

   ∠OAB = ∠OBA and ∠OBC = ∠OCB

4. **Apply the Angle Sum Property:** The angles inside any triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's apply this to triangle OAB:
   ∠OAB + ∠OBA + ∠AOB = 180°
   Since ∠OAB = ∠OBA, we can rewrite this as:
   2 * ∠OAB + 40° = 180°

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem asks us to find the length of line segment EF in a rhombus (a special type of parallelogram where all sides are equal). We are given that AB = 5 and AC = 6.

**Solution**

1. **Diagonals of a Rhombus:**  The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. This means that line segment AO is half the length of AC, and line segment BO is half the length of BD.

2. **Finding the Length of BD:** Since we know AC = 6, we know AO = AC/2 = 6/2 = 3.

3. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Triangle ABO is a right triangle (because the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BO:

   *  a² + b² = c² 
   *  3² + BO² = 5² (Since AB = 5 and AO = 3)
   *  BO² = 25 - 9 = 16
   *  BO = √16 = 4

4. **Finding the Length of BD:** Since BO is half the length of BD, we know BD = 2 * BO = 2 * 4 = 8.

5. **Finding the Length of EF:**  Triangle EFD is also a right triangle (because the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular). We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the length of EF:

   *  a² + b² = c²
   *  EF² + FD² = ED²
   *  EF² + (BD/2)² = (AB/2)² (Since FD is half of BD and ED is half of AB)
   *  EF² + (8/2)² = (5/2)²
   *  EF² + 16 = 25/4
   *  EF² = 25/4 - 16 = 9/4
   *  EF = √(9/4) = 3/2

**Understanding the Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the perimeter of a triangle with two sides measuring 12 and 7.  We need to figure out which of the given options cannot be the perimeter of this triangle.

**Key Concept: Triangle Inequality Theorem**

The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. This is a fundamental rule in geometry.

**Applying the Theorem:**

1. **Consider the two given sides:** We have sides of length 12 and 7.

2. **Find the possible range for the third side:**
   * The third side must be greater than the difference between the other two sides (12 - 7 = 5).
   * The third side must be less than the sum of the other two sides (12 + 7 = 19).

3. **Determine the possible perimeters:**
   * The perimeter is the sum of all three sides.
   * Since the third side can range from 5 to 19, the perimeter can range from 12 + 7 + 5 = 24 to 12 + 7 + 19 = 38.

**Answer:**

Therefore, any perimeter outside the range of 24 to 38 cannot be the perimeter of this triangle. 

**Important Note:** The problem doesn't provide us with the options to choose from. To find the specific option that cannot be the perimeter, you would need to compare the given options to the range we calculated (24 to 38).

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem gives us a shape made up of a square and an equilateral triangle. We know the area of the square is 1, and we need to find the perimeter of the whole shape.

**Step 1: Finding the side length of the square**

* **Formula:** Area of a square = side * side 
* **We know:** Area = 1
* **Let's call the side length of the square 's'.** So, we have the equation: s * s = 1
* **Solving for 's':**  s² = 1, which means s = 1 (since the side length can't be negative).

**Step 2: Finding the side length of the equilateral triangle**

* **We know:** The side length of the square (s) is also the base of the equilateral triangle. So, the side length of the triangle is also 1.

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Since OB bisects angle ABC, we know that angle ABO = angle CBO. Similarly, since OC bisects angle ACB, we know that angle ACO = angle BCO.

2. **Using Angle Sum Property:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle ABC:
   ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
   110° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
   ∠B + ∠C = 70°

3. **Focusing on Triangle BOC:**  We want to find ∠BOC.  Let's look at triangle BOC:
   ∠BOC + ∠OBC + ∠OCB = 180°

4. **Substituting and Solving:** We know that ∠OBC = 1/2 ∠B and ∠OCB = 1/2 ∠C.  Substituting these into the equation above:
   ∠BOC + (1/2)∠B + (1/2)∠C = 180°

   We also know that ∠B + ∠C = 70°.  Substituting this:
   ∠BOC + (1/2)(70°) = 180°
   ∠BOC + 35° = 180°

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the key information:**
   - We know that line a is parallel to line b (a∥b).
   - We know that triangle ABC is a right triangle, with angle C being 90 degrees (∠C = 90°).
   - We know that angle B is 58 degrees (∠B = 58°).

2. **Use the properties of parallel lines:**
   - When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal (a line that crosses them), corresponding angles are equal.  
   - Angle 1 and angle B are corresponding angles because they are in the same relative position at the intersection of the transversal and the parallel lines.  Therefore, angle 1 is also 58 degrees (∠1 = ∠B = 58°).

3. **Use the properties of triangles:**
   - The angles inside a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  
   - In triangle ABC, we know that angle C is 90 degrees and angle B is 58 degrees.  Therefore, angle A can be found by subtracting the other two angles from 180 degrees: ∠A = 180° - ∠B - ∠C = 180° - 58° - 90° = 32°.

4. **Find the relationship between angle 2 and angle A:**
   - Angle 2 and angle A are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.  This is because they form a straight line.  Therefore, angle 2 can be found by subtracting angle A from 180 degrees: ∠2 = 180° - ∠A = 180° - 32° = 148°.

5. **Calculate the difference between angle 1 and angle 2:**

Here's how we can solve this:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a quadrilateral ABCD with specific angle measures.
   - We need to find points M and N on sides BC and CD respectively.
   - Our goal is to minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN.
   - Finally, we need to find the sum of angles AMN and ANM.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The perimeter of a triangle is minimized when the triangle is isosceles. This means AM = AN.

3. **Finding Points M and N:**
   - To make AM = AN, we need to reflect point A across line BC. Let the reflection of A be A'.
   - Connect A' to D. The intersection of A'D and BC is point M.
   - Connect A' to C. The intersection of A'C and CD is point N.

4. **Why this works:**
   - Since A' is the reflection of A across BC, AM = A'M.
   - Similarly, AN = A'N.
   - Therefore, AM = AN, making triangle AMN isosceles.

5. **Calculating Angles:**
   - Since ∠BAD = 120°, ∠BAM = 180° - 120° = 60°.
   - Since ∠B = 90°, ∠AMB = 180° - 90° - 60° = 30°.
   - Since triangle AMN is isosceles, ∠AMN = ∠ANM.
   - In triangle AMN, ∠AMN + ∠ANM + ∠MAN = 180°.
   - Therefore, 2∠AMN + ∠MAN = 180°.
   - Since ∠MAN = ∠BAM = 60°, we have 2∠AMN + 60° = 180°.
   - Solving for ∠AMN, we get ∠AMN = 60°.

**Key Concepts**

* **Symmetry:** When two points are symmetrical with respect to a line, the line acts as a mirror, and the points are equidistant from the line.
* **Angles:**  Angles formed by symmetrical points are equal.

**Solution**

1. **Symmetry and Angles:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP. Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, we know that ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.

2. **Angle Relationships:**  We can see that ∠AMP + ∠BMP + ∠BAC = 180° (angles on a straight line).  Similarly, ∠ANQ + ∠CNQ + ∠BAC = 180°.

The theorem we need to use is the **Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem**. This theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

**Step 3: Set up the equation**

Let's call the intercepted arc formed by the tangent and secant *a*, and the intercepted arc formed by the secant and the circle *b*.  We can then write the following equation:

3*x* = 1/2 ( *a* - *b* )

**Step 4: Solve for *a* and *b***

We know that the angle formed by the tangent and the circle is (4*x* + 50) degrees. This angle intercepts the entire circle, which has 360 degrees. Therefore, we can write:

*a* = 360 degrees

We also know that the angle formed by the secant and the circle is 30 degrees. This angle intercepts the arc *b*. Therefore, we can write:

*b* = 30 degrees

**Step 5: Substitute and solve for *x***

Now we can substitute the values of *a* and *b* into our equation:

1. **Focus on a Repeating Pattern:** Notice that the circuit has a repeating pattern.  We can isolate a single repeating unit, which consists of three resistors in parallel (R, R, R) and one resistor in series (R).

2. **Calculate the Resistance of the Repeating Unit:**
   * **Parallel Resistors:** The equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel is calculated using the formula: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3...
     * In our case, 1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
     * Therefore, R_parallel = R/3

   * **Series Resistors:** The equivalent resistance of resistors in series is simply the sum of their individual resistances.
     * In our case, R_series = R + R_parallel = R + R/3 = 4R/3

3. **The Infinite Chain:** Now, imagine the entire infinite chain as a single resistor with an equivalent resistance 'R_total'.  This 'R_total' is the resistance between points 'a' and 'b'.

4. **Recursive Relationship:**  The infinite chain can be viewed as the repeating unit (with resistance 4R/3) connected in series with another infinite chain (with resistance R_total). This leads to a recursive relationship:

   * R_total = (4R/3) + R_total

5. **Solving for R_total:**
   * Subtract R_total from both sides: 0 = (4R/3)
   * Since R = 1, we have: 0 = 4/3. This is not possible!

**The Catch**

The problem lies in the assumption that the infinite chain has a finite resistance.  The recursive relationship we derived leads to a contradiction, indicating that the resistance between points 'a' and 'b' is actually **infinite**.

**Answer**

The resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is **infinite**.

If the area of each square is 9, what is the perimeter of ABCD?",18,"The problem is asking us to find the perimeter of rectangle ABCD, given that it is divided into two identical squares, each with an area of 9.

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Find the side length of each square:**
   - The area of a square is calculated by side length * side length (s * s).
   - We know the area is 9, so s * s = 9.
   - The square root of 9 is 3, so the side length of each square is 3.

2. **Determine the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   - The length of the rectangle is equal to the side length of two squares combined (3 + 3 = 6).
   - The width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square (3).

3. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by 2 * (length + width).

   - AB is parallel to CD (AB∥CD)
   - AF intersects CD at point E
   - BE is perpendicular to AF (BE⊥AF)
   - Angle B measures 65 degrees (∠B = 65°)

2. **Apply the properties of parallel lines:**
   - When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal. Since AB∥CD and AF is the transversal, we know that ∠B = ∠CED = 65°.

3. **Use the properties of perpendicular lines:**
   - Perpendicular lines form right angles. Since BE⊥AF, we know that ∠BEF = 90°.

4. **Apply the angle sum property of triangles:**
   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. In triangle BEF, we have:
     ∠BEF + ∠BFE + ∠EBF = 180°

1. **Understanding the Concept:**  Angles around a point add up to 360 degrees. This means that the sum of all the angles at point C (∠NCR, ∠RCN, ∠NCL, and ∠LCM) must equal 360 degrees.

2. **Setting up the Equation:** We can write this as an equation:
   (x - 1)° + 60° + (3x + 5)° + ∠LCM = 360°

3. **Finding ∠LCM:**  We need to find the measure of ∠LCM. Since we don't have any information about it directly, we can use the fact that ∠LCM and ∠RCN are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees). 

   ∠LCM + ∠RCN = 180°
   ∠LCM + (x - 1)° = 180°
   ∠LCM = 180° - (x - 1)°
   ∠LCM = 181° - x

4. **Substituting and Solving:** Now we can substitute the value of ∠LCM back into our original equation:
   (x - 1)° + 60° + (3x + 5)° + (181° - x) = 360°

   Combining like terms:
   4x + 245° = 360°

280,"In the figure above, ABCDEF is a regular hexagon, and its center is point O. What is the value of x?",60,"Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step. 

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem asks us to find the value of angle x. We know that ABCDEF is a regular hexagon, which means all its sides are equal, and all its interior angles are equal.  The point O is the center of the hexagon.

**Solution**

1. **Interior Angles of a Hexagon:**  A hexagon has 6 sides. We can use the formula to find the sum of the interior angles of any polygon:

   * **Sum of Interior Angles = (n - 2) * 180°** 
   * Where 'n' is the number of sides.

   * For a hexagon (n = 6), the sum of interior angles is (6 - 2) * 180° = 720°.

2. **Each Interior Angle of a Regular Hexagon:** Since all the interior angles of a regular hexagon are equal, we can find the measure of each angle by dividing the total sum by 6:

   * **Each Interior Angle = 720° / 6 = 120°**

3. **Angle at the Center:**  The hexagon is divided into 6 congruent triangles by lines drawn from the center O to each vertex.  Each of these triangles is an isosceles triangle because two of its sides are radii of the hexagon.

   * **Angle at the Center = 360° / 6 = 60°** (The central angle of each triangle is 1/6th of the total circle)

4. **Angle x:**  Now, focus on triangle ABO. We know:

   * Angle ABO = 120° (interior angle of the hexagon)
   * Angle AOB = 60° (central angle of the triangle)

   * Using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, we can find angle x:

   * **x° = 180° - 120° - 60° = 0°**

**Answer**

The value of x is **0°**. 

**Double-Check**

It seems a bit strange that x is 0°. Let's think about it:  Since angle ABO is 120°, and angle AOB is 60°, the line BO must be overlapping with line AB. This means that point B and point O are actually the same point, making angle x equal to 0°.

Here's how we can solve it:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:** We know that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts both minor arc AC and major arc ADC.

2. **Setting up the Equation:**  We can write this relationship as an equation:

   m∠ABC = (1/2) * (m arc AC + m arc ADC)

3. **Substituting Values:** We are given that m∠ABC = 70° and we know that m arc AC = x and m arc ADC = y.  Let's substitute these values into our equation:

   70° = (1/2) * (x + y)

4. **Solving for x:**  We need to find x, but we also have y in the equation.  To eliminate y, we can use the fact that the entire circle has 360 degrees.  This means:

   x + y = 360°

5. **Substituting and Solving:** Now we can substitute this value of (x + y) back into our equation:

   70° = (1/2) * (360°)
   70° = 180°

   This is not possible!  We made a mistake somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.

6. **Identifying the Error:**  The error is in assuming that x + y = 360°.  This is only true if x and y represent the entire circle.  However, x represents only the minor arc AC, and y represents the major arc ADC.  The sum of these two arcs is 360°.

7. **Correcting the Equation:**  We need to adjust our equation to reflect this:

   m∠ABC = (1/2) * (m arc ADC - m arc AC)

   This is because the inscribed angle intercepts the difference between the major and minor arcs.

8. **Solving for x:**  Let's substitute the values again:

   70° = (1/2) * (y - x)
   140° = y - x

   We still need to eliminate y.  We know that x + y = 360°.  Solving for y, we get:

   y = 360° - x

9. **Final Calculation:**  Substituting this value of y into our equation:

   140° = (360° - x) - x
   140° = 360° - 2x
   2x = 220°
   x = 110°

**Solution:**

1. **Tangents and Radii:**  Remember that a tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠DBO and ∠DCO are both right angles (90°).

   * ∠DBC = 90° (tangent to radius)
   * ∠DCB = 90° (tangent to radius)
   * ∠D + ∠DBC + ∠DCB = 180° 
   * ∠D + 90° + 90° = 180°
   * ∠D = 180° - 180° = 0°

   * ∠ACE + ∠ACD = 180°

   * ∠ACD = 180° - 25° = 155°

4. **Angles in a Triangle (Again):** Now let's look at triangle ACD:

1. **Identify the sides:** We know that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.  So, we have two sides that are 23 feet long and two sides that are 16 feet long.

2. **Find the missing side:**  We need to find the length of the side that is not labeled.  To do this, we can use trigonometry.  We know that the angle opposite the missing side is 60 degrees, and we know the length of the adjacent side (23 feet).  We can use the tangent function to find the length of the opposite side:

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**1. Understanding the Problem**

The problem gives us a diagram with two angles, labeled x and y, and a third angle of 70 degrees. We know that the angles x, y, and 70 degrees form a straight angle, which means they add up to 180 degrees. We are also told that y is equal to the square of x. Our goal is to find the value of y.

**2. Setting up the Equation**

* **Angles on a Straight Line:**  We know that the angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + y + 70 = 180
* **Relationship between x and y:** We are given that y = x².

**3. Solving for x**

* **Substitute:** Since we know y = x², we can substitute that into our equation: x + x² + 70 = 180
* **Simplify:** Combine like terms: x² + x - 110 = 0
* **Factor:** Factor the quadratic equation: (x + 11)(x - 10) = 0
* **Solve for x:** This gives us two possible solutions: x = -11 or x = 10.  Since angles cannot be negative, we discard x = -11.

**4. Solving for y**

* **Use the relationship:** We know y = x², and we found x = 10.
* **Calculate:** Substitute x = 10 into the equation: y = 10² = 100

**Answer:**

The value of y is **100**.
