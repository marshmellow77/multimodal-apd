643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. **Problem:** In a circle with center O, CD is the diameter, chord DE is parallel to chord OA, and the measure of angle D is 50 degrees. Find the measure of angle C.

2. **Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
    * Since CD is a diameter, angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.
    * Angle CDO is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as central angle COD. Therefore, angle CDO is half the measure of angle COD, or 90 degrees.
    * Angle DOE is supplementary to angle CDO, so angle DOE measures 90 degrees.
    * Angle OED is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as central angle DOE. Therefore, angle OED is half the measure of angle DOE, or 45 degrees.
    * Angle AED is supplementary to angle OED, so angle AED measures 135 degrees.
    * Angle ADE is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as central angle AOE. Therefore, angle ADE is half the measure of angle AOE.
    * Angle AOD is supplementary to angle COD, so angle AOD measures 90 degrees.
    * Angle AOE is supplementary to angle DOE, so angle AOE measures 90 degrees.
    * Since DE is parallel to OA, angle AED is congruent to angle OAE, so angle OAE measures 135 degrees.
    * Angle CAE is supplementary to angle OAE, so angle CAE measures 45 degrees.

* **Step 2: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**
    * In triangle CAE, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle C + angle CAE + angle CEA = 180 degrees.
    * Substituting the known values, we get angle C + 45 degrees + 135 degrees = 180 degrees.

* **Step 3: Solve for angle C.**
    * Simplifying the equation, we get angle C + 180 degrees = 180 degrees.
    * Subtracting 180 degrees from both sides, we get angle C = 0 degrees.

3. **Answer:** The degree of angle C is **0 degrees**.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"1. **Problem:** Find the length of the hypotenuse, $h$, of a right triangle given one leg is 4 units long and the angle opposite that leg is 60 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
    * **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We know the opposite side (4) and want to find the hypotenuse ($h$). The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and hypotenuse is the sine function:  sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse.
    * **Set up the equation:**  sin(60°) = 4/h
    * **Solve for h:**
        * Multiply both sides by h: h * sin(60°) = 4
        * Divide both sides by sin(60°): h = 4 / sin(60°)
        * Evaluate sin(60°) = √3/2
        * Substitute and simplify: h = 4 / (√3/2) = 8/√3
        * Rationalize the denominator: h = (8/√3) * (√3/√3) = 8√3 / 3

2. **Solution:**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, ∠ABC intercepts arc AC, and m∠ABC = (1/2)m(arc AC) = 70°.  This means m(arc AC) = 140°.

* **Central Angle Theorem:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  ∠AOC is a central angle that intercepts arc AC.  Therefore, m∠AOC = m(arc AC) = 140°.

If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"1. **Problem:**  The problem asks us to find the radius of the smaller circle given that the radius of the larger circle is 4 and that the centers of both circles lie on the same line.

2. **Solution:**
   - Since P and Q lie on the same line, the distance between them is equal to the difference between the radius of the larger circle and the radius of the smaller circle.
   - Let 'r' be the radius of the smaller circle.
   - The distance between P and Q is 4 - r (radius of larger circle - radius of smaller circle).
   - The distance between Q and R is equal to the radius of the smaller circle, which is 'r'.
   - Since P, Q, and R lie on the same line, the distance between P and R is the sum of the distances between P and Q and Q and R.
   - Therefore, 4 = (4 - r) + r
   - Simplifying the equation, we get 4 = 4.

3. **Answer:** The radius of the smaller circle is **2**. This is because the distance between P and Q is 2 (4 - 2 = 2), and the distance between Q and R is 2.

**1. Problem:**

The image shows two intersecting lines AB and CD, with point O as their intersection. Ray OE bisects angle BOC. Given that angle AOD is 70 degrees, find the measure of angle AOE.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles.**
    * We are given that ∠AOD = 70°.
    * Since ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), we can find ∠BOD:
        * ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.
    * We know that ray OE bisects ∠BOC, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts. Therefore, ∠BOE = ∠COE.

* **Step 2: Use the angle addition postulate.**
    * The angle addition postulate states that the measure of a larger angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its smaller adjacent angles.
    * Applying this to ∠BOD, we have: ∠BOD = ∠BOE + ∠COE.
    * Since ∠BOE = ∠COE, we can rewrite this as: ∠BOD = 2 * ∠BOE.

* **Step 3: Solve for ∠BOE.**
    * We know ∠BOD = 110°. Substituting this into the equation from Step 2, we get: 110° = 2 * ∠BOE.
    * Dividing both sides by 2, we find: ∠BOE = 55°.

* **Step 4: Find ∠AOE.**
    * ∠AOE and ∠BOE are adjacent angles that form ∠AOB, which is a straight angle (180°).
    * Therefore, ∠AOE + ∠BOE = 180°.
    * Substituting the value of ∠BOE, we get: ∠AOE + 55° = 180°.
    * Subtracting 55° from both sides, we find: ∠AOE = 125°.

* **Understanding Medians and Area:** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  The key property we'll use is that a median divides a triangle into two triangles with equal areas.

2. **Solution:**
* The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  This point is equidistant from the sides of the triangle.
* Since $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$, we know that $JQ$ is the distance from $Q$ to side $JL$.
* To find $JQ$, we can use the formula for the inradius of a triangle: $r = \frac{K}{s}$, where $r$ is the inradius, $K$ is the area of the triangle, and $s$ is the semiperimeter of the triangle.
* We know that $JL = 16.5$.  To find the area of $\triangle JLN$, we need to find the length of $LN$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $LMN$ to find $LN$:
    * $LN^2 = LM^2 + MN^2$
    * $LN^2 = 9^2 + 9^2$
    * $LN^2 = 162$
    * $LN = \sqrt{162} = 9\sqrt{2}$
* Now we can find the area of $\triangle JLN$:
    * $K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot JL \cdot LN$
    * $K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 16.5 \cdot 9\sqrt{2}$
    * $K = 74.25\sqrt{2}$
* The semiperimeter of $\triangle JLN$ is:
    * $s = \frac{JL + LN + JN}{2}$
    * $s = \frac{16.5 + 9\sqrt{2} + JN}{2}$
* To find $JN$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $JQN$:
    * $JN^2 = JQ^2 + QN^2$
    * $JN^2 = JQ^2 + (QN)^2$
    * $JN^2 = JQ^2 + (r)^2$
* Since $JQ$ is the inradius, we can substitute $r$ for $JQ$ in the equation above:
    * $JN^2 = r^2 + r^2$
    * $JN^2 = 2r^2$
    * $JN = r\sqrt{2}$
* Now we can substitute $r\sqrt{2}$ for $JN$ in the semiperimeter equation:
    * $s = \frac{16.5 + 9\sqrt{2} + r\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* Now we can substitute the values we found for $K$ and $s$ into the inradius formula:
    * $r = \frac{K}{s}$
    * $r = \frac{74.25\sqrt{2}}{\frac{16.5 + 9\sqrt{2} + r\sqrt{2}}{2}}$
* To solve for $r$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator:
    * $r \cdot \frac{16.5 + 9\sqrt{2} + r\sqrt{2}}{2} = 74.25\sqrt{2}$
    * $8.25r + 4.5r\sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{2}r^2\sqrt{2} = 74.25\sqrt{2}$
* We can rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation:
    * $\frac{1}{2}r^2\sqrt{2} + 8.25r + 4.5r\sqrt{2} - 74.25\sqrt{2} = 0$

    * $r = \frac{-(8.25 + 4.5\sqrt{2}) \pm \sqrt{(8.25 + 4.5\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2} \cdot (-74.25\sqrt{2})}}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2}}$

The image depicts a parallelogram ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point F. The angle bisector of ∠ABC intersects AD at point E, and the angle bisector of ∠BCD intersects AD at point F. Given that AB = 3 and AD = 4, find the length of EF.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Properties of Parallelograms and Angle Bisectors**

   - Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel.
   - Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal.
   - The angle bisector of an angle divides the angle into two equal angles.

* **Step 2: Apply the Properties to the Given Figure**

   - Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD = 3 and BC = AD = 4.
   - ∠ABC = ∠CDA and ∠BCD = ∠DAB.
   - Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, ∠ABE = ∠CBE.
   - Since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

2. **Solution:**

* **Understanding the problem:** We need to find the angle ∠EOB. We know that OD bisects ∠AOE, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts. We also know ∠BOC = 50°.

* **Using angle relationships:**

2. **Solution:**
* **Find the radius of the circle:** The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius. We are given that the area of the circle is $18\pi$ square units.  Substituting this into the formula, we get:

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles.**

**2. Solution:**

* **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the length of the line segment DE, which connects the midpoints of two sides of the right triangle. This line segment is known as the **midsegment** of the triangle.

* **Key Property:** A fundamental property of triangles states that the midsegment connecting the midpoints of two sides is parallel to the third side and half its length.

In triangle ABC, N is the midpoint of BC, AM bisects angle BAC, and BM is perpendicular to AM at point M. If AB = 8 and MN = 2, find the length of AC.

## Solution:

1. **Draw a diagram:**  The problem provides a diagram, but it's helpful to redraw it with the given information labeled.

2. **Identify key relationships:**
    * **Angle bisector theorem:**  Since AM bisects angle BAC, we know that AB/AC = BM/MC.
    * **Right triangle properties:** Triangle BMN is a right triangle, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem: BM² + MN² = BN².

3. **Solve for BM:**
    * We know MN = 2 and BN = BC/2 (since N is the midpoint of BC).  To find BC, we need to use the fact that AB = 8.
    * Since AM bisects angle BAC, we can use the angle bisector theorem to find the ratio of AB to AC.  Let x be the length of AC. Then, AB/AC = BM/MC = 8/x.
    * Since BM is perpendicular to AM, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle BMN: BM² + MN² = BN².  Substituting the known values, we get BM² + 2² = (BC/2)².
    * We need to find BC.  Since AB = 8 and AM bisects angle BAC, we can use the angle bisector theorem again: AB/AC = BM/MC = 8/x.  This means that BM/MC = 8/x.  Since BM + MC = BC, we can write BC = BM + MC = BM + (8/x)BM = (1 + 8/x)BM.
    * Substituting this value of BC into the Pythagorean theorem equation, we get BM² + 2² = ((1 + 8/x)BM/2)².
    * Simplifying the equation, we get BM² + 4 = (1/4)(1 + 16/x + 64/x²)BM².
    * Rearranging the terms, we get (3/4)BM² - (4/x)BM - (16/x²)BM² + 4 = 0.
    * This is a quadratic equation in BM.  Solving for BM using the quadratic formula, we get BM = (4/x ± √(16/x² + 48/x²)) / (3/2).
    * Simplifying, we get BM = (8/3x) ± (8/3x)√(1 + 3).
    * Since BM is a length, it must be positive.  Therefore, BM = (8/3x)(1 + √4) = (16/3x).

4. **Solve for AC:**
    * Now that we know BM, we can use the angle bisector theorem to find AC: AB/AC = BM/MC = 8/x = (16/3x) / MC.
    * Solving for MC, we get MC = (2/3)x.
    * Since BC = BM + MC, we can substitute the values we found: BC = (16/3x) + (2/3)x = (18/3x) = 6x.
    * Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know BN = BC/2 = 3x.
    * Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle BMN, we can find BN: BM² + MN² = BN².  Substituting the known values, we get (16/3x)² + 2² = (3x)².
    * Simplifying the equation, we get 256/9x² + 4 = 9x².
    * Rearranging the terms, we get (81/9)x² - (256/9)x² = 4.
    * Simplifying, we get (-175/9)x² = 4.

* **Step 2: Analyze Triangle PAB**
   - Since PA = PB, triangle PAB is an isosceles triangle.
   - The angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. Therefore, ∠PAB = ∠PBA.
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, ∠PAB + ∠PBA + ∠P = 180 degrees.
   - Substituting ∠P = 50 degrees, we get ∠PAB + ∠PBA + 50 = 180.
   - Since ∠PAB = ∠PBA, we have 2 * ∠PAB = 130 degrees.
   - Therefore, ∠PAB = ∠PBA = 65 degrees.

* **Step 3: Analyze Triangle OAB**
   - We know ∠OAB = ∠OBA = 90 degrees.
   - The sum of angles in triangle OAB is 180 degrees. So, ∠OAB + ∠OBA + ∠AOB = 180 degrees.
   - Substituting the known angles, we get 90 + 90 + ∠AOB = 180.
   - Therefore, ∠AOB = 0 degrees.

* **Step 4: Analyze Triangle ACB**
   - Since AC is the diameter, ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the entire circle.
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
   - Since ∠AOB = 0 degrees, the intercepted arc AB is also 0 degrees.
   - Therefore, ∠ACB = 0/2 = 0 degrees.

Two squares are drawn on the sides of length 8 and 14. The area of the square with side length 8 is given as 64. We need to find the area of the square with side length A.

2. **Solution:**

* **Understanding the Relationship:** The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of its side.  Since we know the area of the square with side length 8 is 64, we can find the side length of the square with side length A using the Pythagorean theorem.

* **Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In this case, the hypotenuse is the side with length 14, and the other two sides are 8 and A.

Triangle ABC is rotated clockwise around point A by 90 degrees to obtain triangle AB'C'.  Line segment CC' is drawn. If angle CC'B' is 32 degrees, what is the measure of angle AC'B'?

2. **Solution:**

* **Understanding the Rotation:** Rotating triangle ABC by 90 degrees clockwise means that each point in the triangle moves 90 degrees in a clockwise direction around point A. This results in triangle AB'C' where:
    * Angle B'AC' is 90 degrees (since it's a rotation of angle BAC).
    * Angle AB'C' is equal to angle ABC (corresponding angles after rotation).
    * Angle AC'B' is equal to angle ACB (corresponding angles after rotation).

* **Analyzing the Angles:**
    * Since angle B'AC' is 90 degrees, and angle CC'B' is 32 degrees, we can find angle AC'C' using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees:
        * Angle AC'C' = 180 - 90 - 32 = 58 degrees.

* **Finding Angle AC'B':**
    * Angle AC'B' is equal to angle ACB (from the rotation).
    * Angle ACB is the complement of angle ABC (since they are angles in a right triangle).
    * Therefore, angle AC'B' = 90 - angle ABC.

* **Relating Angles:**
    * We know that angle AB'C' is equal to angle ABC (from the rotation).

Given that point A and C lie on the two sides BF and BD of ∠FBD, BE bisects ∠FBD, CE bisects ∠ACD, and AE is connected. If ∠BEC = 35°, find the measure of ∠FAE.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the problem:** We are given a diagram with angles and bisectors. We need to find the measure of ∠FAE using the given information.

2. **Using angle bisector properties:** Since BE bisects ∠FBD, we have ∠FBE = ∠EBD. Similarly, since CE bisects ∠ACD, we have ∠ACE = ∠ECD.

   35° + ∠ACE + ∠EBD = 180°

4. **Simplifying the equation:** Combining like terms, we get:

   ∠FAE = 145° + ∠CAE
   ∠FBD = 2∠EBD

7. **Final step:** Since ∠FBD is the sum of ∠FBE and ∠EBD, and ∠FBE = ∠EBD, we have ∠FBD = 2∠EBD. Therefore, ∠EBD = ∠FBD/2.

   Substituting this value in the equation for ∠FAE, we get:

   ∠FAE = 145° + ∠CAE = 145° + (∠FBD/2)

   Since ∠FBD is the sum of ∠FBE and ∠EBD, and ∠FBE = ∠EBD, we have ∠FBD = 2∠EBD. Therefore, ∠EBD = ∠FBD/2.

    *  ∠CDE is an angle formed by a secant and a tangent to circle O, intercepting arc CD.
* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
    * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, ∠ABC = 1/2 * arc AC = 60°. This means arc AC = 120°.

* **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the positions of points M and N on the sides BC and CD respectively, that minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN. This is a classic optimization problem.

* **Key Insight:** The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Therefore, to minimize the perimeter of △AMN, we need to ensure that AM and AN are the shortest possible distances from point A to lines BC and CD respectively.

* **Construction:** Draw perpendiculars from point A to lines BC and CD, intersecting them at points M and N respectively. This ensures that AM and AN are the shortest possible distances.

* **Geometric Analysis:**
    * Since ∠BAD = 120°, and ∠BAM = ∠DAN = 90°, we have ∠MAN = 360° - 120° - 90° - 90° = 60°.
    * Triangle AMN is an isosceles triangle because AM = AN (shortest distances).
    * Therefore, ∠AMN = ∠ANM = (180° - ∠MAN) / 2 = (180° - 60°) / 2 = 60°.

2. **Solution:**
   - The diagram shows two parallel lines intersected by a transversal.
   - The angles marked with ""x"" are corresponding angles, which are equal in measure.
   - Therefore, we can set the expressions for the two angles equal to each other: 20 - 5x = 2x + 6
   - Solve for x:
      - Combine like terms: 20 - 6 = 2x + 5x
      - Simplify: 14 = 7x
      - Divide both sides by 7: x = 2
   - Now, we can substitute the value of x into either of the expressions for the corresponding angles to find the measure of the angle. Let's use 20 - 5x:
      - 20 - 5(2) = 20 - 10 = 10
   - The angle marked with ""y"" is supplementary to the angle we just found (10 degrees). Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, y + 10 = 180
   - Solve for y:
      - Subtract 10 from both sides: y = 170
   - The angle marked with ""3/5y + 2"" is also supplementary to the angle we found earlier (10 degrees).
   - Therefore, 3/5y + 2 + 10 = 180
   - Solve for y:
      - Combine like terms: 3/5y + 12 = 180
      - Subtract 12 from both sides: 3/5y = 168
      - Multiply both sides by 5/3: y = 280

2. **Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify congruent angles.** Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, we know that angle A is congruent to angle D, angle B is congruent to angle E, and angle C is congruent to angle F. Therefore, angle D = 22 degrees.

* **Step 2: Find angle BCD.** Since CD bisects angle BCA, we know that angle BCD = angle ACD = (1/2) * angle BCA.  We also know that angle BCA is congruent to angle F, so angle BCD = (1/2) * angle F.

* **Step 3: Find angle F.**  We know that angle CGF + angle F + angle GFC = 180 degrees (angles in a triangle).  We are given that angle CGF = 88 degrees, and since angle GFC is a straight angle, it equals 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle F = 180 - 88 - 180 = -88 degrees.  However, angles cannot be negative, so we must add 360 degrees to get angle F = 272 degrees.

* **Step 4: Find angle BCD.**  Using the information from step 2, we know that angle BCD = (1/2) * angle F = (1/2) * 272 degrees = 136 degrees.

* **Step 5: Find angle E.**  We know that angle BCD + angle D + angle E = 180 degrees (angles in a triangle).  Substituting the values we know, we get 136 degrees + 22 degrees + angle E = 180 degrees.  Solving for angle E, we get angle E = 180 - 136 - 22 = 22 degrees.

2. **Solution:**

* **Symmetry:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP. Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, we know that ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.

* **Angles in a triangle:** The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle ABC:

2. **Solution:**

* **Understanding the Geometry:** The diagram shows a circle with two intersecting chords and a tangent line. We need to use the following geometric relationships:
    * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * **Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem:** The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

* **Applying the Theorems:**
    * The angle measuring 30° is formed by a tangent and a chord, so it intercepts an arc with a measure of 2 * 30° = 60°.
    * The angle measuring 3x° is inscribed in the circle and intercepts the same arc of 60°. Therefore, 3x° = 60°/2 = 30°.
    * The angle measuring (4x + 50)° is also inscribed in the circle and intercepts the remaining portion of the circle, which has a measure of 360° - 60° = 300°. Therefore, (4x + 50)° = 300°/2 = 150°.

* **Solving for x:**
    * From the equation 3x° = 30°, we get x = 10.
    * We can also verify this by substituting x = 10 into the equation (4x + 50)° = 150°. This gives us (4 * 10 + 50)° = 150°, which is true.

2. **Solution:**

* **Understanding the Circuit:** The circuit consists of an infinite series of repeating units. Each unit comprises three resistors connected in parallel, with each of these parallel branches connected in series with another resistor.

* **Simplifying the Circuit:** To find the equivalent resistance, we can focus on one repeating unit and use the concept of symmetry. Let's consider the unit starting from point 'a' and moving towards the right.

* **Parallel Resistors:** The three resistors in parallel within the unit have a combined resistance (R_parallel) calculated as:
    1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
    R_parallel = R/3

* **Series Resistors:** This parallel combination is then connected in series with another resistor (R). The total resistance of this unit (R_unit) is:
    R_unit = R_parallel + R = R/3 + R = 4R/3

* **Symmetry and Recursion:** Now, the key observation is that the rest of the infinite chain to the right of this unit is identical to the original circuit. This means the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain (R_total) is equal to the resistance of one unit (R_unit) plus the resistance of the remaining infinite chain (which is also R_total). This can be expressed as:
    R_total = R_unit + R_total

* **Solving for R_total:** Substituting R_unit = 4R/3, we get:
    R_total = 4R/3 + R_total
    0 = 4R/3
    R_total = -4R/3

* **Physical Interpretation:** The negative value for R_total seems counterintuitive. However, it signifies that the equivalent resistance of an infinite chain of resistors is undefined. This is because the current can flow infinitely far along the chain, effectively creating a short circuit.

* **Step 1: Identify key properties**
    *  Since DB and DC are tangents to the circle, they are perpendicular to the radii OB and OC, respectively. Therefore, ∠OBD = ∠OCD = 90°.
    *  ∠ABO = ∠ACO = 90° (angles in a semicircle are right angles).

* **Step 2: Apply angle relationships**
    *  ∠BOC = 180° - ∠ABO - ∠ACO = 180° - 90° - 90° = 0°. This means points B, O, and C are collinear.
    *  ∠BDC = ∠BDO + ∠CDO = 90° + 90° = 180°. This means points B, D, and C are collinear.

* **Step 3:  Find ∠D**
    *  Since points B, O, and C are collinear, and points B, D, and C are collinear, then points B, O, D, and C are all on the same line.
    *  Therefore, ∠D = ∠ACE = 25°.

757,Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.,7.2,"1. **Problem:** Find the length of segment *x* in the given diagram, where a circle is intersected by two secants. 

2. **Solution:**
   * **Understanding the Theorem:** We can use the Secant-Secant Theorem, which states that when two secants intersect outside a circle, the product of the external segment of one secant and its whole length is equal to the product of the external segment of the other secant and its whole length. 
   * **Applying the Theorem:** In this case, we have:
      * External segment of one secant = 8
      * Whole length of one secant = 8 + *x*
      * External segment of the other secant = 12
      * Whole length of the other secant = 12 + 15 = 27
   * **Setting up the Equation:** According to the Secant-Secant Theorem: 8(8 + *x*) = 12(27)
   * **Solving for *x*:**
      * Expand the equation: 64 + 8*x* = 324
      * Subtract 64 from both sides: 8*x* = 260
      * Divide both sides by 8: *x* = 32.5

364,"As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of ⊙O, and points C and D are on ⊙O. If ∠ABD = 50.0, then the degree of ∠BCD is ()",40°,"1. **Problem:**  In circle O, AB is the diameter, and points C and D lie on the circle. Given that ∠ABD = 50°, find the measure of ∠BCD.

2. **Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
    * Since AB is the diameter, ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the entire circle. Therefore, ∠ACB is a right angle (90°).
    * ∠ABD and ∠ACD are both inscribed angles that intercept the same arc AD.  Inscribed angles that intercept the same arc are congruent. Therefore, ∠ACD = ∠ABD = 50°.

* **Step 2: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**
    * In triangle BCD, we have: ∠BCD + ∠CBD + ∠CDB = 180°
    * We know ∠ACD = 50° and ∠ACB = 90°. Since ∠ACD and ∠CBD are supplementary angles, ∠CBD = 180° - 50° = 130°.
    * Substituting the values into the angle sum equation: ∠BCD + 130° + 90° = 180°

* **Step 3: Solve for ∠BCD.**
    * Simplifying the equation: ∠BCD + 220° = 180°
    * Subtracting 220° from both sides: ∠BCD = -40°

* **Step 4: Adjust for positive angle measure.**
    * Since angles in a triangle must be positive, we add 360° to the negative angle: ∠BCD = -40° + 360° = 320°

3. **Answer:** The degree of ∠BCD is **320°**.

930,如图，F是△ABC的角平分线CD和BE的交点，CG⊥AB于点G．若∠ACG＝32°，则∠BFC的度数是（）,119°,"1. **Problem:** In triangle ABC, F is the intersection of angle bisector CD and BE. CG is perpendicular to AB at point G. If angle ACG = 32 degrees, find the measure of angle BFC.

2. **Solution:**

* **Step 1:** Since CG is perpendicular to AB, angle CGB is a right angle (90 degrees).
* **Step 2:** We know that angle ACG = 32 degrees. Therefore, angle BCG = 90 degrees - 32 degrees = 58 degrees.
* **Step 3:** CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB. This means angle ACD = angle BCD.
* **Step 4:** Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle ACD (or BCD): angle ACD = (180 degrees - angle ACG - angle BCG) / 2 = (180 degrees - 32 degrees - 58 degrees) / 2 = 45 degrees.
* **Step 5:** Similarly, BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, so angle ABE = angle CBE.
* **Step 6:** Using the same logic as in step 4, we can find angle ABE (or CBE): angle ABE = (180 degrees - angle BAC - angle ABC) / 2. However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate angle BAC or ABC.
* **Step 7:**  Focus on triangle BFC. We know angle BCF = 45 degrees (from step 4) and angle CBF = angle CBE (from step 5).
* **Step 8:**  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle BFC: angle BFC = 180 degrees - angle BCF - angle CBF = 180 degrees - 45 degrees - angle CBE.
* **Step 9:**  We still need to find angle CBE. Notice that angle CBE and angle ABE are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees). Therefore, angle CBE = 180 degrees - angle ABE.
* **Step 10:**  Substitute the expression for angle CBE from step 9 into the equation from step 8: angle BFC = 180 degrees - 45 degrees - (180 degrees - angle ABE) = angle ABE - 45 degrees.
* **Step 11:**  We still don't know the exact value of angle ABE, but we know it's half of angle ABC. Therefore, angle BFC = (angle ABC / 2) - 45 degrees.

2. **Solution:**

* **Understanding Regular Polygons:** A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal.
* **Central Angle:** The central angle of a regular polygon is formed by connecting the center of the polygon to two consecutive vertices. The measure of each central angle in a regular polygon is 360 degrees divided by the number of sides.
* **Angle at the Center:** In this case, the central angle AOB of the pentagon is 360 degrees / 5 sides = 72 degrees.
* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle in a circle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Angle ADE intercepts arc ABE, which is twice the central angle AOB.
* **Calculation:** Therefore, angle ADE = (1/2) * 2 * 72 degrees = 72 degrees.
