643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Properties:**
   - **Diameter:** CD is the diameter of the circle, meaning it passes through the center O and divides the circle into two equal halves.
   - **Parallel Lines:** DE is parallel to OA, which means they have the same angle measures when intersected by a transversal (like line CO).
   - **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle (like ∠D) is half the measure of its intercepted arc (arc CE).

2. **Finding the Measure of Arc CE:**
   - Since ∠D = 50°, and it intercepts arc CE, we know arc CE = 2 * ∠D = 2 * 50° = 100°.

3. **Finding the Measure of ∠C:**
   - ∠C is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc DE. Since DE is parallel to OA, arc DE is equal to arc OA.
   - The entire circle has 360°, so arc OA = 360° - arc CE = 360° - 100° = 260°.
   - Therefore, ∠C = 1/2 * arc DE = 1/2 * 260° = 130°.

**Answer:** The degree of ∠C is 130°.

We are given a circle with center O and two tangents PA and PB. Points C and D move along these tangents, and CD is always tangent to the circle. We need to find the perimeter of triangle PCD when PA = 8.

**Step 2: Identify key properties**

* **Tangents from a point:**  Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.
* **Tangent-radius property:** A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means angles OAC and OBD are right angles.

**Step 3: Analyze the triangle**

* **Right triangles:** Triangles OAC and OBD are right-angled triangles.
* **Equal sides:** Since PA = PB, and OA and OB are radii of the same circle, we have OA = OB. Therefore, triangles OAC and OBD are congruent (by the Hypotenuse-Leg congruence theorem).
* **Perimeter:** The perimeter of triangle PCD is PC + CD + PD.

**Step 4: Solve for the perimeter**

* **PC and PD:** Since triangles OAC and OBD are congruent, we have AC = BD. Therefore, PC + PD = PA + PB = 8 + 8 = 16.
* **CD:** CD is the length of the tangent segment. Since tangents from a point are equal, CD = AC = BD.

94,如图，D为△ABC内一点，CD平分∠ACB，BD⊥CD，∠A＝∠ABD，若∠DBC＝54°，则∠A的度数为（）,27°,"**Step 1: Find the measure of angle ACB.**

Since CD bisects angle ACB, we know that angle ACD is equal to angle BCD.  We are given that angle DBC is 54 degrees.  Since BD is perpendicular to CD, angle BDC is 90 degrees.  Therefore, angle BCD is 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 54 degrees = 36 degrees.  Since angle ACD is equal to angle BCD, angle ACD is also 36 degrees.  Therefore, angle ACB is 36 degrees + 36 degrees = 72 degrees.

**Step 2: Find the measure of angle ABD.**

We are given that angle A is equal to angle ABD.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we know that angle ABD + angle ADB + angle BAD = 180 degrees.  We know that angle ADB is 90 degrees (since BD is perpendicular to CD).  Therefore, angle ABD + 90 degrees + angle BAD = 180 degrees.  Since angle A is equal to angle ABD, we can substitute angle A for angle ABD in this equation.  This gives us angle A + 90 degrees + angle A = 180 degrees.  Simplifying this equation, we get 2 * angle A + 90 degrees = 180 degrees.  Subtracting 90 degrees from both sides, we get 2 * angle A = 90 degrees.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get angle A = 45 degrees.  Since angle A is equal to angle ABD, angle ABD is also 45 degrees.

**Step 3: Find the measure of angle ABC.**

We know that angle ABC is equal to angle ABD + angle DBC.  We know that angle ABD is 45 degrees and angle DBC is 54 degrees.  Therefore, angle ABC is 45 degrees + 54 degrees = 99 degrees.

**Step 4: Find the measure of angle A.**

We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle A + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180 degrees.  We know that angle ABC is 99 degrees and angle ACB is 72 degrees.  Therefore, angle A + 99 degrees + 72 degrees = 180 degrees.  Simplifying this equation, we get angle A + 171 degrees = 180 degrees.  Subtracting 171 degrees from both sides, we get angle A = 9 degrees.

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

1. **Understanding Medians:** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. In this case, AD is a median because D is the midpoint of BC.

2. **Area Relationship:**  The median of a triangle divides the triangle into two triangles with equal areas. This means the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD.

3. **Area of Triangle ABD:** Since E is the midpoint of AD, line segment AE is half the length of AD.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABE is half the area of triangle ABD.  We know the area of triangle ABE is 2, so the area of triangle ABD is 2 * 2 = 4.

4. **Area of Triangle ABC:**  Since the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD, the area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of these two triangles: 4 + 4 = 8.

   - We know that DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, meaning it cuts AB in half and forms a right angle at D.
   - We are given the perimeter of triangle ACE, which is the sum of its sides: AC + CE + AE = 13.

* **Parallelogram Properties:** Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel. Opposite angles are equal. Diagonals bisect each other.
* **Angle Bisector Property:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.

* Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD = 3 and BC = AD = 4.
* Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, ∠ABE = ∠CBE.
* Since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

**Step 3: Use the angle bisector property to find the angles.**

* In triangle ABE, ∠ABE = ∠CBE and AB = BE (since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC). Therefore, triangle ABE is an isosceles triangle, and AE = BE.
* Similarly, in triangle DCF, ∠BCF = ∠DCF and CD = CF (since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD). Therefore, triangle DCF is an isosceles triangle, and DF = CF.

1. **Understanding the problem:** We are given a diagram with intersecting lines AB and CD. We know that line OD bisects angle AOE, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts. We also know that angle BOC is 50 degrees. Our goal is to find the measure of angle EOB.

2. **Using the concept of bisectors:** Since OD bisects angle AOE, we can say that angle AOD is equal to angle DOE.

3. **Finding the relationship between angles:**  Notice that angles AOD and DOE together make up angle AOE. Also, angles AOE and EOB together make up a straight angle (180 degrees).

   * Similarly, since ∠CPD intercepts arc CD, which has a central angle of 50 degrees, we have ∠CPD = 50/2 = 25 degrees.

3. **Finding ∠P:**  We can find ∠P by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.

We are given a triangle ABC with two angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. We know that angle A is 110 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle BOC.

**Step 2: Use the angle bisector theorem**

The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.

**Step 3: Apply the theorem to our problem**

Since OB is the angle bisector of angle B, we can apply the angle bisector theorem to triangle ABO. This means that:

BO/AO = BC/AC

Similarly, since OC is the angle bisector of angle C, we can apply the angle bisector theorem to triangle ACO. This means that:

CO/AO = BC/AB

**Step 4: Combine the equations**

We can combine the two equations above to get:

BO/AO * CO/AO = (BC/AC) * (BC/AB)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

BO * CO = BC^2 / (AC * AB)

**Step 5: Use the angle sum property of triangles**

The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Applying this to triangle ABC, we get:

∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°

Substituting ∠A = 110°, we get:

∠B + ∠C = 70°

**Step 6: Use the angle bisector property**

Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, we know that:

∠ABO = ∠CBO and ∠ACO = ∠BCO

∠B = 2 * ∠ABO and ∠C = 2 * ∠ACO

Substituting these values into the equation from step 5, we get:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We have a quadrilateral ABCD with specific angle measurements. We need to find a point M on BC and a point N on CD such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized. Then, we need to find the sum of angles AMN and ANM.

2. **Key Insight:** The perimeter of a triangle is minimized when the sum of the lengths of two sides is equal to the length of the third side. This happens when the two sides collapse into a single line segment.

3. **Applying the Insight:** To minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, we need to make AM and AN collapse into a single line segment. This means that point M should coincide with point B, and point N should coincide with point D.

4. **Finding the Angles:** Now, triangle AMN becomes triangle ABD. Since ∠BAD = 120° and ∠B = ∠D = 90°, we can find ∠ABD and ∠ADB:

   * ∠ABD = 180° - ∠BAD - ∠ADB = 180° - 120° - 90° = -30°
   * ∠ADB = 180° - ∠BAD - ∠ABD = 180° - 120° - 90° = -30°

   * ∠ABD = 360° - 30° = 330°

and $m \angle WZG=20,$ find $m \angle YIZ$",50,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a diagram with a triangle and a line intersecting it. We need to find the measure of angle YIZ. We are given some angle measures and a proportion involving the sides of the triangle.

2. **Using the Proportion:** The proportion  $\frac{IJ}{XJ}=\frac{HJ}{YJ}$ tells us that triangle JXY is similar to triangle JIH. This means their corresponding angles are equal.

3. **Finding Angle JXY:**  Since angle WXJ is 130 degrees, and angles WXJ and JXY are supplementary (they add up to 180 degrees), we can find angle JXY: 
   *  m∠JXY = 180° - 130° = 50°

4. **Finding Angle JIH:** Since triangles JXY and JIH are similar, angle JIH is equal to angle JXY:
   * m∠JIH = m∠JXY = 50°

5. **Finding Angle YIZ:**  We know that angle WZG is 20 degrees, and angles WZG and YIZ are vertical angles (they share the same vertex and are opposite each other). Vertical angles are equal:
   * m∠YIZ = m∠WZG = 20°

228,"As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of circle O, DB and DC are respectively tangent to circle O at points B and C. If ∠ACE = 25.0, then the degree of ∠D is ()",50°,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understanding Tangents:**  A tangent line to a circle touches the circle at exactly one point. The radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. Therefore, ∠OBC = 90° and ∠OCD = 90°.

2. **Angles in a Triangle:** The angles inside a triangle always add up to 180°.  In triangle OBC, we have:
   ∠OBC + ∠BCO + ∠COB = 180°
   90° + ∠BCO + ∠COB = 180°
   ∠BCO + ∠COB = 90°

3. **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle (an angle formed by two chords with its vertex on the circle) is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Since AB is a diameter, arc ACB is a semicircle, and ∠ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting this semicircle. Therefore, ∠ACB = 1/2 * 180° = 90°.

4. **Angle Relationships:**  ∠ACE and ∠BCO are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°) because they form a straight line. Therefore:
   ∠ACE + ∠BCO = 180°
   25° + ∠BCO = 180°
   ∠BCO = 155°

5. **Finding ∠COB:**  We know ∠BCO + ∠COB = 90°.  Substituting the value of ∠BCO, we get:
   155° + ∠COB = 90°
   ∠COB = -65°

6. **Angle D:**  ∠D is an exterior angle of triangle OCD.  An exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore:
   ∠D = ∠OCD + ∠COB
   ∠D = 90° + (-65°)

1. **Identify the sides:** A parallelogram has two pairs of parallel sides. We know one side is 23 ft long. The opposite side is also 23 ft long.

2. **Find the missing side:** We need to find the length of the other two sides.  Notice that the dashed line creates a right triangle. We know one angle is 60 degrees, and the side opposite that angle is 23 ft.  We can use trigonometry (specifically the sine function) to find the length of the dashed line (which is the height of the parallelogram):

   * sin(60°) = opposite side / hypotenuse
   * sin(60°) = 23 ft / hypotenuse
   * hypotenuse = 23 ft / sin(60°) 
   * hypotenuse ≈ 26.5 ft

1. **Understanding the given information:**
   - We are given that F is the intersection of the angle bisectors CD and BE of triangle ABC.
   - We are also given that CG is perpendicular to AB, and angle ACG is 32 degrees.

2. **Using the angle bisector property:**
   - Since CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB, we know that angle ACD is equal to angle BCD.
   - Similarly, since BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, we know that angle ABE is equal to angle CBE.

3. **Finding angles in triangle ACG:**
   - We know that angle ACG is 32 degrees.
   - Since CG is perpendicular to AB, angle AGC is 90 degrees.
   - The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, so angle CAG = 180 - 90 - 32 = 58 degrees.

4. **Finding angles in triangle BFC:**
   - We know that angle BFC is the angle we are looking for.
   - Angle BFC is the sum of angles BFD and DFC.
   - Angle BFD is equal to angle ABE (because BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC).
   - Angle DFC is equal to angle ACD (because CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB).

5. **Putting it all together:**
   - We know that angle ABE + angle CBE = angle ABC.
   - We also know that angle ACD + angle BCD = angle ACB.
   - Therefore, angle BFD + angle DFC = (angle ABE + angle CBE) + (angle ACD + angle BCD) = angle ABC + angle ACB.
   - Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, angle ABC + angle ACB = 180 - angle BAC.
   - Therefore, angle BFC = 180 - angle BAC.

6. **Finding angle BAC:**
   - We know that angle CAG = 58 degrees.
   - Since angle BAC is the sum of angles BAG and CAG, we know that angle BAC = angle BAG + 58 degrees.
   - We don't know the value of angle BAG, but we can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find it.
   - In triangle BAG, angle BAG + angle ABG + angle AGB = 180 degrees.
   - We know that angle AGB = 90 degrees (because CG is perpendicular to AB).
   - We also know that angle ABG = angle ABE (because BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC).
