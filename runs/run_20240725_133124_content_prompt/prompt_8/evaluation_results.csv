643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"**1. Problem:**

The problem involves a circle with center O, diameter CD, and chords DE and OA. We are given that DE is parallel to OA and that the measure of angle D is 50 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle C.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**

   * Since CD is a diameter, angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.
   * Because DE is parallel to OA, angle D and angle A are corresponding angles and therefore congruent. So, angle A also measures 50 degrees.
   * Angle COA is the sum of angles A and D, which is 50 degrees + 50 degrees = 100 degrees.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

   * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * Angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AD.
   * Angle COA is a central angle that intercepts the same arc AD.

* **Step 3: Calculate the measure of angle C.**

   * Since angle COA is a central angle, its measure is equal to the measure of arc AD. Therefore, arc AD measures 100 degrees.
   * Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of angle C is half the measure of arc AD, which is 100 degrees / 2 = 50 degrees.

The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees. The side opposite the 60-degree angle has a length of 4, and the hypotenuse has a length of *h*. The problem asks us to find the value of *h*.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio.**
    * We know the length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle (4) and we want to find the length of the hypotenuse (*h*). 
    * The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function: sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse.

The image shows two intersecting lines AB and CD, with point O as their intersection. Ray OE bisects angle BOC. Given that angle AOD is 70 degrees, we need to find the measure of angle AOE.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles.**
    * We know that angle AOD is 70 degrees.
    * Since angles AOD and DOC are supplementary (they form a straight line), we can find angle DOC: 
        * Angle DOC = 180 degrees - angle AOD = 180 degrees - 70 degrees = 110 degrees.
    * Ray OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides angle BOC into two equal angles.

* **Step 2: Apply the angle bisector property.**
    * Since OE bisects angle BOC, we have:
        * Angle BOE = angle COE = (1/2) * angle BOC.

* **Step 3: Find angle BOC.**
    * Angle BOC and angle DOC are supplementary angles. Therefore:
        * Angle BOC = 180 degrees - angle DOC = 180 degrees - 110 degrees = 70 degrees.

* **Step 4: Calculate angle AOE.**
    * Angle AOE is the sum of angles AOB and BOE.
    * Angle AOB is a straight angle, so it measures 180 degrees.
    * Angle BOE is half of angle BOC, so it measures (1/2) * 70 degrees = 35 degrees.
    * Therefore, angle AOE = angle AOB + angle BOE = 180 degrees + 35 degrees = 215 degrees.

Four charged particles are arranged at the corners of a square. The charges are as follows:

* q1 = -100 nC
* q2 = 100 nC
* q3 = -200 nC
* q4 = 200 nC

The side length of the square is a = 5.0 cm. The problem asks for the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.

**2. Solution:**

**Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**

Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to the other three particles:

* **Force due to q1:** This force is attractive (opposite charges) and acts along the diagonal of the square.
* **Force due to q2:** This force is repulsive (same charges) and acts horizontally to the right.
* **Force due to q4:** This force is repulsive (same charges) and acts vertically downwards.

**Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of each force.**

We can use Coulomb's Law to calculate the magnitude of each force:

* F = k * |q1 * q3| / r^2

where:

* k is Coulomb's constant (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
* q1 and q3 are the magnitudes of the charges
* r is the distance between the charges

* **Force due to q1:**
    * r = a * sqrt(2) (diagonal of the square)
    * F13 = k * |q1 * q3| / (a * sqrt(2))^2
* **Force due to q2:**
    * r = a
    * F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / a^2
* **Force due to q4:**
    * r = a
    * F43 = k * |q4 * q3| / a^2

**Step 3: Resolve each force into its x and y components.**

* **Force due to q1:**
    * x-component: F13x = F13 * cos(45°)
    * y-component: F13y = F13 * sin(45°)
* **Force due to q2:**
    * x-component: F23x = F23
    * y-component: F23y = 0
* **Force due to q4:**
    * x-component: F43x = 0
    * y-component: F43y = F43

**Step 4: Sum the x-components of all forces.**

The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is:

* Fnetx = F13x + F23x + F43x

**Step 5: Substitute the values and calculate the final answer.**

* Fnetx = (k * |q1 * q3| / (a * sqrt(2))^2) * cos(45°) + (k * |q2 * q3| / a^2) + 0
* Fnetx = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2 * 100 × 10^-9 C * 200 × 10^-9 C / (0.05 m * sqrt(2))^2) * cos(45°) + (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2 * 100 × 10^-9 C * 200 × 10^-9 C / (0.05 m)^2)
* Fnetx ≈ 0.127 N

    * Angles 1 and 14 are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal intersects two parallel lines. They occupy the same relative position at each intersection.

* **Step 2: Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate.**
    * The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then corresponding angles are congruent (have the same measure).

The image shows a 4x4 square grid with each small square having a side length of 1 unit. Points A, B, and C are located at grid points. Line segment AD is perpendicular to line segment BC, intersecting at point D. The problem asks to find the length of AD.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant triangles.**
   * We can see two right triangles in the diagram: triangle ABC and triangle ABD.

* **Step 2: Determine the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC.**
   * Using the grid, we can count the units to find the lengths of the sides:
      * AB = 4 units (vertical distance)
      * BC = 3 units (horizontal distance)

* **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ABC.**
   * The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   * In triangle ABC, AC is the hypotenuse. Therefore:
      * AC² = AB² + BC²
      * AC² = 4² + 3²
      * AC² = 16 + 9
      * AC² = 25
      * AC = √25 = 5 units

* **Step 4: Determine the length of BD.**
   * Since AD is perpendicular to BC, triangle ABD is also a right triangle.
   * We know AB = 4 units and AC = 5 units.
   * Using the Pythagorean theorem again:
      * BD² = AC² - AD²
      * BD² = 5² - 4²
      * BD² = 25 - 16
      * BD² = 9
      * BD = √9 = 3 units

* **Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ABD.**
   * We know AB = 4 units and BD = 3 units.
   * Using the Pythagorean theorem:
      * AD² = AB² - BD²
      * AD² = 4² - 3²

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand Tangent Properties**

   * **Tangent-Radius Property:** A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°.

   * **Equal Tangent Lengths:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, AC = AD and BC = BD.

* **Step 2: Analyze Triangle Properties**

   * **Perimeter of Triangle PCD:** The perimeter of triangle PCD is PC + CD + PD.

   * **Using Tangent Properties:** We can rewrite the perimeter as (PA - AC) + CD + (PB - BD).

   * **Simplifying:** Since AC = AD and BC = BD, the perimeter becomes PA + CD + PB - 2AC.

* **Step 3: Finding CD**

   * **Right Triangles:** Triangles OAC and OBD are right-angled triangles.

   * **Pythagorean Theorem:** Applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle OAC, we get: OA² + AC² = PA².

   * **Solving for AC:** Since OA is the radius of the circle and PA is given as 8.0, we can solve for AC.

   * **CD:** CD is the sum of the two tangents drawn from point C to the circle. Therefore, CD = 2AC.

* **Step 4: Calculating the Perimeter**

   * **Substitute Values:** Substitute the values of PA, CD, and AC into the perimeter formula: 8.0 + 2AC + 8.0 - 2AC.

* **Step 2:** Find angle BCD.
    * Since angle DBC is 54 degrees and angle BDC is 90 degrees, we can use the angle sum property of a triangle:
        * angle BCD + angle DBC + angle BDC = 180 degrees
        * angle BCD + 54 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Incenter**
    * The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. It is also the center of the triangle's inscribed circle.
    * An important property of the incenter is that it is equidistant from the sides of the triangle. This means $QN = QP = QM$.

* **Step 2: Use the Incenter Property**
    * Since $QM = 9$, we know that $QN = QP = 9$.

* **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
    * Triangle $JQP$ is a right triangle with right angle at $P$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $JQ$:
        * $JQ^2 = JP^2 + QP^2$
    * We know $QP = 9$. To find $JP$, we need to consider triangle $JLP$.

* **Step 4: Find JP**
    * Triangle $JLP$ is also a right triangle with right angle at $P$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem again:
        * $JL^2 = JP^2 + LP^2$
    * We know $JL = 16.5$. To find $LP$, we need to consider triangle $LMQ$.

* **Step 5: Find LP**
    * Triangle $LMQ$ is a right triangle with right angle at $M$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem once more:
        * $LQ^2 = LM^2 + QM^2$
    * We know $QM = 9$. To find $LM$, we need to consider the fact that $LM = LP + PM$. Since $PM = QP = 9$, we have $LM = LP + 9$.

* **Step 6: Solve for LP**
    * Substitute $LM = LP + 9$ into the equation for triangle $LMQ$:
        * $LQ^2 = (LP + 9)^2 + 9^2$
    * We need to find $LQ$. Since $LQ$ is the hypotenuse of triangle $JLQ$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem again:
        * $LQ^2 = JL^2 + JQ^2$
    * We know $JL = 16.5$. We can substitute this and the equation for $LQ^2$ from triangle $LMQ$ into the equation for triangle $JLQ$:
        * $(LP + 9)^2 + 9^2 = 16.5^2 + JQ^2$
    * Now we have an equation with two unknowns, $LP$ and $JQ$. We can solve for $LP$ by substituting the equation for $JQ^2$ from triangle $JQP$:
        * $(LP + 9)^2 + 9^2 = 16.5^2 + (JP^2 + 9^2)$
    * We can simplify this equation and solve for $LP$.

* **Step 7: Solve for JP**
    * Once we have found $LP$, we can substitute it into the equation for triangle $JLP$ to find $JP$.

* **Step 8: Solve for JQ**

**2. Solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze the properties of angle bisectors.**

* The angle bisector of an angle divides the opposite side of the triangle proportionally.

**Step 2: Apply the angle bisector theorem to triangles ABE and CDE.**

* In triangle ABE, BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC. Therefore, AE/ED = AB/BD.
* In triangle CDE, CE is the angle bisector of ∠BCD. Therefore, AE/ED = CD/BD.

**Step 3: Combine the equations from Step 2.**

The image shows two straight lines AB and CD intersecting at point O. Line OD bisects ∠AOE, and ∠BOC is given as 50 degrees. The problem asks to find the measure of ∠EOB.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the concept of angle bisector.**
   * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we have ∠AOD = ∠DOE.

* **Step 2: Identify the relevant angles.**
   * We are given ∠BOC = 50 degrees.
   * We need to find ∠EOB.
   * Notice that ∠AOD and ∠DOE together form ∠AOE.
   * Also, ∠EOB and ∠BOC together form ∠EOC.

* **Step 3: Apply the concept of supplementary angles.**
   * ∠AOE and ∠EOC are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠AOE + ∠EOC = 180 degrees.

* **Step 4: Use the given information and the angle bisector property.**
   * Since ∠AOD = ∠DOE, we can write ∠AOE = 2 * ∠AOD.
   * We also know ∠EOC = ∠EOB + ∠BOC.

* **Step 5: Substitute the values and solve for ∠EOB.**
   * Substituting the values in the equation from Step 3, we get:
      * 2 * ∠AOD + (∠EOB + 50) = 180
   * Simplifying the equation:
      * 2 * ∠AOD + ∠EOB = 130
   * Since ∠AOD and ∠DOE are equal, and they form ∠AOE, we have:
      * ∠AOE = 2 * ∠AOD = 2 * ∠DOE
   * Therefore, ∠AOE = 2 * (∠AOD + ∠DOE) = 2 * ∠AOE
   * This implies ∠AOE = 0 degrees.

A square is inscribed in a circle with an area of 18π square units. We need to find the length of one side of the square.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Find the radius of the circle.**
   * The area of a circle is given by the formula: Area = πr², where r is the radius.
   * We know the area is 18π, so we can set up the equation: 18π = πr²

The problem involves a triangle ABC with point N being the midpoint of side BC. AM bisects angle BAC, and BM is perpendicular to AM at point M. Given that AB = 8 and MN = 2, the problem asks to find the length of AC.

**2. Solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze the given information and identify relevant geometric properties.**

* N is the midpoint of BC, meaning BN = NC.
* AM bisects angle BAC, meaning angle BAM = angle MAC.
* BM is perpendicular to AM, forming a right angle at M.

**Step 2: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem.**

The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides. In triangle ABC, AM bisects angle BAC, so:

**Step 3: Utilize the Pythagorean Theorem.**

In right triangle BMN, we can apply the Pythagorean Theorem:

**Step 4: Express BN in terms of BC.**

Since N is the midpoint of BC, BN = BC/2.

**Step 5: Substitute and solve for BM.**

Substitute BN = BC/2 into the Pythagorean Theorem equation:

BM² + 2² = (BC/2)²

BM² = (BC²/4) - 4

**Step 6: Express MC in terms of BC.**

MC = BC - BN = BC - (BC/2) = BC/2

**Step 7: Substitute BM and MC into the Angle Bisector Theorem equation.**

The problem involves a circle with center O, diameter AC, and tangents PA and PB drawn from an external point P. The angle ∠P is given as 50 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle ∠ACB.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant properties**

   * **Tangents from a point:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB.
   * **Angle between tangent and radius:** The angle between a tangent and the radius drawn to the point of tangency is always 90 degrees. So, ∠OAP = ∠OBP = 90 degrees.
   * **Angles in a triangle:** The sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.

* **Step 2: Analyze triangle PAB**

   * Since PA = PB and ∠OAP = ∠OBP = 90 degrees, triangle PAB is an isosceles right triangle.
   * Therefore, ∠PAB = ∠PBA = (180 - ∠P) / 2 = (180 - 50) / 2 = 65 degrees.

* **Step 3: Analyze triangle OAB**

   * ∠OAB = ∠OBA = 90 - ∠PAB = 90 - 65 = 25 degrees.
   * ∠AOB = 180 - ∠OAB - ∠OBA = 180 - 25 - 25 = 130 degrees.

* **Step 4: Determine ∠ACB**

   * Since AC is the diameter, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle subtending the diameter, making it a right angle (90 degrees).
   * ∠ACB = 180 - ∠ABC - ∠CAB = 180 - 90 - 25 = **65 degrees**.

Squares are drawn on each side of the triangle, with the squares corresponding to the sides of length 8 and 14 having areas of 64 and 196, respectively. The problem asks for the area of the square drawn on the unknown side, labeled ""A"".

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Relationship between Squares and Sides**
   * The area of a square is equal to the side length squared.  This means if we know the area of a square, we can find its side length by taking the square root of the area.

* **Step 2: Find the Side Lengths of the Known Squares**
   * The square with an area of 64 has a side length of √64 = 8.
   * The square with an area of 196 has a side length of √196 = 14.

The image shows a circle with center O and radius 2. Points A, B, and C lie on the circle. Angle C is 30 degrees. The problem asks for the length of chord AB.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Draw a diameter through point C.**
   * Since angle C is 30 degrees, the central angle subtended by chord AC is 60 degrees (twice the inscribed angle).
   * This means triangle AOC is a 30-60-90 triangle.

* **Step 2: Determine the lengths of the sides of triangle AOC.**
   * In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is √3 times the length of the shorter leg.
   * Since the hypotenuse is the radius of the circle (2), the shorter leg (OC) is 1, and the longer leg (AC) is √3.

* **Step 3: Find the length of chord AB.**
   * Chord AB is the base of isosceles triangle AOB, where OA and OB are radii of the circle.
   * Since triangle AOC is a 30-60-90 triangle, angle AOB is 120 degrees (180 - 60).
   * We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of AB:

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Analyze the Rotations and Angles**
    * Rotating triangle ABC 90 degrees clockwise around point A means that angle BAC (originally 90 degrees) becomes angle B'AC' (also 90 degrees).

* **Step 1: Identify the central angle.**
    * A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. In this case, the central angle is the angle formed by two radii of the circle, such as angle AKB.

* **Step 2: Understand the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle.**
    * An inscribed angle is an angle whose vertex lies on the circle and whose sides are chords of the circle. In this case, angle ADB is an inscribed angle.
    * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Step 3: Determine the measure of the intercepted arc.**
    * The intercepted arc of angle ADB is arc AB. Since square ABDC is inscribed in the circle, arc AB is one-fourth of the circumference of the circle.
    * The measure of a full circle is 360 degrees, so arc AB measures 360/4 = 90 degrees.

* **Step 4: Calculate the measure of the central angle.**
    * Since angle ADB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AB, its measure is half the measure of arc AB. Therefore, angle ADB measures 90/2 = 45 degrees.

The length of the diameter is 24, and the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle are 9 and 12.25. We need to find the value of x, which represents the length of one of the sides of the triangle.

   The problem involves a triangle inscribed in a circle, where one side of the triangle is the diameter of the circle. This scenario relates to a key geometric principle: **If a triangle is inscribed in a circle, and one side of the triangle is the diameter of the circle, then the triangle is a right triangle, and the diameter is the hypotenuse.**

* **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem.**

   Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side length (x). The Pythagorean theorem states:  a² + b² = c², where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs of the right triangle, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.

* **Step 3: Substitute the known values into the Pythagorean theorem.**

   We know:

    * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem to angle ACB.**
    * Angle ACB intercepts arc AB.
    * Therefore, the measure of arc AB is twice the measure of angle ACB, which is 2 * 25 degrees = 50 degrees.

* **Step 3: Apply the Central Angle Theorem to angle AOB.**
    * Angle AOB is a central angle that intercepts arc AB.
    * Therefore, the measure of angle AOB is equal to the measure of arc AB, which is 50 degrees.

* **Step 4: Determine the measure of angle BAO.**
    * Angle BAO is part of triangle ABO.
    * The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

The problem involves a circle with center O and diameter AB. Point D lies on the extension of line AB, and line CD is tangent to the circle at point C. Given that angle A is 25 degrees, we need to find the measure of angle D.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant geometric relationships.**
    * Since CD is tangent to the circle at C, angle OCB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because the radius of a circle is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency.
    * Angle AOB is a straight angle (180 degrees) because AB is the diameter of the circle.

* **Step 2: Apply angle properties.**
    * In triangle AOB, we have: ∠AOB = 180° - ∠A = 180° - 25° = 155°.
    * In triangle COB, we have: ∠COB = 180° - ∠OCB - ∠BOC = 180° - 90° - ∠BOC = 90° - ∠BOC.
    * Since ∠AOB = ∠COB + ∠COA, we have: 155° = (90° - ∠BOC) + ∠COA.
    * Therefore, ∠COA = 65° + ∠BOC.

* **Step 3: Apply the tangent-chord angle theorem.**
    * The tangent-chord angle theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
    * In our case, angle D is formed by tangent CD and chord AC. Therefore, ∠D = 1/2 * ∠COA.

* **Step 4: Calculate angle D.**
    * We know ∠COA = 65° + ∠BOC. Since ∠BOC is an angle within triangle COB, it must be less than 90°. Therefore, ∠COA is greater than 65°.

**2. Solution:**

**Step 1: Constructing a Reflection**

* Reflect point A across line BC to obtain point A'.
* Reflect point A across line CD to obtain point A''.

**Step 2: Understanding the Geometry**

* Since ∠B = ∠D = 90°, we know that BA' = BA and DA'' = DA.
* The perimeter of triangle AMN is equal to the sum of AM + MN + NA.
* By the reflection property, AM = A'M and AN = A''N.
* Therefore, the perimeter of triangle AMN is equal to A'M + MN + A''N.

**Step 3: Minimizing the Perimeter**

* The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
* Therefore, the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized when A'M + MN + A''N is a straight line.
* This occurs when points A', M, N, and A'' are collinear.

**Step 4: Finding the Angles**

* Since A'M and A''N are straight lines, ∠A'MN = 180° and ∠A''NM = 180°.

The image shows a diagram with two triangles, ABC and DEF, which are congruent. CD bisects angle BCA. Given that angle A is 22 degrees and angle CGF is 88 degrees, the problem asks to find the measure of angle E.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify congruent angles.**
    * Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle A = angle D = 22 degrees.

* **Step 2: Find angle BCD.**
    * CD bisects angle BCA, meaning angle BCD = angle ACD = (1/2) * angle BCA.
    * Since angle A = 22 degrees and angle A + angle BCA = 180 degrees (angles on a straight line), we have angle BCA = 180 - 22 = 158 degrees.
    * Therefore, angle BCD = angle ACD = (1/2) * 158 = 79 degrees.

* **Step 3: Find angle DCG.**
    * Angle DCG is supplementary to angle CGF, meaning angle DCG + angle CGF = 180 degrees.
    * Therefore, angle DCG = 180 - 88 = 92 degrees.

* **Step 4: Find angle GCD.**
    * Angle GCD is part of triangle GCD. We know angle DCG = 92 degrees and angle GDC = angle A = 22 degrees.
    * Using the angle sum property of triangles, angle GCD + angle DCG + angle GDC = 180 degrees.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
    *  Angle BCD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BD.
    *  Angle AOD is a central angle that also intercepts arc BD.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
    * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. 
    * Therefore,  ∠BCD = 1/2 * measure of arc BD.

* **Step 3: Apply the Central Angle Theorem.**
    * The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * Therefore, ∠AOD = measure of arc BD.

* **Step 4: Combine the theorems to find ∠AOD.**

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand Symmetry**
   * Symmetry means that the points are mirrored across the line.  This implies that the line bisects the segment connecting the two symmetrical points, and the angles formed by the line and the segment are equal.

* **Step 2: Apply Symmetry to Angles**
   * Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, we have ∠AMP = ∠BMP.
   * Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, we have ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.

* **Step 3: Analyze Triangle AMP**
   * In triangle AMP, we have ∠AMP + ∠MAP + ∠MPA = 180 degrees (angle sum property of a triangle).
   * Since ∠AMP = ∠BMP, we can write ∠BMP + ∠MAP + ∠MPA = 180 degrees.

* **Step 4: Analyze Triangle ANQ**
   * Similarly, in triangle ANQ, we have ∠ANQ + ∠NAQ + ∠NQA = 180 degrees.
   * Since ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ, we can write ∠CNQ + ∠NAQ + ∠NQA = 180 degrees.

* **Step 5: Combine Information**
   * We know ∠BAC = ∠MAP + ∠NAQ = 110 degrees.
   * Adding the equations from steps 3 and 4, we get:
     ∠BMP + ∠MAP + ∠MPA + ∠CNQ + ∠NAQ + ∠NQA = 360 degrees.
   * Rearranging, we get:

The problem presents an infinite chain of resistors, each with a resistance of R = 1 ohm, connected in a specific pattern. The task is to determine the equivalent resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b'.

**2. Solution:**

1. **Symmetry and Simplification:** Due to the infinite nature of the chain, the resistance between 'a' and 'b' will be the same as the resistance between any two adjacent nodes in the chain. Let's focus on the first three resistors.

2. **Series and Parallel Combinations:**
   * The two resistors on the top and bottom, connected in parallel, have an equivalent resistance of R/2 (1/R + 1/R = 2/R, so R/2).
   * This equivalent resistance is in series with the resistor in the middle, resulting in a total resistance of R/2 + R = 3R/2.

3. **Recursive Relationship:** Now, consider the rest of the infinite chain. The resistance between 'b' and the next node is the same as the original resistance between 'a' and 'b'. Let's call this resistance 'x'.

4. **Equation:** The total resistance between 'a' and 'b' can be expressed as:
   * x = 3R/2 + 1/(1/x + 1/R)

5. **Solving for x:**
   * Simplify the equation: x = 3R/2 + xR/(x+R)
   * Multiply both sides by (x+R): x(x+R) = 3R(x+R)/2 + xR
   * Expand and rearrange: x^2 + xR - 3Rx/2 - 3R^2/2 - xR = 0
   * Simplify: x^2 - 3Rx/2 - 3R^2/2 = 0

6. **Quadratic Formula:** Solve the quadratic equation for x using the quadratic formula:
   * x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
   * Where a = 1, b = -3R/2, and c = -3R^2/2

7. **Solution:**
   * x = (3R/2 ± √((-3R/2)^2 - 4 * 1 * -3R^2/2)) / 2 * 1
   * x = (3R/2 ± √(9R^2/4 + 6R^2)) / 2
   * x = (3R/2 ± √(33R^2/4)) / 2
   * x = (3R/2 ± (R√33)/2) / 2
   * Since resistance cannot be negative, we take the positive solution: x = (3R + R√33) / 4

**3. Answer:**

Substituting R = 1 ohm into the solution:
* x = (3 * 1 + 1 * √33) / 4
* x = (3 + √33) / 4 ohms

Therefore, the resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is **(3 + √33) / 4 ohms**.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between angles in a circle.**
    * The angles around a point add up to 360°.  This means that the sum of the four angles at point C is 360°.

* **Step 2: Set up an equation.**
    * We can write the equation: (x - 1)° + (3x + 5)° + 60° + ∠NCL = 360°

The image shows a regular hexagon ABCDEF with point O as its center.  Angle ABO is labeled as x degrees. We need to find the value of x.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1:  Find the measure of each interior angle of the hexagon.**
   * The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees.
   * For a hexagon (n=6), the sum of interior angles is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.
   * Since the hexagon is regular, all its interior angles are equal. Therefore, each interior angle measures 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.

* **Step 2:  Find the measure of angle AOB.**
   * Triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle (OA = OB, as they are radii of the hexagon).
   * The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
   * Therefore, angle AOB = 180 degrees - (angle OAB + angle OBA) = 180 degrees - (120 degrees / 2) = 180 degrees - 60 degrees = 120 degrees.

* **Step 3:  Find the value of x.**
   * Angle AOB is a central angle of the hexagon, and it intercepts arc AB.
   * The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * Since ABCDEF is a regular hexagon, arc AB is 1/6 of the entire circumference of the hexagon.
   * Therefore, the measure of arc AB is (1/6) * 360 degrees = 60 degrees.

   * The theorem we need is the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Step 2: Apply the theorem to the given angles.**
   * Angle DCE intercepts arc DE.  Therefore, the measure of arc DE is 2 * (5x - 12) degrees.
   * Angle DEC intercepts arc DC.  Therefore, the measure of arc DC is 2 * 3x degrees.

* **Step 3: Use the fact that the measures of the arcs of a circle add up to 360 degrees.**
   * The measure of arc DE plus the measure of arc DC equals 360 degrees.

The problem involves a circle with diameter AB, where DB and DC are tangents to the circle at points B and C respectively. Given that ∠ACE = 25.0 degrees, we need to find the measure of ∠D.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**

   * Since DB and DC are tangents to the circle, we know that ∠DBO and ∠DCO are right angles (90 degrees). This is because a tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
   * ∠ABO is also a right angle because AB is the diameter of the circle.
   * ∠ACE and ∠ACB are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees) because they form a straight line.

* **Step 2: Calculate ∠ACB.**

   * ∠ACE + ∠ACB = 180 degrees (supplementary angles)
   * 25.0 degrees + ∠ACB = 180 degrees
   * ∠ACB = 180 degrees - 25.0 degrees = 155 degrees

    * Since AB is a diameter, angle ACB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem: an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle).
    * Angle ADB is also a right angle (same reason as above).

* **Step 2: Apply angle properties of triangles.**
    * In triangle ABD, we know ∠ABD = 50° and ∠ADB = 90°.  Therefore, ∠BAD = 180° - 50° - 90° = 40°.

* **Step 3: Utilize the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.**
    * Angle BCD is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as central angle BOD.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.

* **Step 4: Calculate the central angle BOD.**

    * For a pentagon (n=5), the sum of the interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.

    * Triangle AEO is isosceles because OA = OE (radii of the circle).
    * Therefore, angles AEO and EAO are equal.
    * The sum of the angles in triangle AEO is 180 degrees.
    * Angle AOE is a central angle of the pentagon, which intercepts arc AE. Since the pentagon is regular, arc AE is 1/5 of the circumference of the circle, so angle AOE is 1/5 of 360 degrees = 72 degrees.
