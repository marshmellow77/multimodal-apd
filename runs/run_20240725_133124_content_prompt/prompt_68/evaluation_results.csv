643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. **Problem:** In a circle with center O, CD is the diameter, chord DE is parallel to chord OA, and the measure of angle D is 50 degrees. Find the measure of angle C.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant angles and relationships.
      * Since CD is a diameter, angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.
      * Since DE is parallel to OA, angle D and angle A are corresponding angles and therefore congruent. So, angle A also measures 50 degrees.
      * Angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as angle COD.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * Since angle COD intercepts the entire circle, its measure is 360 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle C, which intercepts the same arc, has a measure of half of 360 degrees.
   * **Step 3:** Calculate the measure of angle C.
      * Angle C = (1/2) * 360 degrees = 180 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the trigonometric ratio that relates the given information to the unknown side.
      * We know the length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle (4 units) and we want to find the length of the hypotenuse.
      * The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function:  sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse.
   * **Step 2:** Substitute the known values into the sine function.
      * sin(60°) = 4/h
   * **Step 3:** Solve for the unknown, h.
      * Multiply both sides of the equation by h: h * sin(60°) = 4
      * Divide both sides of the equation by sin(60°): h = 4 / sin(60°)
   * **Step 4:** Evaluate the sine function and simplify the expression.
      * sin(60°) = √3/2
      * h = 4 / (√3/2) = 8/√3
   * **Step 5:** Rationalize the denominator.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the key relationships.
      * Since PA and PB are tangents to the circle from the same external point, PA = PB.
      * Since CD is tangent to the circle at point E, OE is perpendicular to CD.

   * **Step 1:** Find the measure of angle BCD.
      * Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle BCD equals half of angle ACB.
      * Therefore, angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB.
   * **Step 2:** Find the measure of angle BDC.
      * Since BD is perpendicular to CD, angle BDC is a right angle.
      * Therefore, angle BDC = 90 degrees.
   * **Step 3:** Find the measure of angle CBD.
      * The sum of the angles in triangle BCD is 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle CBD = 180 degrees - angle BCD - angle BDC.
      * Substituting the values we found in steps 1 and 2, we get: angle CBD = 180 degrees - (1/2) * angle ACB - 90 degrees.
      * Simplifying, we get: angle CBD = 90 degrees - (1/2) * angle ACB.
   * **Step 4:** Find the measure of angle ABD.

      * We are given that angle A equals angle ABD.
      * Therefore, angle A = angle ABD = (1/2) * angle ACB.
   * **Step 6:** Find the measure of angle ACB.
      * The sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle ACB = 180 degrees - angle A - angle ABC.
      * Substituting the value we found in step 5, we get: angle ACB = 180 degrees - (1/2) * angle ACB - angle ABC.
      * Simplifying, we get: (3/2) * angle ACB = 180 degrees - angle ABC.
      * We are given that angle DBC = 54 degrees.
      * Since angle ABC is the sum of angles ABD and DBC, we have: angle ABC = angle ABD + angle DBC = (1/2) * angle ACB + 54 degrees.
      * Substituting this value into the equation for angle ACB, we get: (3/2) * angle ACB = 180 degrees - ((1/2) * angle ACB + 54 degrees).

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric concepts.
      * We are dealing with a right triangle and its midpoints.
      * The line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length. This is known as the Midpoint Theorem.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the Midpoint Theorem.
      * Since D and E are the midpoints of AC and AB respectively, DE is parallel to BC and DE = 1/2 BC.
   * **Step 3:** Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BC.
      * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
      * In triangle ABC, BC is the hypotenuse, so BC² = AB² - AC² = 13² - 5² = 144.
      * Therefore, BC = √144 = 12.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Draw a diagram and label the given information.
      * We are given that AB = 8, MN = 2, and N is the midpoint of BC. We also know that AM bisects angle BAC and BM is perpendicular to AM.
   * **Step 2:** Use the fact that N is the midpoint of BC to find the length of BN.
      * Since N is the midpoint of BC, BN = NC = BC/2.
   * **Step 3:** Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BM.
      * In right triangle BMN, we have BM² + MN² = BN².
      * Substituting the known values, we get BM² + 2² = BN².
      * Solving for BM, we get BM = √(BN² - 4).
   * **Step 4:** Use the Angle Bisector Theorem to find the ratio of AB to AC.
      * The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that a bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.
      * In triangle ABC, AM bisects angle BAC, so we have AB/AC = BM/MC.
   * **Step 5:** Use the fact that BM is perpendicular to AM to find the length of MC.
      * Since BM is perpendicular to AM, triangle BMC is a right triangle.
      * Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we have BM² + MC² = BC².
      * Substituting the known values, we get (√(BN² - 4))² + MC² = BC².
      * Solving for MC, we get MC = √(BC² - (BN² - 4)).
   * **Step 6:** Substitute the values of AB, BM, and MC into the equation AB/AC = BM/MC to solve for AC.
      * We have 8/AC = √(BN² - 4)/√(BC² - (BN² - 4)).
      * Solving for AC, we get AC = 8√(BC² - (BN² - 4))/√(BN² - 4).
   * **Step 7:** Substitute the value of BN in terms of BC to simplify the expression for AC.
      * We have BN = BC/2, so AC = 8√(BC² - ((BC/2)² - 4))/√((BC/2)² - 4).
   * **Step 8:** Simplify the expression for AC.
      * AC = 8√(BC² - (BC²/4 - 4))/√(BC²/4 - 4) = 8√(3BC²/4 + 4)/√(BC²/4 - 4) = 8√(3BC² + 16)/√(BC² - 16).

      * Substituting the given value, 20° = ∠DCG + ∠GCF.
   * **Step 3:** Utilize the fact that angles in a triangle sum to 180°.
      * In ΔDCG, ∠DCG + ∠CGE + ∠GCD = 180°.
      * Substituting known values, ∠DCG + 90° + ∠GCD = 180°.

      *  ∠D and ∠C are supplementary angles because they form a linear pair.
      *  ∠C is also the angle formed by a tangent line (CD) and a chord (BC) of the circle.

   * **Step 2:** Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * Since ∠A and ∠C intercept the same arc, BC, we have: ∠A = (1/2) * measure of arc BC.

      * The Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent line and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
      * Therefore, ∠C = (1/2) * measure of arc BC.

   * **Step 4:** Combine the information from Steps 2 and 3.
      * Since ∠A = (1/2) * measure of arc BC and ∠C = (1/2) * measure of arc BC, we can conclude that ∠A = ∠C.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to the line MP, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP.
      * **Reasoning:** Symmetry implies that the line MP bisects the angle ∠AMB.
   * **Step 2:** Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to the line NQ, we know that ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Divide the triangle into infinitesimally thin horizontal strips.
      * **Reasoning:** We can find the center of mass of the entire triangle by integrating the center of mass of each strip.
   * **Step 2:** Consider a strip at a distance 'y' from the base of the triangle with thickness 'dy'.
      * **Reasoning:** We need to define a variable to represent the position of each strip.
   * **Step 3:** The length of the strip is '2x'.
      * **Reasoning:** The triangle is isosceles, so the length of the strip is twice the distance from the y-axis to the edge of the triangle.

252,Consider the infinitely long chain of resistors shown below. What is the resistance between terminals a and b if R=1?,0.73,"1. **Problem:** What is the equivalent resistance between terminals a and b of an infinitely long chain of resistors, where each resistor has a resistance of R = 1?

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the repeating pattern.
      * The circuit consists of a repeating pattern of three resistors in parallel, followed by one resistor in series.
   * **Step 2:**  Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel section.
      * The formula for calculating the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel is: 1/R_eq = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + ...
      * In this case, we have three resistors in parallel, each with a resistance of R = 1.
      * Therefore, 1/R_eq = 1/1 + 1/1 + 1/1 = 3
      * Solving for R_eq, we get R_eq = 1/3.
   * **Step 3:**  Combine the equivalent resistance of the parallel section with the series resistor.
      * The equivalent resistance of the entire repeating pattern is the sum of the parallel section's resistance and the series resistor's resistance.
      * Therefore, the equivalent resistance of the repeating pattern is R_eq = 1/3 + 1 = 4/3.
   * **Step 4:**  Consider the infinite nature of the circuit.
      * Since the circuit is infinitely long, we can imagine removing the first repeating pattern and replacing it with a single equivalent resistor with a resistance of 4/3.
      * This new circuit will have the same equivalent resistance as the original circuit.
   * **Step 5:**  Set up an equation to represent the equivalent resistance.
      * Let R_total be the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit.
      * We can express R_total as the sum of the equivalent resistance of the first repeating pattern (4/3) and the resistance of the rest of the circuit, which is also R_total.
      * Therefore, R_total = 4/3 + R_total.
   * **Step 6:**  Solve for R_total.
      * Subtracting R_total from both sides of the equation, we get 0 = 4/3.
      * This equation has no solution, which means that the equivalent resistance of the circuit is infinite.

3. **Answer:** The equivalent resistance between terminals a and b of the infinitely long chain of resistors is **infinite**. This makes sense because the current has an infinite number of paths to take through the circuit, and the resistance of each path is finite. Therefore, the total resistance must be infinite.

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant theorem.
      * The problem involves two secants intersecting outside a circle. Therefore, we can use the **Secant-Secant Theorem**, which states that the product of the lengths of one secant segment and its external segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the other secant segment and its external segment.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between ∠ABD and ∠ACD.
      *  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the diameter. 
      *  Therefore, ∠ACB is a right angle (90°).
      *  ∠ACD is a part of ∠ACB, so ∠ACD = 90° - ∠BCD.

   * **Step 2:** Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
      *  The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      *  ∠ABD intercepts arc AD, and ∠ACD intercepts arc AD.
      *  Therefore, ∠ABD = 1/2 * arc AD and ∠ACD = 1/2 * arc AD.

      * **Reasoning:** The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees.
      * **Formula:**  Sum of interior angles = (n-2) * 180 degrees
      * **Applying the formula:** For a pentagon (n=5), the sum of interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.
      * **Calculation:** Since the pentagon is regular, all interior angles are equal. Therefore, each interior angle measures 540 degrees / 5 = 108 degrees.
   * **Step 2:**  Find the measure of angle AEO.
      * **Reasoning:**  Angle AEO is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AE, which is one-fifth of the circle.
      * **Formula:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Applying the formula:**  The measure of arc AE is (1/5) * 360 degrees = 72 degrees. Therefore, angle AEO measures (1/2) * 72 degrees = 36 degrees.
