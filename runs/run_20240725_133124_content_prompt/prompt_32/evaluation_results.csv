643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify key relationships:**
   -  CD is the diameter of the circle, meaning ∠COD is a right angle (90 degrees).
   -  DE || OA, meaning ∠D and ∠A are corresponding angles and therefore equal.

2. **Find ∠A:**
   - Since ∠D = 50 degrees, and ∠D = ∠A, then ∠A = 50 degrees.

3. **Find ∠COA:**
   - In triangle COA, we know ∠A = 50 degrees and ∠COA + ∠A + ∠ACO = 180 degrees (sum of angles in a triangle).
   - Since ∠COA is a central angle subtended by the same arc as ∠ACO, they are equal.
   - Therefore, ∠COA + ∠COA + 50 = 180.
   - Solving for ∠COA, we get ∠COA = 65 degrees.

4. **Find ∠C:**
   - In triangle COD, we know ∠COD = 90 degrees and ∠COA = 65 degrees.
   - Therefore, ∠C = ∠COD - ∠COA = 90 - 65 = 25 degrees.

**Therefore, the degree of ∠C is 25 degrees.**

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We are given the opposite side (4) and the hypotenuse (h) and we need to find the adjacent side. The trigonometric ratio that relates these three sides is the sine function: 
   sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse

2. **Substitute the values:** We know the angle is 60 degrees, the opposite side is 4, and the hypotenuse is h. So we can write:
   sin(60°) = 4 / h

3. **Solve for h:**
   * Multiply both sides by h: h * sin(60°) = 4
   * Divide both sides by sin(60°): h = 4 / sin(60°)

4. **Calculate the value:**  sin(60°) = √3 / 2. Substitute this value into the equation:
   h = 4 / (√3 / 2) = 8 / √3

5. **Rationalize the denominator:** Multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:

Therefore, the value of h is **8√3 / 3**.",False,0,3.153763771057129,550.0
887,"As shown in the figure, △ABC is the inscribed triangle of ⊙O. If ∠ABC = 70.0, then the degree of ∠AOC is equal to ()",140°,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding the Concepts**

* **Inscribed Angle:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share the same endpoint.
* **Central Angle:** A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle that share the same endpoint (the center of the circle).
* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Central Angle Theorem:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

**Solving the Problem**

1. **Identify the Intercepted Arc:**  ∠ABC intercepts arc AC.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** Since ∠ABC is an inscribed angle, its measure is half the measure of arc AC:
   ∠ABC = (1/2) * arc AC
   70° = (1/2) * arc AC
   arc AC = 140°

3. **Apply the Central Angle Theorem:** ∠AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc AC. Therefore:
   ∠AOC = arc AC = 140°

1. **Identify the relevant angles:** We are given that ∠AOD = 70°.  We also know that ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°).

2. **Calculate ∠BOD:**  Since ∠AOD + ∠BOD = 180°, we have ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.

3. **Understand angle bisectors:**  The problem states that ray OE bisects ∠BOC. This means that ∠BOE = ∠COE.

4. **Apply the angle bisector property:** Since ∠BOE + ∠COE = ∠BOC, and ∠BOE = ∠COE, we have 2∠BOE = ∠BOC.

5. **Calculate ∠BOC:**  We know that ∠BOD = 110° and ∠BOC is a part of it.  Therefore, ∠BOC = ∠BOD - ∠COD = 110° - ∠COD.  Since ∠COD is a straight angle (180°), we have ∠BOC = 110° - 180° = -70°.  However, angles are typically measured as positive values.  Since ∠BOC is a reflex angle (greater than 180°), we can find its positive equivalent by adding 360°: ∠BOC = -70° + 360° = 290°.

6. **Calculate ∠BOE:**  We know that 2∠BOE = ∠BOC = 290°.  Therefore, ∠BOE = 290°/2 = 145°.

7. **Calculate ∠AOE:**  Finally, we can find ∠AOE by subtracting ∠BOE from ∠AOB (which is a straight angle): ∠AOE = ∠AOB - ∠BOE = 180° - 145° = 35°.

**Therefore, ∠AOE = 35°.**

**1. Understand the Problem**

We have four charged particles arranged in a square. We need to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 due to the other three particles.

**2. Identify the Forces**

* **Force from particle 1 on particle 3 (F₁₃):** This force will be attractive (opposite charges) and will have both x and y components.
* **Force from particle 2 on particle 3 (F₂₃):** This force will be repulsive (same charges) and will only have an x-component (since the particles are aligned horizontally).
* **Force from particle 4 on particle 3 (F₄₃):** This force will be attractive (opposite charges) and will only have a y-component (since the particles are aligned vertically).

**3. Calculate the Magnitude of Each Force**

We'll use Coulomb's Law:

* F = k * |q₁| * |q₂| / r² 

Where:
* k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²)
* q₁ and q₂ are the magnitudes of the charges
* r is the distance between the charges

Let's calculate the magnitudes:

* **F₁₃:**  k * |100 nC| * |200 nC| / (a√2)²  (Note: the distance between 1 and 3 is the diagonal of the square, which is a√2)
* **F₂₃:** k * |100 nC| * |200 nC| / a²
* **F₄₃:** k * |200 nC| * |200 nC| / a²

**4. Determine the x-Components of Each Force**

* **F₁₃x:** F₁₃ * cos(45°) (The angle between F₁₃ and the x-axis is 45°)
* **F₂₃x:** F₂₃ (The force is entirely in the x-direction)
* **F₄₃x:** 0 (The force is entirely in the y-direction)

**5. Calculate the Net x-Component of Force**

The net x-component of force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of the individual forces:

* F_net_x = F₁₃x + F₂₃x + F₄₃x

**6. Substitute Values and Solve**

Plug in the values for k, charges, distance (a), and the calculated magnitudes of the forces. Remember to convert nC to C (1 nC = 10⁻⁹ C) and cm to m (1 cm = 10⁻² m).

After performing the calculations, you'll get the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3. 

**Important Note:** The direction of the net force will depend on the signs of the charges and the calculated x-components. If the net force is positive, it will be directed to the right; if it's negative, it will be directed to the left.

   -  AB has a length of 4 (count the grid squares).
   -  BC has a length of 3 (count the grid squares).

   -  AB² = AD² + BD²
   -  4² = AD² + BD²
   -  16 = AD² + BD²

   We need to find BD.  Notice that triangle BCD is also a right triangle.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem again:

**1. Understand the Properties**

* **Tangents from a Point:**  Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. This means PA = PB = 8.0.
* **Tangent-Radius Property:** A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°.

**2. Analyze the Triangle**

* **Right Triangles:**  Triangles OAC and OBD are right triangles.
* **Equal Sides:**  OA = OB (radii of the same circle).
* **Equal Angles:** ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°.

**3.  Find the Perimeter**

* **Perimeter of △PCD:**  Perimeter = PC + CD + PD.
* **Using Tangent Property:**  PC = PA - AC and PD = PB - BD.
* **Using Pythagorean Theorem:**  In right triangle OAC, AC² = OA² + OC² and in right triangle OBD, BD² = OB² + OD².

**4.  Simplify and Solve**

Since OA = OB and OC = OD (radii of the same circle), we can simplify:

* AC² = OA² + OC² = OB² + OD² = BD²
* Therefore, AC = BD.

Now, substitute the values:

* Perimeter = PC + CD + PD = (PA - AC) + CD + (PB - BD)
* Perimeter = (8 - AC) + CD + (8 - AC)
* Perimeter = 16 - 2AC + CD

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understanding Medians and Midpoints:** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. Since AD is a median, D is the midpoint of BC.

2. **Area Ratios:**  When a line segment is drawn from a vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side (a median), it divides the triangle into two triangles with equal areas. Therefore, the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD.

The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that a bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.  In this case, we have:

$$\frac{JQ}{QN} = \frac{JL}{LN}$$

We know that $JL = 16.5$ and $LN = 9 + QM$.  To find $QM$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $QMN$:

$$QM = \sqrt{QN^2 - MN^2}$$

We don't know $QN$ or $MN$, but we can use the fact that $Q$ is the incenter to find them.  The incenter is also the center of the inscribed circle of the triangle, and the radius of the inscribed circle is the distance from the incenter to each side of the triangle.  Therefore, $QN = QM = QP$.

Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle.  Then we have:

$$QN = QM = QP = r$$

We can use the area formula for a triangle to find $r$:

$$Area(\triangle JLN) = rs$$

where $s$ is the semiperimeter of $\triangle JLN$:

$$s = \frac{JL + LN + JN}{2}$$

We know $JL = 16.5$ and $LN = 9 + QM = 9 + r$.  To find $JN$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $JNP$:

$$JN = \sqrt{JP^2 + PN^2}$$

We know $JP = r$ and $PN = 16.5 - r$.  Therefore:

$$JN = \sqrt{r^2 + (16.5 - r)^2}$$

Now we can find $s$:

$$s = \frac{16.5 + 9 + r + \sqrt{r^2 + (16.5 - r)^2}}{2}$$

We can also find the area of $\triangle JLN$ using the formula $\frac{1}{2}bh$:

$$Area(\triangle JLN) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot JL \cdot PN = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 16.5 \cdot (16.5 - r)$$

Setting the two area formulas equal to each other, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \cdot 16.5 \cdot (16.5 - r) = r \cdot \frac{16.5 + 9 + r + \sqrt{r^2 + (16.5 - r)^2}}{2}$$

The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle ABC, given that AB = 6, and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13. We are also given that line DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB.

**Step 2: Use the properties of perpendicular bisectors**

Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 3.

**Step 3: Use the perimeter information**

The perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, which means:

AC + CE + AE = 13

**Step 4: Find the missing side lengths**

We know that AD = 3 and AB = 6, so BD = 3.  Since DE is a perpendicular bisector, we know that AE = BE.  Therefore, we can rewrite the perimeter equation as:

AC + CE + BE + BE = 13

Simplifying, we get:

AC + CE + 2BE = 13

**Step 5: Use the triangle inequality**

The triangle inequality states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  Applying this to triangle ABC, we have:

AB + BC > AC

Substituting the known values, we get:

6 + BC > AC

**Step 6: Solve for BC**

We can now solve for BC by combining the equations from steps 4 and 5:

AC + CE + 2BE = 13
6 + BC > AC

Since BE = BD = 3, we can substitute to get:

AC + CE + 6 = 13
6 + BC > AC

Simplifying, we get:

AC + CE = 7
BC > AC - 6

The perimeter of triangle ABC is:

AB + BC + AC = 6 + BC + AC

Since we know that BC > AC - 6, we can substitute to get:

6 + (AC - 6) + AC = 2AC

Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC is **2AC**.

2. **Identify key properties:**
   - **Parallelogram properties:** Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
   - **Angle bisector properties:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.

3. **Use angle bisector properties:**
   - Since BE bisects ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE.
   - Since CF bisects ∠BCD, we have ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

4. **Apply parallel lines and angles:**
   - Because AB || CD, we have ∠ABE = ∠CDE (alternate interior angles).
   - Similarly, ∠CBE = ∠CDF.

5. **Combine the information:**
   - From steps 3 and 4, we have ∠CDE = ∠CDF. This means that DE = DF (sides opposite equal angles in a triangle are equal).

6. **Find EF:**
   - Since AD = 4 and DE = DF, we have AE + EF + FD = 4.
   - Since DE = DF, we can write AE + 2EF = 4.
   - To find EF, we need to find AE.

7. **Find AE:**
   - Consider triangle ABE. We know AB = 3 and AD = 4. Since AB || CD, we have AE = AD - DE = 4 - DE.
   - To find DE, we can use the fact that ∠ABE = ∠CDE and ∠BAE = ∠CDE (alternate interior angles). This means triangles ABE and CDE are similar.
   - The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal. Therefore, AB/CD = AE/DE.
   - Since AB = CD (opposite sides of parallelogram), we have AE/DE = 1. This means AE = DE.
   - Therefore, AE = (1/2)AD = 2.

8. **Calculate EF:**
   - Substitute AE = 2 into the equation AE + 2EF = 4.
   - We get 2 + 2EF = 4.
   - Solving for EF, we get EF = 1.

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given that line AB intersects line CD at point O. We know that OD bisects ∠AOE, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts. We are also given that ∠BOC = 50°. Our goal is to find the measure of ∠EOB.

2. **Using Angle Relationships:**

   * **Vertical Angles:** ∠BOC and ∠AOD are vertical angles, meaning they are equal. Therefore, ∠AOD = 50°.

   * **Linear Pair:** ∠AOD and ∠DOE form a linear pair, meaning they add up to 180°. So, ∠DOE = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 50° = 130°.

**Understanding the Triangle Inequality**

The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.

**Applying the Theorem**

* **Case 1:**  If the third side is the smallest, it must be greater than the difference of the other two sides (12 - 7 = 5).
* **Case 2:** If the third side is the largest, it must be less than the sum of the other two sides (12 + 7 = 19).

**Finding the Impossible Perimeter**

* The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides.

* The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.
* In triangle ABC, CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB. Therefore, we have:
    * AD/DB = AC/BC
