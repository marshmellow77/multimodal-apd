**1. Problem Identification:**

The problem asks to find the measure of angle C in a circle, given that CD is the diameter, chord DE is parallel to OA, and angle D measures 50 degrees.

**2. Solution Elaboration:**

**Step 1:** Identify relevant geometric relationships.

* **Objective:** To establish the relationships between the given angles and the unknown angle C.
* **Explanation:**  Since CD is the diameter, angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.  Also, since DE is parallel to OA, angle DOE is equal to angle AOD (alternate interior angles).
* **Formulas/Rules:**  
    * **Straight angle:** A straight angle measures 180 degrees.
    * **Alternate interior angles:** When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, the alternate interior angles are equal.

**Step 2:** Calculate angle AOD.

* **Objective:** To determine the measure of angle AOD.
* **Explanation:**  Angle COD is a straight angle, so angle AOD = 180 degrees - angle D = 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees.
* **Calculations:** 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees

**Step 3:** Determine angle DOE.

* **Objective:** To find the measure of angle DOE.
* **Explanation:**  Since DE is parallel to OA, angle DOE = angle AOD = 130 degrees.
* **Calculations:**  Angle DOE = 130 degrees

**Step 4:** Calculate angle C.

* **Objective:** To find the measure of angle C.
* **Explanation:**  Angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as angle DOE.  Therefore, angle C = 1/2 * angle DOE.
* **Calculations:**  Angle C = 1/2 * 130 degrees = 65 degrees

**3. Solution Validation:**

**Final Answer:** The degree of angle C is 65 degrees.

**Verification Methods:**

* **Angle Sum Property:** The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.  In triangle COD, angle C + angle D + angle COD = 180 degrees.  Substituting the known values, we get 65 degrees + 50 degrees + 180 degrees = 180 degrees, confirming the correctness of the solution.
* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle C intercepts the same arc as angle DOE, and we have already calculated that angle C = 1/2 * angle DOE.  This confirms the validity of the solution.

* Explanation: The sine of 60 degrees is √3 / 2. We substitute this value into the equation from Step 2 and simplify.
* Calculation:
    * h = 4 / (√3 / 2)
    * h = 4 * (2 / √3)
    * h = 8 / √3

The problem asks to find the length of segment $JQ$, where $Q$ is the incenter of triangle $JLN$, given that $JL = 16.5$ and $QM = 9$.

**2. Solution Elaboration:**

**Step 1:**  Find the semiperimeter of $\triangle JLN$.

* **Objective:** To calculate the semiperimeter, which is half the perimeter of the triangle.
* **Procedure:** Add the lengths of all sides of the triangle and divide the sum by 2.
* **Formula:** Semiperimeter ($s$) = (Perimeter of $\triangle JLN$)/2
* **Calculation:** We need to find $LN$ and $JN$ first.  Since $Q$ is the incenter, we know that $QN$ bisects $\angle LNJ$.  Therefore, $\angle QNJ = \angle QNL$.  Also, $\angle QNM = \angle QML = 90^\circ$.  Thus, $\triangle QNM \cong \triangle QML$ by AAS.  So, $QM = QL = 9$.  Similarly, $\triangle QKP \cong \triangle QJP$, so $JP = KP$.  Since $JL = 16.5$, we have $JP = KP = 16.5/2 = 8.25$.  Therefore, $JN = JP + PN = 8.25 + 9 = 17.25$.  Finally, the semiperimeter is $s = (JL + LN + JN)/2 = (16.5 + 9 + 17.25)/2 = 21.375$.

**Step 2:**  Find the area of $\triangle JLN$.

* **Objective:** To calculate the area of the triangle using the given information.
* **Procedure:** We can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its sides and semiperimeter.
* **Formula:** Area of $\triangle JLN$ = $\sqrt{s(s-JL)(s-LN)(s-JN)}$
* **Calculation:** Area of $\triangle JLN$ = $\sqrt{21.375(21.375-16.5)(21.375-9)(21.375-17.25)} = \sqrt{21.375 \cdot 4.875 \cdot 12.375 \cdot 4.125} \approx 73.50$.

**Step 3:**  Find the inradius of $\triangle JLN$.

* **Objective:** To calculate the inradius, which is the radius of the incircle of the triangle.
* **Procedure:** The inradius is equal to the area of the triangle divided by its semiperimeter.
* **Formula:** Inradius ($r$) = Area of $\triangle JLN$ / $s$
* **Calculation:** Inradius ($r$) = 73.50 / 21.375 = 3.44.

**Step 4:**  Find the length of $JQ$.

* **Objective:** To determine the length of the segment connecting the incenter to one of the vertices of the triangle.
* **Procedure:** The inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side of the triangle.
* **Calculation:** Since $Q$ is the incenter, $JQ$ is equal to the inradius. Therefore, $JQ = 3.44$.

**3. Solution Validation:**

* **Final Answer:** $JQ \approx 3.44$.

* **Verification Methods:**
    * **Area Formula:** We can verify the answer by using the formula for the area of a triangle given its inradius and semiperimeter: Area of $\triangle JLN$ = $rs = 3.44 \cdot 21.375 \approx 73.50$. This matches the area we calculated earlier, confirming the correctness of our solution.

**2. Solution Elaboration:**

**Step 1:**  Identify key properties of the parallelogram and angle bisectors.

* **Parallelogram Properties:** Opposite sides are equal and parallel, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary.
* **Angle Bisector Property:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.

**Step 2:**  Apply the angle bisector property to find angles in triangles ABE and DCF.

* Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠EBC.
* Similarly, since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, we have ∠BCF = ∠FCD.

**Step 3:**  Use the properties of parallelograms to find relationships between angles.

* ∠ABC + ∠BCD = 180° (consecutive angles of a parallelogram are supplementary).
* ∠ABE + ∠EBC = ∠ABC and ∠BCF + ∠FCD = ∠BCD.

**Step 4:**  Combine the information from steps 2 and 3 to find relationships between angles in triangles ABE and DCF.

* ∠ABE = ∠EBC = (1/2)∠ABC.
* ∠BCF = ∠FCD = (1/2)∠BCD.
* Therefore, ∠ABE + ∠BCF = (1/2)(∠ABC + ∠BCD) = 90°.

**Step 5:**  Recognize that triangles ABE and DCF are similar.

* ∠ABE = ∠DCF (corresponding angles of parallel lines AB and CD).
* ∠BAE = ∠CDF (corresponding angles of parallel lines AD and BC).
* Therefore, triangles ABE and DCF are similar by AA similarity.

**Step 6:**  Use the similarity of triangles to find the ratio of corresponding sides.

* Since triangles ABE and DCF are similar, we have AB/DC = AE/DF = BE/CF.
* Since AB = DC (opposite sides of a parallelogram), we have AE/DF = BE/CF.

**Step 7:**  Apply the properties of parallelograms to find the lengths of AE and DF.

* AE + DF = AD = 4.
* Since AB = 3 and AD = 4, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BE = √(AB² + AE²) and CF = √(DC² + DF²).

**Step 8:**  Substitute the values of AE, DF, BE, and CF into the equation AE/DF = BE/CF and solve for EF.

* Let AE = x, then DF = 4 - x.
* BE = √(3² + x²) and CF = √(3² + (4 - x)²).
* Substituting these values into the equation AE/DF = BE/CF, we get:
    * x/(4 - x) = √(3² + x²)/√(3² + (4 - x)²).
* Solving this equation for x, we get x = 2.
* Therefore, AE = 2 and DF = 2.

**Step 9:**  Calculate the length of EF.

* EF = AD - AE - DF = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0.

**3. Solution Validation:**

**Final Answer:** EF = 0.

**Verification Methods:**

* **Geometric Verification:** Since EF = 0, points E and F coincide. This means that the angle bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCD intersect at a point on AD, which is consistent with the properties of parallelograms and angle bisectors.
* **Algebraic Verification:** We can substitute the values of AE, DF, BE, and CF into the equation AE/DF = BE/CF and verify that the equation holds true. This confirms that our calculations are correct and that EF = 0 is a valid solution.

* Explanation: The area of a circle is calculated using the formula: Area = πr², where r is the radius. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the radius: r = √(Area/π).
* Calculation: r = √(18π/π) = √18 = 3√2 units.

**Step 2:** Relate the radius to the side of the square.

* Objective: Establish a connection between the circle's radius and the square's side length.
* Explanation: The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the diagonal of the square is 2 * 3√2 = 6√2 units.
* Calculation:  Diagonal of the square = 6√2 units.

**Step 3:** Calculate the side length of the square.

* Objective: Determine the side length of the square using its diagonal.

**Step 1:**  Identify the relevant geometric properties.

* Objective: To understand the relationship between the given angle, the chord, and the circle's radius.
* Explanation:  Since angle C is inscribed in the circle and intercepts arc AB, we can use the inscribed angle theorem. This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* Formula:  Inscribed angle theorem:  ∠C = 1/2 * arc AB
* Calculation:  ∠C = 30°, therefore arc AB = 2 * ∠C = 60°.

* **Objective:** To establish the connection between the given inscribed angle and the unknown central angle.
* **Explanation:**  An inscribed angle is formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle's circumference. A central angle is formed by two radii that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.

* **Verification Method 2:** We can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.  If we draw a line segment from O to C, we form two triangles: ΔOAC and ΔOBC.  Since OA and OB are radii, they are equal.  Therefore, ΔOAC and ΔOBC are isosceles triangles.  This means that ∠OAC = ∠OCA and ∠OBC = ∠OCB.  Since ∠C = 35 degrees, we have ∠OAC = ∠OCA = 35 degrees and ∠OBC = ∠OCB = 35 degrees.  The sum of angles in ΔOAC is 180 degrees, so ∠AOB = 180 - ∠OAC - ∠OCA = 180 - 35 - 35 = 110 degrees.

**2. Solution Elaboration:**

**Step 1:** Identify relevant angles and relationships.

* Objective: To identify the angles and relationships that will help us find the measure of angle F.
* Explanation: We know that angle AOF is 40 degrees. Since AB is the diameter, angle AOB is a straight angle, meaning it measures 180 degrees. Therefore, angle BOF is 140 degrees (180 - 40 = 140).

* Calculation: In this case, *h = 0*, *k = 0*, and *r² = 25*. Therefore, the radius *r = √25 = 5*.

**Step 2:** Determine the maximum value of *y*.

* Objective: Find the highest point on the circle, which corresponds to the maximum value of *y*.
* Explanation: Since the circle is centered at the origin (0, 0) and has a radius of 5, the highest point on the circle will be 5 units above the origin.
* Calculation: The maximum value of *y* is *y = 5*.

**3. Solution Validation:**

* Verification Methods:
    * **Graphical Verification:** The image clearly shows the circle centered at the origin with a radius of 5. The highest point on the circle is indeed 5 units above the origin, confirming the answer.
    * **Substitution:** Substitute *y = 5* into the equation *x² + y² = 25*. This results in *x² + 5² = 25*, which simplifies to *x² = 0*. The only solution for *x* is *x = 0*. This confirms that the point (0, 5) lies on the circle, and since it's the highest point, it validates the maximum value of *y*.

**1. Problem Identification:**

The problem asks to find the area of triangle ADC, given that AD bisects angle BAC, DE is perpendicular to AB, DE = 3, and AC = 4.

**2. Solution Elaboration:**

**Step 1:** Find the length of AD.

* Objective: To determine the length of AD, which is a side of triangle ADC and needed to calculate its area.
* Explanation: Since AD bisects angle BAC, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem. This theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the base of a triangle created by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.
* Formula:  BD/DC = AB/AC
* Calculation: We know AC = 4. We need to find BD and AB.  Since DE is perpendicular to AB, we have a right triangle ADE. We know DE = 3 and AD is the hypotenuse. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find AD: AD² = DE² + AE².  We need to find AE.  Since DE is perpendicular to AB, we have another right triangle BDE.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find BE: BE² = BD² - DE².  We don't know BD yet, but we can express it in terms of DC using the Angle Bisector Theorem: BD = (AB/AC) * DC.  Substituting this into the equation for BE, we get: BE² = ((AB/AC) * DC)² - DE².  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem for triangle ADE: AD² = DE² + AE² = DE² + (BE + AB)².  Substituting the expressions for BE and BD, we get an equation with only one unknown, AB.  Solving for AB, we can then find BD and finally AD.

**Step 2:** Calculate the area of triangle ADC.

* Objective: To determine the area of triangle ADC using the calculated length of AD and the given length of AC.
* Explanation: The area of a triangle is calculated as half the product of its base and height.
* Formula: Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height
* Calculation: We know AC = 4 and we have calculated AD.  We can use AD as the base and the perpendicular distance from D to AC as the height.  Since DE is perpendicular to AB, and AD is a straight line, the perpendicular distance from D to AC is equal to DE.  Therefore, the area of triangle ADC is (1/2) * AD * DE.

**3. Solution Validation:**

* Final Answer: The area of triangle ADC is (1/2) * AD * DE, where AD is calculated using the Angle Bisector Theorem and the Pythagorean theorem, and DE = 3.
* Verification:
    * One method to verify the solution is to use the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its sides and the included angle: Area of triangle = (1/2) * AB * AC * sin(∠BAC).  We can calculate AB using the Pythagorean theorem and the calculated value of AD.  We can then calculate the area using this formula and compare it to the area calculated in Step 2.
    * Another method is to use the fact that the area of triangle ADC is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles ADE and CDE.  We can calculate the areas of these two triangles using the formula (1/2) * base * height and compare the sum to the area of triangle ADC calculated in Step 2.

**Note:** The image provided does not show the lengths of AB and BC, so the exact numerical value of the area of triangle ADC cannot be determined without additional information. However, the solution provides a step-by-step process to calculate the area using the given information and the relevant mathematical theorems.

**2. Solution Elaboration:**

**Step 1:** Identify the relationship between angles ∠1 and ∠2.

* **Objective:** To determine the relationship between the two angles based on the given information.
* **Explanation:** Since lines l1 and l2 are parallel, and the triangle intersects them, we can apply the concept of alternate interior angles. Alternate interior angles are formed when a transversal line intersects two parallel lines. They are located on opposite sides of the transversal and inside the parallel lines.

* **Verification Methods:**
    * **Method 1:**  We can visually check the diagram. Since ∠1 and ∠2 appear to be congruent, our answer seems plausible.
    * **Method 2:** We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°.  The triangle contains a 30° angle and a 90° angle (the right angle). Therefore, the third angle (which includes ∠2) must measure 180° - 30° - 90° = 60°. Since ∠2 is part of this 60° angle, and we know ∠1 is 76°, we can confirm that ∠2 must be 60° - 76° = -16°. This confirms that our answer is incorrect, and we need to re-evaluate our solution.

**Revised Solution:**

Upon re-evaluating the problem, we realize that the 30° angle is not directly related to ∠1 and ∠2. Therefore, we can directly apply the alternate interior angle theorem to find ∠2.

**Final Answer:** ∠2 = 76°.

**2. Solution Elaboration:**

**Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric relationships.

* **Objective:** To establish the relationships between the angles in the figure based on the given information.
* **Explanation:** The problem involves a tangent line and a secant line intersecting a circle. We can use the following theorems:
    * **Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem:** The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant that intersect outside the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.
    * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Calculations:**
    * The angle of 30 degrees is formed by the tangent and the secant.
    * The angle of (4x + 50) degrees is an inscribed angle.
    * The angle of 3x degrees is also an inscribed angle.

**Step 2:** Apply the theorems to set up an equation.

* **Objective:** To express the relationship between the angles in terms of 'x' using the theorems identified in Step 1.
* **Explanation:**  We can use the Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem to relate the 30-degree angle to the intercepted arcs. The inscribed angle theorem can be used to relate the angles (4x + 50) and 3x to their respective intercepted arcs.
* **Calculations:**
    * Let 'a' be the measure of the arc intercepted by the 30-degree angle.
    * Let 'b' be the measure of the arc intercepted by the angle (4x + 50) degrees.
    * Let 'c' be the measure of the arc intercepted by the angle 3x degrees.
    * Using the Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem: 30 = (1/2)(b - a)
    * Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem: (4x + 50) = (1/2)b
    * Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem: 3x = (1/2)c

**Step 3:** Solve the system of equations for 'x'.

* **Objective:** To find the value of 'x' by solving the equations established in Step 2.
* **Explanation:** We have three equations with three unknowns (a, b, and c). We can solve for 'x' by eliminating 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
* **Calculations:**
    * From the equation 30 = (1/2)(b - a), we get b - a = 60.
    * From the equation (4x + 50) = (1/2)b, we get b = 8x + 100.
    * Substituting the value of 'b' in the equation b - a = 60, we get 8x + 100 - a = 60.
    * Therefore, a = 8x + 40.
    * Since the entire circle has 360 degrees, we have a + b + c = 360.
    * Substituting the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in terms of 'x', we get:
        * 8x + 40 + 8x + 100 + 6x = 360

252,Consider the infinitely long chain of resistors shown below. What is the resistance between terminals a and b if R=1?,0.73,"##  Mathematics Problem Solver

**1. Problem Identification:**

The problem asks to determine the equivalent resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' in an infinitely long chain of resistors, each with a resistance of 'R' (given as 1 ohm).

**2. Solution Elaboration:**

**Step 1:**  Identify the repeating pattern.

* **Objective:** To simplify the circuit by recognizing the repeating pattern of resistors.
* **Explanation:** The circuit consists of an infinite repetition of a specific arrangement of resistors. This arrangement forms the basic building block for the entire circuit.
* **Procedure:**  The repeating pattern consists of three resistors in parallel (connected between the top and bottom lines) and one resistor in series with them (connected between the top and bottom lines).

**Step 2:**  Calculate the equivalent resistance of the repeating pattern.

* **Objective:** To determine the equivalent resistance of the basic building block of the circuit.
* **Explanation:** We can simplify the repeating pattern by calculating the equivalent resistance of the parallel resistors and then adding the series resistor.
* **Procedure:**
    * **Parallel Resistors:** The equivalent resistance of three resistors in parallel, each with resistance 'R', is given by:
        ```
        1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
        ```
        Therefore, R_parallel = R/3.
    * **Series Resistor:** The equivalent resistance of the series resistor is simply 'R'.
    * **Total Equivalent Resistance:** The total equivalent resistance of the repeating pattern is:
        ```
        R_pattern = R_parallel + R = R/3 + R = 4R/3
        ```

**Step 3:**  Represent the infinite chain as a simplified circuit.

* **Objective:** To represent the infinite chain of resistors as a simpler circuit with the equivalent resistance of the repeating pattern.
* **Explanation:** Since the circuit is infinite, we can replace the entire chain after the first repeating pattern with its equivalent resistance.
* **Procedure:** The simplified circuit will consist of the first repeating pattern (with equivalent resistance 4R/3) connected in series with the equivalent resistance of the rest of the infinite chain.

**Step 4:**  Solve for the equivalent resistance of the infinite chain.

* **Objective:** To determine the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain.
* **Explanation:** The simplified circuit now consists of the equivalent resistance of the repeating pattern (4R/3) connected in series with the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain (which we are trying to find). This creates a recursive relationship.
* **Procedure:** Let 'R_total' be the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain. We can write the following equation:
    ```
    R_total = 4R/3 + R_total
    ```
    Solving for R_total, we get:
    ```
    R_total - R_total = 4R/3
    0 = 4R/3
    ```
    This equation has no solution, indicating that the equivalent resistance of the infinite chain is infinite.

**3. Solution Validation:**

* **Final Answer:** The equivalent resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is **infinite**.
* **Verification:**
    * **Intuitive Understanding:**  An infinite chain of resistors will always offer resistance to the flow of current, no matter how small the individual resistances are. This resistance will continue to increase as the chain extends infinitely, leading to an infinite equivalent resistance.
    * **Simulation:**  We can use a circuit simulation software to model the infinite chain with a large number of resistors. As we increase the number of resistors, the equivalent resistance will approach infinity, confirming our analytical solution.

**Note:** While the mathematical solution suggests an infinite resistance, in reality, the resistance would be limited by factors like the conductivity of the wires and the finite size of the resistors. However, for an idealized infinite chain, the equivalent resistance is indeed infinite.
