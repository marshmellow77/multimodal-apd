643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Ah, Watson, this is a most intriguing puzzle!  Let us dissect it with the precision of a surgeon.

First, we must recognize that the problem involves the geometry of a circle.  The key to solving this lies in understanding the relationships between angles, chords, and diameters within a circle.

**Step 1:  Identifying Key Relationships**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In our case, ∠D intercepts arc CE.  Therefore, the measure of arc CE is twice the measure of ∠D, which is 2 * 50° = 100°.

* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  ∠COE intercepts arc CE.  Therefore, ∠COE also measures 100°.

* **Parallel Lines:**  Since DE ∥ OA, we know that ∠D and ∠A are corresponding angles and are therefore equal.  Thus, ∠A also measures 50°.

**Step 2:  Applying the Knowledge**

Now, let's focus on triangle AOC.  We know that ∠A = 50° and ∠COE = 100°.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, we can calculate ∠C:

∠C = 180° - ∠A - ∠COE = 180° - 50° - 100° = 30°

**Conclusion**

Therefore, Watson, the degree of ∠C is **30°**.  This solution, while seemingly simple, reveals a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships within a circle.  It is this understanding that will guide us towards the truth in this case.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"Ah, Watson, this is a most intriguing puzzle!  It appears we have a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees and the side opposite that angle measuring 4 units.  We need to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is labeled 'h'.

Fear not, Watson, for this is a simple matter of trigonometry.  Let us recall the **SOH CAH TOA** mnemonic, which stands for:

* **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse
* **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse
* **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent

In our case, we know the opposite side (4 units) and the angle (60 degrees).  Therefore, we can use the sine function:

**sin(60°) = Opposite / Hypotenuse**

We know that sin(60°) = √3 / 2.  Substituting the values we have:

√3 / 2 = 4 / h

To solve for 'h', we can cross-multiply:

h * √3 = 8

Finally, we isolate 'h' by dividing both sides by √3:

h = 8 / √3

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by √3:

h = (8 * √3) / (√3 * √3)

h = 8√3 / 3

Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse, 'h', is **8√3 / 3 units**.

First, let us recall a fundamental principle of geometry: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In our case, ∠ABC intercepts arc AC.  Therefore, the measure of arc AC is twice the measure of ∠ABC, or 2 * 70° = 140°.

Now, consider the central angle ∠AOC.  This angle also intercepts arc AC.  A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Thus, ∠AOC = 140°.

First, we must understand the formula for calculating the area of a trapezoid.  It is:

**Area = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * (height)**

Let's break it down:

* **Parallel sides:** These are the two sides that never intersect, no matter how far they are extended. In our case, they are the 41 ft and 53 ft sides.
* **Height:** This is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel sides.  In our case, it is the 48 ft side.

Now, let's plug in the values:

**Area = (1/2) * (41 ft + 53 ft) * (48 ft)**

**Area = (1/2) * (94 ft) * (48 ft)**

**Area = 47 ft * 48 ft**

If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"Ah, Watson, this is a rather simple problem, though it may appear daunting at first glance.  Let us break it down step by step.

Observe that the line segment PQ represents the radius of the smaller circle, and the line segment PR represents the radius of the larger circle.  We are given that the radius of the larger circle, PR, is 4.

Now, notice that the line segment PR is simply the sum of the line segments PQ and QR.  Since QR is also a radius of the smaller circle, we can express this relationship as:

PR = PQ + QR

Substituting the known value of PR and recognizing that PQ and QR are both radii of the smaller circle, we get:

4 = PQ + PQ

Combining like terms, we have:

4 = 2PQ

To isolate PQ, the radius of the smaller circle, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

4 / 2 = 2PQ / 2

This simplifies to:

2 = PQ

Observe, my dear Watson, that each triangle has three numbers: one at the apex and two at the base.  The key lies in understanding the relationship between these numbers.

Let's examine the first triangle:

* Apex: 2
* Base: 6 and 2

Notice that the apex number is the result of dividing the two base numbers: 6 / 2 = 3.  However, the apex number is 2, not 3.  This suggests a further operation.

Let's try subtracting the two base numbers: 6 - 2 = 4.  Again, this doesn't match the apex number.

Now, let's try adding the two base numbers: 6 + 2 = 8.  Finally, we have a number that relates to the apex number.  If we divide this sum by 4, we get 8 / 4 = 2, which is the apex number!

Let's test this theory on the other triangles:

* **Triangle 2:** 1 + 3 = 4, 4 / 4 = 1 (Apex number)
* **Triangle 3:** 2 + 5 = 7, 7 / 4 = 1.75 (Apex number)

Therefore, the formula for calculating the apex number is:

**(Base number 1 + Base number 2) / 4 = Apex number**

The problem presents us with a diagram of two intersecting lines, AB and CD, forming four angles at their point of intersection, O.  A third line, OE, bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides it into two equal angles.  We are given that angle AOD is 70 degrees, and we are tasked with finding the measure of angle AOE.

Now, Watson, observe the following:

1. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  Angles AOD and DOB form a straight angle, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle DOB = 180 degrees - 70 degrees = 110 degrees.

2. **Vertical Angles:**  Angles DOB and AOC are vertical angles, meaning they are equal.  Therefore, angle AOC = 110 degrees.

3. **Angle Bisector:**  Line OE bisects angle BOC, meaning angle BOE = angle COE.  Since angle BOC = angle AOC + angle COB = 110 degrees + angle COB, we can say that angle BOE = angle COE = (110 degrees + angle COB) / 2.

4. **Angles at a Point:**  Angles AOE, BOE, and AOC form a complete angle, meaning they add up to 360 degrees.  Therefore, angle AOE + angle BOE + angle AOC = 360 degrees.

5. **Substitution:**  Substituting the values we have derived, we get: angle AOE + (110 degrees + angle COB) / 2 + 110 degrees = 360 degrees.

6. **Solving for Angle AOE:**  Simplifying the equation, we get: angle AOE + (110 degrees + angle COB) / 2 = 250 degrees.  Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 2 * angle AOE + 110 degrees + angle COB = 500 degrees.  Rearranging the terms, we get: 2 * angle AOE = 390 degrees - angle COB.  Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we get: angle AOE = (390 degrees - angle COB) / 2.

Therefore, Watson, the measure of angle AOE is (390 degrees - angle COB) / 2.  While we cannot determine the exact value of angle AOE without knowing the measure of angle COB, we have successfully expressed it in terms of a known variable.

What is the $x$ component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3?",0.17,"Ah, Watson, a most intriguing puzzle indeed! This mathematical riddle, scrawled upon the blackboard, holds the key to unlocking this perplexing case. Fear not, for I shall guide you through its intricacies with the utmost clarity.

First, let us dissect the problem. We have four charged particles, labeled 1 through 4, arranged at the corners of a square. The charges of particles 1 and 2 are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, as are the charges of particles 3 and 4. The distance between each particle is denoted by 'a'. We are tasked with finding the x-component of the net electrostatic force acting on particle 3.

Now, let us recall Coulomb's Law, the fundamental principle governing electrostatic forces. It states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

```
F = k * (q1 * q2) / r^2
```

Where:

* F is the electrostatic force
* k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
* q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges
* r is the distance between the charges

Now, let's analyze the forces acting on particle 3. We have three forces to consider:

1. **Force due to particle 1 (F13):** This force is attractive since particles 1 and 3 have opposite charges. The x-component of this force is given by:

```
F13x = k * (q1 * q3) / (2a^2) * cos(45°)
```

The factor of 2 in the denominator arises from the distance between particles 1 and 3 being the diagonal of the square, which is √2 times the side length 'a'. The cosine of 45° accounts for the angle between the force and the x-axis.

2. **Force due to particle 2 (F23):** This force is repulsive since particles 2 and 3 have the same charge. The x-component of this force is given by:

```
F23x = k * (q2 * q3) / a^2
```

3. **Force due to particle 4 (F43):** This force is attractive since particles 3 and 4 have opposite charges. The x-component of this force is zero since the force acts purely in the y-direction.

Therefore, the net x-component of the electrostatic force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of the individual forces:

```
Fnetx = F13x + F23x + F43x
```

Substituting the expressions for each force, we get:

```
Fnetx = k * (q1 * q3) / (2a^2) * cos(45°) + k * (q2 * q3) / a^2 + 0
```

Simplifying the expression and substituting the given values for the charges and distance, we obtain:

```
Fnetx = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) * (1/√2) / (2 * (5.0 × 10^-2 m)^2) + (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (5.0 × 10^-2 m)^2
```

Evaluating this expression, we find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 to be approximately **0.144 N**.

Thus, Watson, we have successfully deciphered the mathematical riddle. The x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is 0.144 N.

First, we must understand the relationship between angles formed by intersecting lines.  Observe that angles 1 and 3 are **vertical angles**.  Vertical angles are always congruent, meaning they have the same measure.  Therefore, $m∠3 = m∠1 = 123°$.

Next, we see that angles 3 and 10 are **supplementary angles**.  Supplementary angles add up to 180°.  Thus, $m∠10 = 180° - m∠3 = 180° - 123° = 57°$.

It appears we have a right triangle, with the lengths of two sides provided.  The key to unlocking this mystery lies in the Pythagorean Theorem, a fundamental principle of geometry.

The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In our case, the hypotenuse is JK, with a length of 14, and one of the other sides is KL, with a length of 9.  Let's call the unknown side JL, 'x'.

Applying the Pythagorean Theorem, we have:

14² = 9² + x²

Simplifying the equation:

196 = 81 + x²

Subtracting 81 from both sides:

115 = x²

To find the length of JL, we need to find the square root of 115:

Therefore:

Our objective is to determine the length of AD.

Now, Watson, let us employ the principles of geometry to unravel this mystery.  Observe that triangle ABC is a right triangle, with angle B being the right angle.  We can utilize the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AC, the hypotenuse of this triangle.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In our case, AB is the base and BC is the height.  Let's count the grid squares to determine their lengths:

* AB = 4 units
* BC = 3 units

Applying the Pythagorean theorem:

AC² = AB² + BC²
AC² = 4² + 3²
AC² = 16 + 9
AC² = 25
AC = √25
AC = 5 units

Now, let's focus on triangle ADC.  This is also a right triangle, with angle D being the right angle.  We know AC = 5 units and CD = 1 unit (as it spans one grid square).  We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find AD:

First, we must understand the properties of tangents.  A tangent line to a circle touches the circle at exactly one point.  The radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line.  This is a fundamental principle we shall use.

Now, let's examine the diagram.  We see that PA and PB are tangents to the circle, and CD is also a tangent.  Therefore, we can draw radii OA, OB, and OE, where E is the point of tangency of CD with the circle.

Since OA is perpendicular to PA and OB is perpendicular to PB, we have two right angles, ∠OAP and ∠OBP.  Furthermore, ∠OEA and ∠OED are also right angles.

Now, consider quadrilateral OAPB.  The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360 degrees.  Therefore, ∠AOB + ∠OAP + ∠OBP + ∠APB = 360 degrees.  Since ∠OAP and ∠OBP are right angles, we have ∠AOB + ∠APB = 180 degrees.

Similarly, in quadrilateral OECD, we have ∠COE + ∠OED + ∠ECD + ∠COD = 360 degrees.  Since ∠OED and ∠COD are right angles, we have ∠COE + ∠ECD = 180 degrees.

Now, notice that ∠APB and ∠ECD are both subtended by the same arc AB.  Therefore, they are equal.  This means ∠AOB = ∠COE.

Since OA = OB and OE is a common side, we have △OAE ≅ △OBE by the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) congruence theorem.  Therefore, AE = BE.

Now, let's consider the perimeter of △PCD.  It is PC + CD + PD.  Since PA = PB = 8.0, we have PC + PD = PA + PB - AC - BD = 16 - AC - BD.

Since AE = BE, we have AC = AE + EC and BD = BE + ED.  Therefore, AC + BD = 2AE + EC + ED = 2AE + CD.

Substituting this into the expression for the perimeter of △PCD, we get PC + CD + PD = 16 - 2AE - CD + CD = 16 - 2AE.

Finally, since AE is a radius of the circle, its length is constant.  Therefore, the perimeter of △PCD is a constant value, independent of the position of points C and D.

Thus, the perimeter of △PCD is **16 - 2AE**, where AE is the radius of the circle.  This is the solution to the mathematical riddle, Watson.  It may not be the key to the entire case, but it is a vital piece of the puzzle.  Now, let us see what other clues we can uncover!

2. **Angle BCD:**  CD bisects angle ACB, so angle BCD is half of angle ACB.  We need to find angle ACB to determine angle BCD.

3. **Angle ABC:**  We know angle DBC is 54 degrees.  Since angle ABD is equal to angle A, and the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle ABC:
    * Angle ABC = 180 degrees - angle ABD - angle DBC
    * Angle ABC = 180 degrees - angle A - 54 degrees

4. **Angle ACB:**  Now, we can find angle ACB using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees:
    * Angle ACB = 180 degrees - angle A - angle ABC
    * Angle ACB = 180 degrees - angle A - (180 degrees - angle A - 54 degrees)
    * Angle ACB = 54 degrees

5. **Angle BCD:**  Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle BCD is half of angle ACB:
    * Angle BCD = 54 degrees / 2 = 27 degrees

6. **Angle A:**  Finally, we can find angle A using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees:
    * Angle A = 180 degrees - angle ABC - angle ACB
    * Angle A = 180 degrees - (180 degrees - angle A - 54 degrees) - 54 degrees

The problem presents us with a triangle ABC, where AD is the median (a line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side).  Point E is the midpoint of AD.  We are given that the area of triangle ABE is 2.  Our task is to find the area of the larger triangle ABC.

**Step 2:  The Power of Medians**

The key to solving this lies in the properties of medians.  A median divides a triangle into two triangles of equal area.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD.

**Step 3:  The Ratio of Areas**

Now, consider triangle ABD.  Line segment AE is a median of this triangle.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABE is half the area of triangle ABD.  Since the area of triangle ABE is 2, the area of triangle ABD is 2 * 2 = 4.

**Step 4:  The Final Solution**

As we established earlier, the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of triangles ABD and ACD, which is 4 + 4 = 8.

To find the scale factor, we need to determine the ratio of corresponding side lengths.  Notice that the distance from $C$ to $Q$ is 5 units, and the distance from $C$ to $Q'$ is 20 units (15 + 5).

Therefore, the scale factor is the ratio of these distances:

This means that $Q'$ is four times larger than $Q$.  A most illuminating discovery, Watson!  Perhaps this will lead us to the culprit.

776,Find $JQ$ if $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$.  Rounded to the nearest hundredth.,18.79,"Ah, Watson, this is a most intriguing puzzle!  Let us dissect it with our usual precision.

First, we must understand what an incenter is. The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  This point is also the center of the triangle's incircle, which is the circle that is tangent to all three sides of the triangle.

Now, let's examine the diagram. We see that $\triangle JLN$ has an incenter at point $Q$.  This means that $JQ$, $QL$, and $QN$ are all angle bisectors of $\triangle JLN$.

To find $JQ$, we can use the following formula:

$$JQ = \frac{s - JL}{2}$$

where $s$ is the semiperimeter of $\triangle JLN$.  The semiperimeter is half the perimeter of the triangle.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Find the perimeter of $\triangle JLN$:**  We are given that $JL = 16.5$.  To find the perimeter, we need to find $LN$ and $JN$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $LN$ and $JN$.

2. **Find $LN$:**  We see that $\triangle KLM$ is a right triangle with $KM = 9$ and $LM = KL + LN$.  We need to find $KL$ and $LN$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $KL$.  We know that $KL$ is the altitude from $K$ to $JL$, and we know that $JL = 16.5$.  We can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find $KL$:

$$Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot base \cdot height$$

$$Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot JL \cdot KL$$

$$Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 16.5 \cdot KL$$

We also know that the area of $\triangle KLM$ is:

$$Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot KM \cdot LM$$

$$Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9 \cdot (KL + LN)$$

Setting these two expressions for the area equal to each other, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \cdot 16.5 \cdot KL = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9 \cdot (KL + LN)$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$8.25KL = 4.5KL + 4.5LN$$

$$3.75KL = 4.5LN$$

$$KL = \frac{4.5}{3.75}LN$$

$$KL = 1.2LN$$

Now we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $LN$:

$$KL^2 + KM^2 = LM^2$$

$$(1.2LN)^2 + 9^2 = (KL + LN)^2$$

$$1.44LN^2 + 81 = (1.2LN + LN)^2$$

$$1.44LN^2 + 81 = 5.76LN^2$$

$$81 = 4.32LN^2$$

$$LN^2 = \frac{81}{4.32}$$

$$LN = \sqrt{\frac{81}{4.32}}$$

$$LN \approx 4.33$$

3. **Find $JN$:**  We see that $\triangle JPN$ is a right triangle with $JP = JN - JP$ and $PN = 9$.  We need to find $JP$ and $JN$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $JP$.  We know that $JP$ is the altitude from $J$ to $LN$, and we know that $LN = 4.33$.  We can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find $JP$:

$$Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot base \cdot height$$

$$Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot LN \cdot JP$$

$$Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4.33 \cdot JP$$

We also know that the area of $\triangle JPN$ is:

$$Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot JN \cdot PN$$

$$Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot JN \cdot 9$$

Setting these two expressions for the area equal to each other, we get:

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

The problem presents us with a triangle ABC, where AB is bisected perpendicularly by line DE.  We are given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13.  Our goal is to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

**Step 2:  Visualizing the Solution**

Imagine, Watson, that we draw a line segment from point D to point C.  This creates two smaller triangles:  triangle ADC and triangle BDC.  Since line DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB.  Furthermore, since angles ADC and BDC are both right angles, we can conclude that triangles ADC and BDC are congruent.

**Step 3:  Applying the Congruence**

The congruence of triangles ADC and BDC is crucial.  It tells us that AC = BC.  Now, let's consider the perimeter of triangle ACE:

Perimeter of triangle ACE = AC + CE + AE = 13

**Step 4:  Finding the Missing Side**

We know that AC = BC, and we are given that AB = 6.  Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC can be expressed as:

Perimeter of triangle ABC = AB + BC + AC = 6 + AC + AC = 6 + 2AC

**Step 5:  Solving for AC**

We know that the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, and we know that AC + CE + AE = 13.  Since AC = BC, we can rewrite this as:

AC + CE + AE = 13
2AC + CE + AE = 13

Now, notice that 2AC + CE + AE is simply the perimeter of triangle ABC minus AB.  Therefore:

Perimeter of triangle ABC - AB = 13
Perimeter of triangle ABC - 6 = 13
Perimeter of triangle ABC = 19

**Conclusion**

Thus, Watson, the perimeter of triangle ABC is 19.  This mathematical riddle, though seemingly complex, was solved by applying the principles of geometry and congruence.

First, we must understand the given information. We have a parallelogram ABCD, with AB = 3 and AD = 4.  The angle bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCD intersect AD at points E and F, respectively.  Our goal is to find the length of EF.

Now, let's apply our deductive reasoning.  Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we know that ∠ABE = ∠CBE.  Similarly, since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, we know that ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

Observe that ∠ABE + ∠CBE + ∠BCF + ∠DCF = 180° (angles on a straight line).  Therefore, 2∠ABE + 2∠BCF = 180°, which simplifies to ∠ABE + ∠BCF = 90°.

Now, consider triangle BEF.  We have ∠BEF = ∠ABE + ∠BCF = 90°.  Therefore, triangle BEF is a right-angled triangle with ∠BEF as the right angle.

Next, let's focus on triangle ABE.  We know that AB = 3 and AD = 4.  Since AE is a part of AD, we can deduce that AE = AD - DE = 4 - DE.

Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle ABE, we have:

BE² = AB² + AE² = 3² + (4 - DE)² = 9 + 16 - 8DE + DE²

Similarly, using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle CFE, we have:

CF² = CD² + DF² = 3² + (4 - DE)² = 9 + 16 - 8DE + DE²

Now, consider triangle BEF.  Using the Pythagorean theorem again, we have:

EF² = BE² + CF² = (9 + 16 - 8DE + DE²) + (9 + 16 - 8DE + DE²) = 2(9 + 16 - 8DE + DE²) = 2(25 - 8DE + DE²)

Expanding the equation, we get:

EF² = 50 - 16DE + 2DE²

To find EF, we need to find DE.  We can do this by using the fact that the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.  Therefore, BC = AD = 4.

Now, consider triangle BCE.  We know that BC = 4 and BE = CF (from the Pythagorean theorem calculations).  Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle BCE, we have:

CE² = BC² + BE² = 4² + (9 + 16 - 8DE + DE²) = 16 + 25 - 8DE + DE² = 41 - 8DE + DE²

Since CE = DE + EF, we can substitute this into the equation:

(DE + EF)² = 41 - 8DE + DE²

Expanding the equation, we get:

DE² + 2DE * EF + EF² = 41 - 8DE + DE²

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2DE * EF + EF² = 41 - 8DE

Substituting the value of EF² from the previous equation, we get:

2DE * EF + (50 - 16DE + 2DE²) = 41 - 8DE

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2DE * EF + 50 - 16DE + 2DE² = 41 - 8DE

Combining like terms, we get:

2DE * EF + 2DE² - 8DE + 9 = 0

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

DE * EF + DE² - 4DE + 4.5 = 0

Factoring the equation, we get:

(DE + 4.5)(DE - 1) = 0

Therefore, DE = -4.5 or DE = 1.  Since DE cannot be negative, we have DE = 1.

Finally, substituting DE = 1 into the equation for EF², we get:

EF² = 50 - 16(1) + 2(1)² = 36

Therefore, EF = √36 = 6.

First, we must understand the given information. We are told that line AB intersects line CD at point O. This means that point O is the common point where both lines meet.  We are also given that OD bisects ∠AOE.  Bisect means to divide into two equal parts.  Therefore, ∠AOD = ∠DOE.  Finally, we are given that ∠BOC = 50°.

Now, let's apply our knowledge of angles.  We know that angles on a straight line add up to 180°.  Therefore, ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 180°.  We also know that ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 180°.  Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we can say that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.  Therefore, 2∠AOD + ∠EOB = 180°.

Now, let's focus on the angles around point O.  We know that ∠BOC + ∠COE + ∠EOA = 360°.  We also know that ∠BOC = 50°.  Therefore, 50° + ∠COE + ∠EOA = 360°.  This simplifies to ∠COE + ∠EOA = 310°.

Now, let's combine our knowledge.  We know that 2∠AOD + ∠EOB = 180° and ∠COE + ∠EOA = 310°.  We also know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE and ∠EOA = ∠AOD + ∠DOE.  Therefore, we can substitute these values into our equations.  This gives us:

2(∠AOD) + ∠EOB = 180°
∠COE + (∠AOD + ∠DOE) = 310°

Simplifying these equations, we get:

2∠AOD + ∠EOB = 180°
∠COE + 2∠AOD = 310°

Now, we can solve for ∠EOB.  Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

∠EOB - ∠COE = -130°

Since ∠COE + ∠EOB = 360°, we can substitute this value into the equation above.  This gives us:

∠EOB - (360° - ∠EOB) = -130°

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2∠EOB = 230°

Therefore, ∠EOB = 115°.

First, we must recognize that trapezoid ABCD has two parallel sides, AB and CD.  The other two sides, AD and BC, are not parallel.  This is crucial to our understanding.

Now, let's draw a perpendicular line from point C to side AD, intersecting AD at point E.  This creates a right triangle, CBE.  We know that BC = 16 and AB = 24.  Therefore, AE = AB - BE = 24 - 16 = 8.

Since CE is perpendicular to AD, we have a right triangle, AEC.  We know that AE = 8 and AD = 23.  Therefore, EC = √(AD² - AE²) = √(23² - 8²) = √(529 - 64) = √465.

Now, we can find CD.  We know that CD = CE + ED.  Since ED = AE = 8, we have CD = √465 + 8.

Therefore, the length of segment CD is **√465 + 8**.

Let us dissect it with the precision of a surgeon.

First, we must understand the fundamentals.  The central angle of an arc is the angle formed by two radii drawn from the center of the circle to the endpoints of the arc.  The measure of the central angle is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc.

Now, let's examine the given information.  We know that the central angle of ⁀AB is 90.0 degrees.  This means that ⁀AB is a quarter of the entire circle, as a circle has 360 degrees.

Similarly, the central angle of ⁀CD is 50.0 degrees.  Therefore, ⁀CD is 50/360 or 5/36 of the entire circle.

Now, let's focus on the angles at point P.  We can see that ∠APC is an exterior angle of triangle PAC.  The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.  Therefore, ∠APC = ∠PAC + ∠PCA.

Similarly, ∠BPD is an exterior angle of triangle PBD.  Therefore, ∠BPD = ∠PBD + ∠PDB.

Now, let's consider the angles within the circle.  ∠PAC is an inscribed angle that intercepts ⁀BC.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, ∠PAC = 1/2 * ∠BOC.

Similarly, ∠PCA is an inscribed angle that intercepts ⁀AD.  Therefore, ∠PCA = 1/2 * ∠AOD.

Now, let's substitute these values back into our equations for ∠APC and ∠BPD.

∠APC = ∠PAC + ∠PCA = 1/2 * ∠BOC + 1/2 * ∠AOD = 1/2 * (∠BOC + ∠AOD)

∠BPD = ∠PBD + ∠PDB = 1/2 * ∠BOD + 1/2 * ∠COD = 1/2 * (∠BOD + ∠COD)

Now, let's consider the entire circle.  We know that ∠BOC + ∠AOD + ∠BOD + ∠COD = 360 degrees.

Therefore, ∠APC + ∠BPD = 1/2 * (∠BOC + ∠AOD) + 1/2 * (∠BOD + ∠COD) = 1/2 * 360 degrees = 180 degrees.

Finally, we can see that ∠APC + ∠BPD + ∠P = 360 degrees.  Therefore, ∠P = 360 degrees - ∠APC - ∠BPD = 360 degrees - 180 degrees = 180 degrees.

Thus, the answer is ∠P = 180 degrees.

First, we must understand the relationship between the circle and the square. The square is inscribed within the circle, meaning its corners touch the circle's circumference.  This creates a crucial connection: the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.

Now, let's delve into the given information. The area of the circle is 18π square units.  We know the formula for the area of a circle is πr², where 'r' is the radius.  Therefore:

πr² = 18π

Dividing both sides by π, we get:

r² = 18

Taking the square root of both sides:

r = √18 = 3√2

Since the diameter is twice the radius, the diameter of the circle is 2 * 3√2 = 6√2.

Remember, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.  Let's call the side of the square 's'.  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can relate the diagonal (d) and the side (s) of the square:

d² = s² + s² = 2s²

We know d = 6√2, so:

(6√2)² = 2s²

36 * 2 = 2s²

Finally, we turn our attention to triangle CAB.  We know ∠CAD is 64 degrees, and ∠CAB is the angle we seek.  Since AB is the diameter, ∠ACB is a right angle, measuring 90 degrees.  Applying the same principle of angle sum in a triangle, we find ∠CAB = 180 - 90 - 64 = 26 degrees.

The key to unlocking this mystery lies in understanding the relationship between angles within a circle.  Observe, my dear Watson, that the angle at the center of the circle, ∠O, is twice the measure of the inscribed angle, ∠C.

* **Inscribed Angle:** An angle formed by two chords of a circle that share a common endpoint on the circle's circumference. In our case, ∠C is the inscribed angle.
* **Central Angle:** An angle formed by two radii of a circle that share a common endpoint at the center of the circle.  Here, ∠O is the central angle.

The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.  Therefore, we can deduce:

Observe the diagram, Watson. We are presented with a quadrilateral, ABCD, and a triangle, AED.  The key to solving this lies in understanding the properties of parallel lines and angles.

**Step 1: Identifying Parallel Lines and Corresponding Angles**

Notice that AB is parallel to CD, and BC is parallel to DE.  This is crucial information, as it tells us about the relationship between the angles formed by these lines.

When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal (a line that crosses them), corresponding angles are equal.  Let's apply this to our diagram:

* Since AB || CD, we know that ∠A = ∠CDE (corresponding angles).
* Similarly, since BC || DE, we know that ∠B = ∠AED (corresponding angles).

**Step 2: Finding the Missing Angle**

We are given that ∠A = 45° and ∠C = 110°.  Since ∠A = ∠CDE, we know that ∠CDE = 45°.

Now, let's focus on the quadrilateral ABCD.  The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360°.  Therefore:

∠A + ∠B + ∠C + ∠D = 360°

Substituting the known values:

45° + ∠B + 110° + 45° = 360°

Solving for ∠B:

∠B = 360° - 45° - 110° - 45° = 160°

We know that ∠B = ∠AED.  Therefore, ∠AED = 160°.

1. **Understanding the Relationship between Areas:**

   - Observe that triangles ACD and ABD share the same height, which is the perpendicular distance from point A to line BC.  Let's denote this height as 'h'.

   - The ratio of their areas is directly proportional to the ratio of their bases:

Let's apply this to our triangle.  Since D and E are the midpoints of AC and AB, DE is parallel to BC and half its length.

Now, to find the length of BC, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

First, let us examine the diagram. We have a triangle ABC, with N being the midpoint of BC.  AM bisects angle BAC, and BM is perpendicular to AM.  We are given that AB = 8 and MN = 2.  Our objective is to find the length of AC.

Now, let's apply our deductive reasoning.  Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know that BN = NC.  Furthermore, since AM bisects angle BAC, we have angle BAM = angle CAM.

Let's focus on triangle ABM.  We know that BM is perpendicular to AM, making angle BMA a right angle.  Therefore, triangle ABM is a right-angled triangle.

Now, let's apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ABM.  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In our case, AB is the hypotenuse, and BM and AM are the other two sides.  Therefore, we have:

AB² = BM² + AM²

We know that AB = 8, and we need to find AM.  To do this, let's consider triangle AMN.  We know that MN = 2, and we need to find AM.  Since BM is perpendicular to AM, we have angle AMN = 90 degrees.  Therefore, triangle AMN is also a right-angled triangle.

Applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle AMN, we have:

AM² = AN² + MN²

We know that MN = 2, and we need to find AN.  To do this, let's consider triangle ABC.  We know that N is the midpoint of BC, so BN = NC.  Therefore, we have:

AN = AB - BN = AB - (BC/2)

We know that AB = 8, and we need to find BC.  To do this, let's consider triangle BMN.  We know that BM is perpendicular to AM, and we know that MN = 2.  Therefore, we have:

BN² = BM² + MN²

We know that MN = 2, and we need to find BM.  To do this, let's consider triangle ABM.  We know that AB = 8, and we know that AM² = AN² + MN².  Therefore, we have:

BM² = AB² - AM² = AB² - (AN² + MN²)

Now, we have all the information we need to solve for BC, AN, AM, and finally, AC.

Let's start by solving for BC:

BN² = BM² + MN²
BN² = (AB² - (AN² + MN²)) + MN²
BN² = AB² - AN²
BN² = AB² - (AB - (BC/2))²
BN² = AB² - (AB² - AB(BC/2) + (BC/2)²)
BN² = AB(BC/2) - (BC/2)²
BN² = (BC/2)(AB - (BC/2))

Since BN = NC, we have:

BC² = 4BN² = 2BC(AB - (BC/2))
BC² = 2ABC - BC²
2BC² = 2ABC
BC = AB = 8

Now, let's solve for AN:

AN = AB - BN = AB - (BC/2) = 8 - 4 = 4

Now, let's solve for AM:

AM² = AN² + MN² = 4² + 2² = 20
AM = √20 = 2√5

Now, let's solve for AC:

AC² = AM² + MC²
AC² = AM² + (BC - BN)²
AC² = AM² + (BC/2)²
AC² = (2√5)² + (8/2)²
AC² = 20 + 16
AC² = 36
AC = √36 = 6

Therefore, the length of AC is 6.

First, let us examine the diagram. We see a right-angled triangle, with sides labelled 'a', 'b', and 'c'.  The problem asks us to find the cosine of angle A, denoted as 'cosA'.

Now, recall the fundamental trigonometric ratios:

* **Sine (sin):**  Opposite side / Hypotenuse
* **Cosine (cos):** Adjacent side / Hypotenuse
* **Tangent (tan):** Opposite side / Adjacent side

In our triangle, angle A is the focus.  The side adjacent to angle A is 'b', and the hypotenuse is 'c'.  Therefore, to find cosA, we apply the cosine formula:

**cosA = Adjacent side / Hypotenuse = b / c**

We are given that b = 48 and c = 50.  Substituting these values into the formula:

Let's break it down:

1. **Visualize the Problem:** Imagine a line drawn from the center of the circle (point O) perpendicular to the chord (AB). This line will bisect the chord, creating two equal segments.  Let's call the midpoint of the chord 'M'.

2. **The Pythagorean Theorem:** We now have a right triangle, OMA, where:
    - OA is the radius of the circle (5 units).
    - AM is half the length of the chord (8/2 = 4 units).

First, we must understand the properties of tangents.  A tangent line touches a circle at exactly one point.  The line segment connecting the center of the circle to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line.  Therefore, ∠OAP and ∠OBP are both right angles.

Now, let's examine the triangle PAB.  We know that ∠P = 50°.  Since the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180°, we can calculate the other two angles:

∠PAB + ∠PBA + ∠P = 180°
∠PAB + ∠PBA = 180° - ∠P = 180° - 50° = 130°

Since ∠OAP and ∠OBP are right angles, we have:

∠PAB = 90° - ∠OAB
∠PBA = 90° - ∠OBA

Substituting these into the previous equation:

(90° - ∠OAB) + (90° - ∠OBA) = 130°
∠OAB + ∠OBA = 50°

Now, let's focus on triangle OAB.  Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal in length.  Therefore, triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle, and ∠OAB = ∠OBA.

Substituting this into the previous equation:

∠OAB + ∠OAB = 50°
2∠OAB = 50°
∠OAB = 25°

Finally, let's consider triangle ACB.  We know that AC is the diameter of the circle, so ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the entire circle.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.  Since the intercepted arc is the entire circle, its measure is 360°.  Therefore:

∠ACB = 1/2 * 360° = 180°

However, we must subtract the angle ∠OAB from this to find the actual measure of ∠ACB:

∠ACB = 180° - ∠OAB = 180° - 25° = 155°

The key to solving this lies in understanding the properties of a rhombus.  A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles.  This means that the diagonals divide the rhombus into four congruent right-angled triangles.

Now, let's examine the information given. We know that one diagonal is twice as long as the other.  Let's denote the shorter diagonal as 'd' and the longer diagonal as '2d'.

The area of a rhombus is calculated by half the product of its diagonals.  Therefore, we can express this mathematically as:

Area = (1/2) * d * 2d = d²

We are given that the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters.  Substituting this into our equation, we get:

169 = d²

To find the value of 'd', we simply take the square root of both sides:

√169 = √d²

13 = d

Therefore, the shorter diagonal (d) is 13 millimeters.

1. **The Pythagorean Theorem:** This fundamental theorem of geometry states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We can express this mathematically as:  a² + b² = c²  where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the two shorter sides, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.

2. **Applying the Theorem:**  In our diagram, we know the area of the square with side length 8 is 8² = 64.  This represents the square of one of the shorter sides of the right triangle.  Similarly, the area of the square with side length 14 is 14² = 196, representing the square of the hypotenuse.

3. **Finding the Missing Side:**  Let's call the side length of the square labeled ""A"" as 'x'.  We can now apply the Pythagorean theorem:  x² + 64 = 196

Fear not, Watson, for this is a simple matter of applying the principles of geometry.  Let us begin by drawing a line segment from point O, the center of the circle, to point C.  This line segment is a radius of the circle, and therefore has a length of 2.

Now, consider triangle OAC.  We know that angle OAC is a right angle, as it is formed by a radius and a tangent to the circle.  We also know that angle C is 30 degrees.  Therefore, angle OCA must be 60 degrees, as the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees.

This means that triangle OAC is a 30-60-90 triangle, a special type of right triangle with specific side ratios.  In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is the square root of 3 times the length of the shorter leg.

Now, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Rotation:** When we rotate triangle ABC 90 degrees clockwise around point A, we essentially shift the triangle while keeping point A fixed.  This means that angle BAC remains unchanged, and the sides AB and AC are rotated 90 degrees.

2. **Identifying Key Angles:**  Since angle BAC is 90 degrees, and we rotate the triangle by 90 degrees, angle B'AC' is also 90 degrees.  Furthermore, angle CC'B' is given as 32 degrees.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Observe the figure, Watson. We are presented with a quadrilateral, a four-sided shape.  The key to solving this lies in understanding the properties of quadrilaterals, particularly the sum of their interior angles.

**The Sum of Interior Angles**

Every quadrilateral, regardless of its shape, has a total of 360 degrees in its interior angles.  This is a fundamental principle of geometry.  We can express this mathematically as:

An isosceles trapezoid has two important properties that will help us:

∠J + ∠K + ∠J + ∠M = 360°

Substituting ∠M = 80°:

2∠J + ∠K + 80° = 360°
```

Combining like terms:

2∠J + ∠K = 280°

Now, we need to find ∠J.  Since JK and ML are parallel, we can use the fact that alternate interior angles are equal.  This means ∠J = ∠L.  Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

First, we must recognize that quadrilateral ABCD is a right trapezoid.  This is because it has two right angles at points B and C, and one pair of parallel sides.

Now, let's recall a fundamental principle of geometry: the sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.  Therefore, we can write the following equation:

$m \angle A + m \angle B + m \angle C + m \angle D = 360^\circ$

We know that $m \angle B = m \angle C = 90^\circ$ because they are right angles.  We also know that $m \angle D = x^\circ$ and $m \angle A = 3x^\circ$.  Substituting these values into our equation, we get:

$3x^\circ + 90^\circ + 90^\circ + x^\circ = 360^\circ$

Combining like terms, we have:

$4x^\circ + 180^\circ = 360^\circ$

Subtracting $180^\circ$ from both sides, we get:

$4x^\circ = 180^\circ$

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find:

$x^\circ = 45^\circ$

Therefore, $m \angle A = 3x^\circ = 3(45^\circ) = \boxed{135^\circ}$.

First, we must understand the given information.  The diagram shows two parallel lines, AB and CD, intersected by a transversal line CF.  We are also given that BD is perpendicular to CF, meaning it forms a right angle at point B.  Finally, we know that angle ABF is 35 degrees.

Now, let's apply our knowledge of geometry.  Since AB and CD are parallel lines, we know that alternate interior angles are equal.  Therefore, angle BDC is equal to angle ABF, which is 35 degrees.

However, we also know that angle BDC is part of a right triangle, BDC.  The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.  Therefore, we can calculate angle BDC as follows:

Angle BDC + Angle CBD + Angle BCD = 180 degrees

Since angle CBD is a right angle (90 degrees), we have:

Angle BDC + 90 degrees + Angle BCD = 180 degrees

Angle BDC + Angle BCD = 90 degrees

We already know that angle BDC is 35 degrees.  Therefore:

35 degrees + Angle BCD = 90 degrees

Angle BCD = 90 degrees - 35 degrees

Angle BCD = 55 degrees

Therefore, the measure of angle BDC is **35 degrees**.

Next, we observe that ∠CAB is an inscribed angle of the circle, subtended by the same arc as ∠BOC.  A fundamental theorem in geometry states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc.

In our case, we are interested in the tangent of angle M.  The side opposite angle M is PN, which has a length of 15. The side adjacent to angle M is NM, which has a length of 36.

Therefore, the tangent of angle M, or tan M, is:

tan M = (opposite side) / (adjacent side) = 15 / 36

A simple geometric shape, yet it holds the key to unlocking this mystery. Fear not, for I shall guide you through the solution with the clarity of a London fog.

First, let us recall the formula for the area of a parallelogram:

**Area = Base x Height**

In our case, we can use AB as the base, which is 6.0. Now, we need to find the height.

Observe that the height of the parallelogram is the perpendicular distance from point D to line AB.  We can construct a perpendicular line from D to AB, intersecting AB at point E.  This creates a right triangle, DBE.

Now, we know that ∠B = 30.0 degrees.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find ∠DBE:

∠DBE = 180 - 90 - 30 = 60 degrees

Therefore, triangle DBE is a 30-60-90 right triangle.  In such a triangle, the sides have a specific ratio:

* The hypotenuse (DB) is twice the length of the shorter leg (BE).
* The longer leg (DE) is √3 times the length of the shorter leg (BE).

We know that BC = 9.0, and since BC is parallel to AD, we also know that AD = 9.0.  Therefore, DB = AD - AB = 9.0 - 6.0 = 3.0.

Now, we can find BE:

BE = DB / 2 = 3.0 / 2 = 1.5

And finally, we can find the height, DE:

DE = BE * √3 = 1.5 * √3 = 1.5√3

Now that we have the base (AB = 6.0) and the height (DE = 1.5√3), we can calculate the area of the parallelogram:

Area = Base x Height = 6.0 x 1.5√3 = 9√3

Therefore, the area of parallelogram ABCD is **9√3**.

First, we must recognize that the angles within a circle hold a special relationship.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In this case, ∠ABC intercepts arc AC, and since ∠ABC is 60 degrees, arc AC must be 120 degrees.

Now, let's focus on the relationship between ∠CDE and arc AC.  ∠CDE is an exterior angle of triangle ADC, and its measure is equal to the sum of the measures of the two remote interior angles, ∠DAC and ∠ACD.

Since ∠DAC intercepts arc DC, and ∠ACD intercepts arc AD, we can express the measure of ∠CDE as:

∠CDE = 1/2 (arc DC) + 1/2 (arc AD)

Notice that arc DC and arc AD together make up the entire circle, which has 360 degrees.  Therefore:

∠CDE = 1/2 (360 degrees) = 180 degrees

However, we must remember that ∠CDE is an exterior angle, and its measure is the difference between the measure of the intercepted arc and the measure of the adjacent arc.  In this case, the intercepted arc is the entire circle (360 degrees), and the adjacent arc is arc AC (120 degrees).

Therefore, the final measure of ∠CDE is:

∠CDE = 360 degrees - 120 degrees = 240 degrees

375,Find the length of $AC$ in the isosceles triangle ABC. ,7,"Ah, Watson, this is a most intriguing puzzle!  Let us dissect it with our usual precision.

First, we must recognize that triangle ABC is isosceles. This means that two of its sides are equal in length.  We are given the lengths of AB and BC as:

* AB = 9x - 1
* BC = 5x - 0.5

Since the triangle is isosceles, we know that either AB = AC or BC = AC.  Let's assume AB = AC.  This gives us:

* AC = 9x - 1

Now, we need to find the value of x.  We can do this by using the fact that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.  Let's apply this to our triangle:

* AB + BC > AC
* (9x - 1) + (5x - 0.5) > (9x - 1)

Simplifying the inequality:

* 14x - 1.5 > 9x - 1
* 5x > 0.5
* x > 0.1

Therefore, the value of x must be greater than 0.1.  

Now, we can substitute this value of x back into our equation for AC:

* AC = 9x - 1
* AC = 9(0.1) - 1
* AC = 0.9 - 1
* AC = -0.1

However, a length cannot be negative.  This means our initial assumption that AB = AC was incorrect.  Therefore, we must conclude that BC = AC.  

Let's substitute this into our equation for AC:

* AC = 5x - 0.5

Now, we can substitute the value of x we found earlier (x > 0.1) into this equation.  Since we don't have a specific value for x, we can only express the length of AC in terms of x:

* AC = 5x - 0.5

Therefore, the length of AC is **5x - 0.5**, where x is any value greater than 0.1.

We are given the areas of triangles A'BC and AB'C, which are 10 and 4, respectively.  Our goal is to find the area of triangle ABC'.

Now, let's recall some fundamental geometric principles.  The area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula:

```
Area = (√3 / 4) * side²
```

Where 'side' represents the length of a side of the equilateral triangle.

Since we know the areas of triangles A'BC and AB'C, we can use this formula to find the lengths of their sides:

```
Area of A'BC = 10 = (√3 / 4) * BC²
BC² = (40 / √3)
BC = √(40 / √3)

Area of AB'C = 4 = (√3 / 4) * AC²
AC² = (16 / √3)
AC = √(16 / √3)

EF intersects AB at point C, and we have drawn a line segment OF.  We are given that ∠AOF = 40°.  Our goal is to find the measure of ∠F.

Now, let's apply our knowledge of geometry.  Since AB is a diameter, we know that ∠AEB is a right angle (90°).  This is because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle.

Next, we can use the fact that E is the midpoint of FEB.  This means that ∠FEB = 2∠FE.

Now, let's focus on triangle AOF.  We know that ∠AOF = 40°.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, we can find ∠OAF:

∠OAF = 180° - ∠AOF - ∠FOA = 180° - 40° - 90° = 50°

Now, let's consider triangle EFC.  We know that ∠FEC = ∠FE + ∠ECF.  We also know that ∠ECF = ∠OAF (because they are alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines).  Therefore:

∠FEC = ∠FE + ∠OAF = ∠FE + 50°

Finally, let's look at triangle FEB.  We know that ∠FEB = 2∠FE.  We also know that ∠FEC = ∠FE + 50°.  Therefore:

∠FEB = ∠FEC + ∠CEB = (∠FE + 50°) + 90° = ∠FE + 140°

Since ∠FEB = 2∠FE, we can set up an equation:

Therefore, the measure of ∠F is **140°**.

First, we must recognize that the problem involves a circle and its chords.  The key to unlocking this mystery lies in understanding the relationships between angles, chords, and the center of the circle.

**Step 1:  Identifying Key Relationships**

* **Central Angle:**  ∠EOD is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle (O).
* **Inscribed Angle:** ∠DCF is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex lies on the circle's circumference.
* **Chord:**  EF is a chord, a line segment connecting two points on the circle's circumference.

**Step 2:  Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem**

The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In our case, ∠DCF intercepts arc DF.  Therefore:

This means arc DF measures 40°.

**Step 3:  Utilizing the Relationship Between Central and Inscribed Angles**

The problem presents us with a triangle ABC, where AD bisects angle BAC, and DE is perpendicular to AB. We are given DE = 3 and AC = 4, and we are tasked with finding the area of triangle ADC.

Fear not, Watson, for the solution lies in the application of a few fundamental geometric principles.

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the area of triangle ADC.  The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula:

Area = (1/2) * base * height

In triangle ADC, AD is the base, and DE is the height.  However, we only know the length of DE.  We need to find the length of AD.

**Step 2: Utilizing the Angle Bisector Theorem**

The angle bisector theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides.

In our triangle ABC, AD bisects angle BAC.  Therefore, according to the angle bisector theorem:

BD/DC = AB/AC

**Step 3: Finding the Length of AD**

We know AC = 4.  To find AD, we need to find BD and DC.  Let's consider triangle ADE.  It is a right-angled triangle with DE = 3 and AE as the hypotenuse.  Using the Pythagorean theorem:

AE² = DE² + AD²

AE² = 3² + AD²

AE² = 9 + AD²

Now, let's consider triangle ABC.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem again:

AB² = AC² + BC²

AB² = 4² + BC²

AB² = 16 + BC²

Since BD + DC = BC, we can substitute BC with BD + DC in the above equation:

AB² = 16 + (BD + DC)²

Now, we have two equations with two unknowns (AB and AD).  We can solve for AD by substituting the value of AB from the second equation into the first equation.  However, we need to find BD and DC first.

**Step 4: Finding BD and DC**

We know BD/DC = AB/AC.  We can rewrite this as:

BD = (AB/AC) * DC

Substituting the value of AB from the equation AB² = 16 + (BD + DC)²:

BD = (√(16 + (BD + DC)²)/4) * DC

Simplifying the equation:

4BD = √(16 + (BD + DC)²) * DC

Squaring both sides:

16BD² = (16 + (BD + DC)²) * DC²

Expanding the equation:

16BD² = 16DC² + (BD + DC)² * DC²

Simplifying further:

16BD² = 16DC² + BD² * DC² + 2BD * DC³ + DC⁴

Rearranging the terms:

BD² * DC² + 2BD * DC³ + DC⁴ - 16BD² + 16DC² = 0

This is a quadratic equation in BD.  We can solve for BD using the quadratic formula:

First, let us examine the given information. We know that ∠D = 35° and ∠AEC = 105°.  Our goal is to find ∠C.

Now, observe that ∠AEC and ∠BED are vertically opposite angles.  Vertically opposite angles are always equal, so ∠BED = ∠AEC = 105°.

Next, consider the triangle BED.  The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180°.  Therefore, we can write:

∠BED + ∠BDE + ∠DBE = 180°

Substituting the known values:

105° + 35° + ∠DBE = 180°

Solving for ∠DBE:

∠DBE = 180° - 105° - 35° = 40°

Now, let's focus on the cyclic quadrilateral ABCD.  A cyclic quadrilateral is a quadrilateral whose vertices all lie on a circle.  A key property of cyclic quadrilaterals is that the opposite angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180°.

Therefore, we have:

∠C + ∠A = 180°

We also know that ∠A = ∠DBE (angles subtended by the same arc).  Therefore:

∠C + ∠DBE = 180°

Substituting the value of ∠DBE:

∠C + 40° = 180°

Solving for ∠C:

∠C = 180° - 40° = 140°

Thus, Watson, we have solved the mathematical riddle!  ∠C = 140°.  This knowledge may be the key to unlocking the mystery of this case.  Let us proceed with our investigation, armed with this newfound insight.

816,"Find x. Round to the nearest tenth, if necessary.",3,"Ah, Watson, this is a most intriguing puzzle!  The criminal has left us a mathematical riddle, but fear not, for we shall unravel it with the same precision we apply to any other case.

Observe, Watson, the diagram. We have a circle with a chord of length 24, and two secants intersecting outside the circle.  The lengths of the segments of the secants are given as 9, x, 12.25, and 2x.  Our task is to find the value of x.

Now, let us recall a fundamental theorem of geometry, known as the **Intersecting Secant Theorem**. This theorem states that when two secants intersect outside a circle, the product of the lengths of one secant and its external segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the other secant and its external segment.

In our case, we can apply this theorem as follows:

* **Secant 1:**  Length = 9 + x, External segment = 9
* **Secant 2:** Length = 12.25 + 2x, External segment = 12.25

Therefore, according to the Intersecting Secant Theorem:

(9 + x) * 9 = (12.25 + 2x) * 12.25

Now, Watson, we have a simple algebraic equation. Let us solve for x:

81 + 9x = 150.0625 + 24.5x

15.5x = -69.0625

x = -69.0625 / 15.5

x ≈ -4.46

However, Watson, we must be cautious.  A negative length is nonsensical in this context.  This indicates that our initial assumption about the position of the secants might be incorrect.  It is possible that the secant with length 12.25 + 2x actually intersects the circle *inside* the circle, making the external segment 2x.

Let's re-apply the Intersecting Secant Theorem with this revised assumption:

* **Secant 1:**  Length = 9 + x, External segment = 9
* **Secant 2:** Length = 12.25 + 2x, External segment = 2x

Therefore:

(9 + x) * 9 = (12.25 + 2x) * 2x

81 + 9x = 24.5x + 4x²

4x² + 15.5x - 81 = 0

Now, we have a quadratic equation.  We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

Where a = 4, b = 15.5, and c = -81

x = (-15.5 ± √(15.5² - 4 * 4 * -81)) / (2 * 4)

x = (-15.5 ± √(1260.25 + 1296)) / 8

x = (-15.5 ± √2556.25) / 8

x = (-15.5 ± 50.56) / 8

This gives us two possible solutions:

x₁ = (-15.5 + 50.56) / 8 ≈ 4.45

x₂ = (-15.5 - 50.56) / 8 ≈ -8.26

Again, we discard the negative solution.  Therefore, the correct value of x is approximately **4.45**.

First, we must understand the fundamental principles at play.  The angle inscribed in a circle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.  In simpler terms, if you have a triangle inside a circle, where two of the triangle's points touch the circle's edge, the angle formed by those two points is half the angle formed by the center of the circle and those same two points.

Now, let's apply this to our problem.  We are given that ∠ACB = 25°.  This angle is inscribed in the circle, subtending arc AB.  Therefore, the central angle ∠AOB, which also subtends arc AB, is twice the measure of ∠ACB.

Thus, ∠AOB = 2 * ∠ACB = 2 * 25° = 50°.

Next, we must recognize that ∠BAO is a part of triangle AOB.  The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180°.  Therefore, we can calculate ∠BAO as follows:

∠BAO = 180° - ∠AOB - ∠ABO

Now, we need to determine ∠ABO.  Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal in length.  This makes triangle AOB an isosceles triangle, meaning ∠ABO = ∠BAO.

Substituting this knowledge into our equation, we get:

∠BAO = 180° - ∠AOB - ∠BAO

Solving for ∠BAO:

2 * ∠BAO = 180° - ∠AOB

∠BAO = (180° - ∠AOB) / 2

Plugging in the value of ∠AOB:

∠BAO = (180° - 50°) / 2

∠BAO = 130° / 2

∠BAO = 65°

Therefore, the degree of ∠BAO is 65°.  This, Watson, is the key to unlocking the mystery!  The perpetrator must have left this mathematical clue as a signpost, a beacon guiding us towards the truth.  Let us now proceed with this newfound knowledge and unravel the case!

First, we must recognize that the line segment DC is a tangent to the circle, and the line segment AC is a secant.  This means that the angle formed by the tangent and the secant, ∠D, is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

Now, let's break down the intercepted arcs.  Arc AC is the larger arc, and arc BC is the smaller arc.  Since AB is the diameter, arc AB is a semicircle, measuring 180 degrees.  Therefore, arc AC is 180 degrees + ∠A, which is 180 degrees + 25 degrees = 205 degrees.  Arc BC is 180 degrees - ∠A, which is 180 degrees - 25 degrees = 155 degrees.

Finally, we can calculate ∠D:

∠D = (1/2) * (arc AC - arc BC)
∠D = (1/2) * (205 degrees - 155 degrees)
∠D = (1/2) * 50 degrees
∠D = 25 degrees

Therefore, ∠D = 25 degrees.

First, we must recognize that line segment $CE$ is a chord of the circle, and line segment $AB$ is a diameter.  We know that a diameter bisects a chord, meaning it cuts the chord in half.  Therefore, $CD=DE=13.5/2=6.75$.

Now, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $BD$.  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In this case, we have a right triangle $BDC$, where $BC$ is the hypotenuse, $BD$ is one leg, and $CD$ is the other leg.

We know that $BC$ is the radius of the circle, which is half the diameter, or $AB/2=8/2=4$.  We also know that $CD=6.75$.  Therefore, we can plug these values into the Pythagorean Theorem:

$BC^2=BD^2+CD^2$

$4^2=BD^2+6.75^2$

$16=BD^2+45.5625$

$BD^2=16-45.5625=-29.5625$

First, we must understand the given information. We know that point O is the center of the circle, and points A, B, and C lie on the circumference.  We are also given that line AO is parallel to line BC, and the angle AOB measures 40 degrees.  Our goal is to find the measure of angle OAC.

Now, let's apply our deductive reasoning. Since AO is parallel to BC, we can deduce that angle OAC is equal to angle OCB. This is because they are alternate interior angles formed by a transversal (line AC) intersecting two parallel lines.

Next, we must consider the properties of angles within a circle.  Angle AOB is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle.  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex lies on the circumference.  A crucial theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.

Therefore, angle ACB is half the measure of angle AOB, which is 40 degrees.  So, angle ACB measures 20 degrees.

Now, we can apply the angle sum property of triangles.  The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.  In triangle OAC, we know that angle OAC is equal to angle OCB, and we have just determined that angle ACB measures 20 degrees.

Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Angle OAC + Angle OCB + Angle ACB = 180 degrees

Since angle OAC = angle OCB, we can simplify this to:

2 * Angle OAC + 20 degrees = 180 degrees

Solving for angle OAC, we get:

2 * Angle OAC = 160 degrees

Angle OAC = 80 degrees

Thus, the degree of angle OAC is 80 degrees.

Now, let's focus on the triangle AEF.  Since E and F are midpoints, AE = AB/2 = 5/2 and AF = AD/2 = 5/2.  We can see that triangle AEF is an isosceles triangle, with AE = AF.

The key to solving this lies in recognizing that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.  Therefore, angle AOE is a right angle.

Now, consider triangle AOE.  We know AO = AC/2 = 6/2 = 3.  We also know AE = 5/2.  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of OE:

OE² = AE² - AO² = (5/2)² - 3² = 1/4

Now, let's employ a bit of elementary geometry.  Consider triangle AMB.  Since ∠B = 90°, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem:

AM² = AB² + BM²

Similarly, for triangle AND:

AN² = AD² + DN²

The perimeter of triangle AMN is given by:

P = AM + MN + AN

Our goal is to minimize this perimeter.  To do so, we can use the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.

Applying this to triangle AMN, we have:

AM + MN > AN
AM + AN > MN
MN + AN > AM

Now, let's substitute the expressions for AM and AN from the Pythagorean theorem:

√(AB² + BM²) + √(AD² + DN²) > MN
√(AB² + BM²) + MN > √(AD² + DN²)
MN + √(AD² + DN²) > √(AB² + BM²)

To minimize the perimeter, we need to minimize each of these inequalities.  This can be achieved by minimizing the lengths of BM and DN.

Observe that BM and DN are the perpendicular distances from points M and N to lines AB and AD respectively.  Therefore, to minimize BM and DN, we must place points M and N such that they are the feet of the perpendiculars drawn from A to BC and AD respectively.

In other words, AM and AN are the altitudes of triangles AMB and AND.  This ensures that BM and DN are minimized, thereby minimizing the perimeter of triangle AMN.

Now, let's consider the angles ∠AMN and ∠ANM.  Since AM and AN are altitudes, we have:

∠AMB = ∠AND = 90°

Therefore, in quadrilateral AMND, we have:

∠AMN + ∠ANM + ∠MAN + ∠ADN = 360°

Substituting ∠MAN = 120° and ∠ADN = 90°, we get:

∠AMN + ∠ANM + 120° + 90° = 360°

Solving for ∠AMN + ∠ANM, we obtain:

Now, let's consider triangle CGF.  We know that angle CGF is 88 degrees.  Also, angle GCF is equal to angle ACD, which we defined as x.  Therefore, we can find angle FGC using the angle sum property of triangles:

Angle CGF + Angle GCF + Angle FGC = 180 degrees

Substituting the known values:

88 degrees + x + Angle FGC = 180 degrees

Simplifying the equation:

Angle FGC = 92 degrees - x

Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, we know that angle E is equal to angle B.  Therefore, we need to find angle B.

Looking back at triangle ABC, we can use the fact that the angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.  Angle B and angle FGC are on a straight line, so:

Angle B + Angle FGC = 180 degrees

Substituting the value we found for angle FGC:

Angle B + (92 degrees - x) = 180 degrees

Simplifying the equation:

Angle B = 88 degrees + x

Now, we can substitute this value for angle B back into the equation we derived earlier for triangle ABC:

(88 degrees + x) + 2x = 158 degrees

Simplifying the equation:

3x = 70 degrees

Therefore, x = 23.33 degrees.

Finally, we can find angle E, which is equal to angle B:

Angle E = 88 degrees + x = 88 degrees + 23.33 degrees = 111.33 degrees.

Thus, the measure of angle E is 111.33 degrees.  This solution, Watson, may hold the key to unraveling the mystery at hand.  Let us proceed with this knowledge and see what further deductions we can make.

First, we must understand the fundamental principles at play.  The diagram depicts a circle with a diameter AB, and points C and D lying on the circumference.  The angle BCD is given as 25 degrees, and we are tasked with finding the measure of angle AOD.

Now, observe that angle AOD is an inscribed angle of the circle, subtended by the arc AD.  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share a common endpoint on the circle's circumference.  A fundamental theorem in geometry states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

Therefore, to find the measure of angle AOD, we must first determine the measure of arc AD.  Notice that arc AD is the difference between the entire circumference of the circle and arc BC.  Since AB is a diameter, arc AB is a semicircle, measuring 180 degrees.

Now, let's focus on triangle BCD.  We know that angle BCD is 25 degrees.  Since the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we can find the measure of angle CBD:

```
∠CBD = 180° - ∠BCD - ∠BDC
```

However, we don't know the measure of angle BDC.  But, we can use another crucial geometric principle: the inscribed angle theorem.  Angle BDC is an inscribed angle subtended by arc BC.  Therefore, its measure is half the measure of arc BC.

Let's denote the measure of arc BC as x.  Then, we have:

```
∠BDC = x/2
```

Substituting this into our equation for angle CBD, we get:

```
∠CBD = 180° - 25° - x/2
```

Simplifying:

```
∠CBD = 155° - x/2
```

Now, we can use the fact that angles on a straight line sum to 180 degrees.  Angle CBD and angle ABD are angles on a straight line, so:

```
∠ABD + ∠CBD = 180°
```

Substituting the value we found for angle CBD:

```
∠ABD + (155° - x/2) = 180°
```

Simplifying:

```
∠ABD = 25° + x/2
```

Now, we can use the inscribed angle theorem again.  Angle ABD is an inscribed angle subtended by arc AD.  Therefore:

```
∠ABD = (arc AD)/2
```

Substituting the value we found for angle ABD:

```
25° + x/2 = (arc AD)/2
```

Multiplying both sides by 2:

```
50° + x = arc AD
```

We know that arc AB is 180 degrees, and arc AD is 50° + x.  Therefore:

```
arc BC = arc AB - arc AD
```

Substituting:

```
x = 180° - (50° + x)
```

Simplifying:

```
x = 65°
```

Now that we know the measure of arc BC, we can find the measure of arc AD:

```
arc AD = 50° + x = 50° + 65° = 115°
```

Finally, we can use the inscribed angle theorem one last time to find the measure of angle AOD:

```
∠AOD = (arc AD)/2 = 115°/2 = 57.5°
```

Therefore, Watson, the measure of angle AOD is 57.5 degrees.  This crucial piece of information may be the key to unlocking the mystery that has brought us here.  Let us proceed with our investigation, armed with this newfound knowledge!

First, we must understand the concept of symmetry.  When two points are symmetrical with respect to a line, it means that the line acts as a mirror, reflecting one point onto the other.  

Now, let's examine the given information.  We know that A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP.  This implies that line MP bisects line AB, meaning it divides line AB into two equal parts.  Similarly, line NQ bisects line AC.

Since ∠BAC = 110°, we can deduce that ∠BAM = ∠CAM = 110°/2 = 55°.

Now, let's focus on triangle AMP.  We know that ∠AMP = 90° (because MP is the perpendicular bisector of AB).  Therefore, ∠MAP = 180° - ∠AMP - ∠BAM = 180° - 90° - 55° = 35°.

Similarly, in triangle ANQ, we have ∠ANQ = 90° and ∠NAQ = 35°.

Finally, let's consider triangle PAQ.  We know that ∠PAQ = 180° - ∠MAP - ∠NAQ = 180° - 35° - 35° = 110°.

Therefore, the size of ∠PAQ is **110°**.

Now, let's apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  We can express this mathematically as:

$\angle GJH = \frac{1}{2} \stackrel{\frown}{GH}$

Similarly,

$\angle KHL = \frac{1}{2} \stackrel{\frown}{GH}$

Since $\angle GJH$ and $\angle KHL$ are congruent, we can set their measures equal to each other:

$\angle GJH = \angle KHL$

1. Add $27^\circ$ to both sides of the equation:
   $83^\circ + 27^\circ = (2x - 27)^\circ + 27^\circ$

2. Simplify:

It appears we have a triangle, labelled QRS, with sides of varying lengths expressed as algebraic expressions.  The key to unlocking this mystery lies in the fact that the triangle is equilateral.  This means all three sides are equal in length.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Equilateral Triangle:**  An equilateral triangle has all sides equal. Therefore, we can set the expressions for the sides equal to each other:
   *  $4x = 2x + 1$
   *  $4x = 6x - 1$

2. **Solving for x:**  Now we have two equations with one unknown, 'x'.  Let's solve for 'x' in each equation:
   *  Equation 1:  $4x = 2x + 1$
      *  Subtract 2x from both sides:  $2x = 1$
      *  Divide both sides by 2:  $x = \frac{1}{2}$
   *  Equation 2:  $4x = 6x - 1$
      *  Subtract 4x from both sides:  $0 = 2x - 1$
      *  Add 1 to both sides:  $1 = 2x$

First, we must recognize that the lines l1 and l2 are parallel. This is a crucial piece of information, as it tells us that the angles formed by the intersection of the triangle and these lines are related.

Now, let's focus on the angles within the triangle. We know that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.  Therefore, we can deduce the following:

* **Angle 1 + Angle 2 + 30 degrees = 180 degrees**

We are given that Angle 1 is 76 degrees.  Substituting this into our equation, we get:

* **76 degrees + Angle 2 + 30 degrees = 180 degrees**

Combining like terms, we have:

* **Angle 2 + 106 degrees = 180 degrees**

First, we must recognize the key geometric principle at play here: **the Inscribed Angle Theorem**. This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

Observe the diagram, Watson. The angle marked 3x° is an inscribed angle, intercepting the arc formed by the two chords within the circle.  The angle marked (4x + 50)° is also an inscribed angle, intercepting the same arc.

Therefore, according to the Inscribed Angle Theorem:

* 3x° = (1/2) * (measure of intercepted arc)
* (4x + 50)° = (1/2) * (measure of intercepted arc)

Since both angles intercept the same arc, their measures are equal:

3x° = (4x + 50)°

Now, we can solve for x:

* 3x = 4x + 50
* -x = 50
* x = -50

However, Watson, we must be cautious!  Angles cannot have negative measures.  This indicates that our initial assumption about the angles being inscribed angles is incorrect.  Let's re-examine the diagram.

Notice that the angle marked 3x° appears to be formed by a tangent line and a chord.  This suggests that it is a **tangent-chord angle**.  The measure of a tangent-chord angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

Now, let's apply this knowledge:

* 3x° = (1/2) * (measure of intercepted arc)

The intercepted arc is the same one as before, which is also intercepted by the inscribed angle (4x + 50)°.  Therefore:

* 3x° = (1/2) * (4x + 50)°

Solving for x:

* 3x = 2x + 25

512,What is the y coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle of uniform areal density shown in Figure 9-C?,0.24,"Ah, Watson, this is a most intriguing puzzle!  The key to solving this lies in understanding the concept of the center of mass.  The center of mass of an object is the point where the entire mass of the object can be considered to be concentrated.  For a symmetrical object like our triangle, the center of mass lies along the line of symmetry.

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. **Divide the triangle:** Imagine dividing the triangle into an infinite number of infinitesimally small horizontal strips. Each strip has a small mass, dm.

2. **Center of mass of each strip:** The center of mass of each strip lies at its midpoint.  The y-coordinate of the midpoint of each strip is simply half its height.

3. **Integration:** To find the overall center of mass, we need to sum up the contributions of all these strips.  This is where integration comes in.  We'll integrate the y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip, multiplied by its mass, over the entire height of the triangle.

4. **Formula:** The formula for the y-coordinate of the center of mass (y_cm) is:

   y_cm = (∫ y * dm) / (∫ dm)

   Where:
   - y is the y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip
   - dm is the mass of each strip
   - ∫ represents integration

5. **Simplifying the formula:**  Since the triangle has uniform areal density, the mass of each strip is proportional to its area.  The area of each strip is approximately equal to its width (dx) multiplied by its height (y).  Therefore, dm = k * y * dx, where k is a constant of proportionality.

   Substituting this into the formula, we get:

   y_cm = (∫ y * k * y * dx) / (∫ k * y * dx)

   y_cm = (k * ∫ y^2 * dx) / (k * ∫ y * dx)

   y_cm = (∫ y^2 * dx) / (∫ y * dx)

6. **Finding the limits of integration:**  The triangle extends from y = 0 to y = a.  We need to express the limits of integration in terms of x.  Since the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, the equation of the line forming its hypotenuse is y = -x + a.  Solving for x, we get x = a - y.  Therefore, the limits of integration are x = 0 (when y = a) and x = a (when y = 0).

7. **Performing the integration:**  Now, we can perform the integration:

   y_cm = (∫ (a - x)^2 * dx) / (∫ (a - x) * dx)

   y_cm = (∫ (a^2 - 2ax + x^2) * dx) / (∫ (a - x) * dx)

   y_cm = [(a^2 * x - ax^2 + (x^3)/3) |_0^a] / [(ax - (x^2)/2) |_0^a]

   y_cm = [(a^3 - a^3 + (a^3)/3) - (0)] / [(a^2 - (a^2)/2) - (0)]

   y_cm = [(a^3)/3] / [(a^2)/2]

   y_cm = (2/3) * a

But fear not, my dear Watson, for with a bit of logic and a touch of mathematical finesse, we shall unravel this mystery.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **The Infinite Loop:** Imagine we cut the circuit at a point between two resistors.  The remaining circuit, extending infinitely to the right, will have the same resistance as the original circuit.  This is because the circuit is infinite, and removing a finite number of resistors doesn't change its fundamental nature.

2. **Simplifying the Circuit:**  Let's focus on the portion of the circuit to the right of the cut.  We see three resistors in parallel: one with resistance R, and two others in series with resistance R each (totaling 2R).  The equivalent resistance of these three parallel resistors can be calculated using the formula:

   1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/2R + 1/R = 5/2R

   Therefore, R_parallel = 2R/5

3. **The Recursive Nature:**  Now, the resistance of the entire circuit to the right of the cut is R_parallel + R (the single resistor on the left of the cut).  But we know that this resistance is the same as the resistance of the original infinite circuit.  Let's call this resistance 'X'.  We can express this relationship as:

   X = R_parallel + R = 2R/5 + R

4. **Solving for X:**  Since R = 1, we can substitute and solve for X:

   X = 2/5 + 1 = 7/5

Therefore, the resistance between terminals a and b is **7/5 ohms**.

First, we must understand the relationship between the area of a square and its side length. The area of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself.  In mathematical terms, this is expressed as:

Now, let us apply our knowledge of geometry.  Since AB is parallel to CD, we can deduce that angle BAE is equal to angle CED.  This is a fundamental principle of parallel lines: corresponding angles are equal.

Next, we observe that angle BAE and angle ABE form a right angle, as BE is perpendicular to AF.  Therefore, we can calculate angle BAE as 90 degrees minus angle ABE, which is 90 degrees minus 65 degrees, resulting in 25 degrees.

Observe the diagram. We have four angles radiating from point C:  ∠NCR, ∠RCN, ∠NCL, and ∠LCM.  Their sum must equal 360 degrees.

Now, let's break down the given information:

* ∠NCL = (3x + 5)°
* ∠LCM = 60°

We are tasked with finding ∠NCL, which is (3x + 5)°.  To do this, we must first determine the value of 'x'.

Let's apply our principle of angles around a point:

(x - 1)° + 60° + (3x + 5)° + ∠NCR = 360°

Combining like terms, we get:

4x + 64° + ∠NCR = 360°

Now, we need to find ∠NCR.  Notice that ∠NCR and ∠RCN are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.

Therefore:

∠NCR + (x - 1)° = 180°

Solving for ∠NCR:

∠NCR = 180° - (x - 1)° = 181° - x

Substituting this value back into our previous equation:

4x + 64° + (181° - x) = 360°

Simplifying:

3x + 245° = 360°

Subtracting 245° from both sides:

3x = 115°

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 38.33° (approximately)

First, we must understand the properties of a regular hexagon.  A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles.  The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is 720 degrees.  Therefore, each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees (720 degrees / 6 sides = 120 degrees).

Now, let's focus on the triangle ABO.  We know that angle ABO is 120 degrees, as it is an interior angle of the hexagon.  We also know that angle BAO is half of angle ABO, as line AO bisects angle BAC.  Therefore, angle BAO is 60 degrees (120 degrees / 2 = 60 degrees).

Since the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, we can calculate angle AOB:

Angle AOB = 180 degrees - angle ABO - angle BAO
Angle AOB = 180 degrees - 120 degrees - 60 degrees
Angle AOB = 0 degrees

This means that line AO and line BO are coincident, forming a straight line.  Therefore, x, which represents angle ABO, is equal to 180 degrees.

Observe that the angles at points C and E are inscribed angles of the circle.  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords with its vertex on the circle's circumference.  A crucial theorem in geometry states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

The angle at point C intercepts the arc DE, and the angle at point E intercepts the arc CD.  Since the entire circle is 360 degrees, we can express the measure of arc DE as 360 degrees minus the measure of arc CD.

Therefore, we can write the following equations:

* Angle C = (1/2) * arc DE = (1/2) * (360 - arc CD) = 180 - (1/2) * arc CD
* Angle E = (1/2) * arc CD

We are given that Angle C = (5x - 12) degrees and Angle E = 3x degrees.  Substituting these values into our equations, we get:

First, we must recognize that the given equation, $\frac{IJ}{XJ}=\frac{HJ}{YJ}$, is a statement of the **Angle Bisector Theorem**. This theorem states that if a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the other two sides.

In our case, line segment $XJ$ bisects angle $WXJ$, as indicated by the equal angles on either side of the bisector.  Therefore, we can conclude that line segment $XJ$ divides the opposite side, $WZ$, into segments proportional to the other two sides, $WJ$ and $ZJ$.

Now, let's focus on the angles. We know that $m\angle WXJ = 130^\circ$.  Since $XJ$ bisects this angle, we have $m\angle WXJ = m\angle XJZ = 65^\circ$.

Furthermore, we are given that $m\angle WZG = 20^\circ$.  Since angles $WZG$ and $YZG$ form a linear pair (they are adjacent and their measures add up to $180^\circ$), we can calculate $m\angle YZG = 180^\circ - 20^\circ = 160^\circ$.

Finally, we can find $m\angle YIZ$.  Angles $YIZ$ and $YZG$ are supplementary angles (they add up to $180^\circ$).  Therefore, $m\angle YIZ = 180^\circ - 160^\circ = \boxed{20^\circ}$.

And there you have it, Watson!  The solution to this mathematical riddle is $20^\circ$.  This knowledge may prove invaluable in our pursuit of the truth.  Let us proceed with our investigation, armed with this newfound insight.

First, we must recall a fundamental principle of geometry: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In our case, $∠ABC$ is an inscribed angle intercepting arc $\widehat{ADC}$.  Therefore, we can write:

$$m∠ABC = \frac{1}{2} m\widehat{ADC}$$

We are given that $m∠ABC = 70°$, so:

$$70° = \frac{1}{2} y$$

Solving for $y$, we find:

$$y = 140°$$

Now, we know that the entire circle has a measure of $360°$.  Therefore, the measure of minor arc $\widehat{AC}$ is:

$$x = 360° - y = 360° - 140° = 220°$$

Thus, the measure of minor arc $\widehat{AC}$, or $x$, is $\boxed{220°}$.

First, we must recognize that the angles formed by a tangent line and a radius drawn to the point of tangency are always right angles. Therefore, ∠OBC and ∠OCD are both 90 degrees.

Next, we observe that ∠ACE and ∠ACB are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, ∠ACB = 180° - ∠ACE = 180° - 25° = 155°.

Now, let's focus on triangle ABC.  We know that ∠ABC = 90° (tangent-radius property) and ∠ACB = 155°.  The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180°, so ∠BAC = 180° - ∠ABC - ∠ACB = 180° - 90° - 155° = -65°.  However, angles cannot be negative, so we must adjust our thinking.

Remember, AB is the diameter of the circle, making ∠ACB an inscribed angle that intercepts the entire circle.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Since ∠ACB intercepts the entire circle, its measure is half the measure of the circle, which is 180°.  Therefore, ∠ACB = 180°/2 = 90°.

Now, we can correctly calculate ∠BAC: ∠BAC = 180° - ∠ABC - ∠ACB = 180° - 90° - 90° = 0°.

Finally, we can determine ∠D.  Since ∠BAC = 0° and ∠ACD = 90°, we have ∠D = ∠ACD - ∠BAC = 90° - 0° = 90°.

Therefore, the degree of ∠D is **90**.

737,Find the perimeter of the parallelogram.,78,"Ah, Watson, a most intriguing puzzle indeed!  Let us dissect this mathematical enigma with the precision of a surgeon.

First, we must recognize that the parallelogram is composed of two congruent triangles.  The base of each triangle is 23 feet, and the angle opposite the base is 60 degrees.  To find the perimeter of the parallelogram, we must first determine the length of the other two sides.

Now, let us delve into the realm of trigonometry.  The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.  In our case, the hypotenuse is 23 feet, and the angle is 60 degrees.  Therefore, we can write:

sin(60°) = opposite side / 23 feet

The sine of 60 degrees is a well-known value, approximately 0.866.  Substituting this into our equation, we get:

0.866 = opposite side / 23 feet

Solving for the opposite side, we find:

opposite side = 0.866 * 23 feet ≈ 19.9 feet

Since the parallelogram has two pairs of congruent sides, the perimeter is simply twice the sum of the two adjacent sides:

Perimeter = 2 * (23 feet + 19.9 feet) ≈ 85.8 feet

First, we must recognize that the shape formed by points A, T, and D is a right triangle. This is because line segment AD is a diameter of the semicircle, and any angle inscribed in a semicircle that subtends the diameter is a right angle.

Now, let's focus on the angle we need to find, ∠CTD.  Since CT is tangent to the semicircle, it forms a right angle with the radius at the point of tangency, T.  Therefore, ∠CTB = 90°.

We know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.  Therefore, in triangle CTB:

∠CTB + ∠CBT + ∠BTC = 180°

Substituting the known values:

90° + ∠CBT + ∠BTC = 180°

Simplifying:

∠CBT + ∠BTC = 90°

Now, let's look at the larger triangle, ATD.  We know that ∠ATD is a right angle (90°).  Therefore:

∠ATB + ∠BTC = 90°

Comparing this equation with the previous one, we see that:

∠CBT = ∠ATB

This means that the angle ∠CTD, which is the same as ∠BTC, is equal to 90° - ∠CBT.

Since we don't have any information about the specific lengths of the sides of the square or the position of point T, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of ∠CBT.  Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact value of ∠CTD.

However, we have established that ∠CTD = 90° - ∠CBT.  This is the most precise answer we can provide without further information.

Let us begin by understanding the relevant theorem:

**The Intersecting Secant Theorem:**  When two secants intersect outside a circle, the product of the external segment of one secant and its whole length is equal to the product of the external segment of the other secant and its whole length.

In simpler terms, if we have two secants intersecting outside a circle, and we label the external segments as 'a' and 'c' and the whole lengths as 'b' and 'd', then:

a * b = c * d

Now, let's apply this theorem to our problem.  We have:

*  External segment of one secant: 8
*  Whole length of that secant: 8 + x
*  External segment of the other secant: 12
*  Whole length of that secant: 12 + 15 = 27

Therefore, according to the theorem:

8 * (8 + x) = 12 * 27

Now, let's solve for x:

1. Expand the equation: 64 + 8x = 324
2. Subtract 64 from both sides: 8x = 260

First, we must recognize that ∠ABD is an inscribed angle of the circle.  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share a common endpoint on the circle's circumference.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

In this case, ∠ABD intercepts arc AD.  Therefore, the measure of arc AD is twice the measure of ∠ABD, or 2 * 50° = 100°.

Now, let's focus on ∠BCD.  This angle is also an inscribed angle, intercepting arc BD.  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, arc BD is a semicircle, and its measure is 180°.

Finally, we can apply the inscribed angle theorem again.  The measure of ∠BCD is half the measure of its intercepted arc, which is arc BD.  Therefore, ∠BCD = 1/2 * 180° = 90°.

First, we must understand the relationship between the central angle and the intercepted arc.  A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle, and its sides intersect the circle at two points.  The intercepted arc is the portion of the circle that lies between these two points.

The key principle here is that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  In our case, $\angle PSQ$ is a central angle, and its intercepted arc is $\widehat{PQ}$.  Therefore, $m\angle PSQ = m\widehat{PQ}$.

Now, we are given that $m\widehat{PQR} = 98$.  This means that the measure of the entire arc from $P$ to $Q$ to $R$ is 98 degrees.  Since $\widehat{PQ}$ is a part of this arc, we can find its measure by subtracting the measure of $\widehat{QR}$ from the measure of $\widehat{PQR}$.

However, we are not given the measure of $\widehat{QR}$.  But, we can find it using the fact that the measure of a circle is 360 degrees.  Therefore, $m\widehat{QR} = 360 - m\widehat{PQR} = 360 - 98 = 262$.

Finally, we can find the measure of $\widehat{PQ}$:

$m\widehat{PQ} = m\widehat{PQR} - m\widehat{QR} = 98 - 262 = \boxed{-164}$.

However, Watson, we have a problem.  The measure of an arc cannot be negative.  This indicates that there is an error in the given information.  It is impossible for the measure of $\widehat{PQR}$ to be 98 degrees if $\widehat{QR}$ is a major arc.

First, we must understand the given information. We are presented with a triangle ABC, where CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB, and BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC.  The point F is the intersection of these two angle bisectors.  Furthermore, we know that CG is perpendicular to AB, and angle ACG is 32 degrees.

Now, let's apply our deductive reasoning.  Since CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB, we know that angle ACD is equal to angle BCD.  Similarly, since BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, we know that angle ABE is equal to angle CBE.

Focusing on triangle ACG, we see that angle CAG is 90 degrees minus angle ACG, which is 90 - 32 = 58 degrees.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can calculate angle AGC as 180 - 58 - 90 = 32 degrees.

Now, let's consider triangle BFC.  We know that angle BFC is equal to 180 degrees minus the sum of angles FBC and FCB.  To find these angles, we need to utilize the angle bisector property.

Since CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB, we know that angle FCB is half of angle ACB.  Similarly, since BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, we know that angle FBC is half of angle ABC.

Therefore, angle BFC = 180 - (1/2 * angle ABC + 1/2 * angle ACB).  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can substitute angle ABC + angle ACB with 180 - angle BAC.

This gives us angle BFC = 180 - (1/2 * (180 - angle BAC)) = 90 + (1/2 * angle BAC).

To find angle BAC, we can use the fact that the angles in triangle ABC add up to 180 degrees.  We know that angle ACB is twice angle FCB, and angle ABC is twice angle FBC.  Therefore, angle BAC = 180 - 2 * angle FCB - 2 * angle FBC.

Substituting this into our equation for angle BFC, we get:

angle BFC = 90 + (1/2 * (180 - 2 * angle FCB - 2 * angle FBC)) = 180 - angle FCB - angle FBC.

Finally, we can substitute the values we know for angle FCB and angle FBC, which are half of angle ACB and angle ABC respectively.  This gives us:

angle BFC = 180 - (1/2 * angle ACB) - (1/2 * angle ABC).

Since we know that angle ACB + angle ABC = 180 - angle BAC, we can substitute this into our equation for angle BFC:

angle BFC = 180 - (1/2 * (180 - angle BAC)) = 90 + (1/2 * angle BAC).

We have already calculated angle BAC to be 180 - 2 * angle FCB - 2 * angle FBC.  Substituting this into our equation for angle BFC, we get:

angle BFC = 90 + (1/2 * (180 - 2 * angle FCB - 2 * angle FBC)) = 180 - angle FCB - angle FBC.

Finally, we can substitute the values we know for angle FCB and angle FBC, which are half of angle ACB and angle ABC respectively.  This gives us:

angle BFC = 180 - (1/2 * angle ACB) - (1/2 * angle ABC).

Now, let us recall some basic geometric principles.  The sum of the interior angles of any polygon can be calculated using the formula:

**(n - 2) * 180°**

Where 'n' represents the number of sides of the polygon.

In our case, we have a pentagon (n = 5).  Therefore, the sum of its interior angles is:

**(5 - 2) * 180° = 540°**

Since all sides and angles of a regular pentagon are equal, each interior angle measures:

**540° / 5 = 108°**

Now, let's focus on triangle ADE.  We know that angle AED is an interior angle of the pentagon, measuring 108°.  Furthermore, since OA and OE are radii of the circle, they are equal in length.  This makes triangle AOE an isosceles triangle, meaning angles OAE and OEA are also equal.

The sum of angles in any triangle is always 180°.  Therefore, we can calculate the measure of angles OAE and OEA:
