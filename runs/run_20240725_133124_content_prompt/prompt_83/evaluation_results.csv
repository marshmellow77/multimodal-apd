643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**1. The Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle C (∠C) in the circle. We know that CD is the diameter of the circle, which means it passes through the center of the circle (point O). We also know that chord DE is parallel to line segment OA, and that angle D (∠D) measures 50 degrees.

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify Key Relationships**

   * **Central Angle:**  Angle COD is a central angle because its vertex is at the center of the circle (point O).  A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc.
   * **Inscribed Angle:** Angle D is an inscribed angle because its vertex is on the circle (point D). An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Parallel Lines:** Since DE is parallel to OA, we know that angle D and angle A are corresponding angles and therefore have the same measure.

* **Step 2: Find the Measure of Arc CD**

   * Since angle COD is a central angle, its measure is equal to the measure of arc CD.
   * We know that the diameter of a circle divides it into two equal semicircles, each measuring 180 degrees.
   * Therefore, arc CD measures 180 degrees.

* **Step 3: Find the Measure of Angle A**

   * Angle D is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CD.
   * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * So, angle D (50 degrees) is half the measure of arc CD.
   * This means arc CD measures 50 degrees * 2 = 100 degrees.
   * Since angle A is corresponding to angle D, it also measures 50 degrees.

* **Step 4: Find the Measure of Angle C**

   * Angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AD.
   * The measure of arc AD is the difference between the measure of the whole circle (360 degrees) and the measure of arc CD (100 degrees).
   * Therefore, arc AD measures 360 degrees - 100 degrees = 260 degrees.
   * The measure of angle C is half the measure of arc AD.
   * So, angle C measures 260 degrees / 2 = 130 degrees.

**3. The Answer:**

The degree of angle C is **130 degrees**.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## The Problem:

The image shows a right triangle. We are asked to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is labeled ""h"". We know the length of one leg is 4 and the angle opposite that leg is 60 degrees. 

## The Solution:

To find the length of the hypotenuse, we can use the **sine** function. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the length of the side opposite the angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse.

**Formula:**

sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse

**Explanation:**

* **angle:** This is the angle we are working with, which is 60 degrees in our problem.
* **opposite:** This is the side opposite the angle, which has a length of 4 in our problem.
* **hypotenuse:** This is the side opposite the right angle, which is what we are trying to find (labeled ""h"").

**Plugging in the numbers:**

sin(60°) = 4 / h

**Solving for h:**

1. **Multiply both sides by h:** h * sin(60°) = 4
2. **Divide both sides by sin(60°):** h = 4 / sin(60°)
3. **Calculate sin(60°):** sin(60°) = √3 / 2
4. **Substitute and simplify:** h = 4 / (√3 / 2) = 8 / √3

**Rationalizing the denominator:**

To get rid of the radical in the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by √3:

h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3) = 8√3 / 3

## The Answer:

The length of the hypotenuse, h, is **8√3 / 3**.

**1. The Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle AOC (∠AOC). We know that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle with center O, and that angle ABC (∠ABC) is 70 degrees.

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand Inscribed Angles**

   An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share the same endpoint. In our problem, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle.

* **Step 2: The Inscribed Angle Theorem**

   The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  

   * **Intercepted Arc:** The intercepted arc is the part of the circle that lies inside the inscribed angle. In our problem, the intercepted arc is arc AC.

   * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle = (1/2) * Intercepted Arc

* **Step 3: Finding the Intercepted Arc**

   Since ∠ABC is 70 degrees, according to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, arc AC is twice that measure:

   * Arc AC = 2 * ∠ABC = 2 * 70 degrees = 140 degrees

* **Step 4: Understanding Central Angles**

   A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. In our problem, ∠AOC is a central angle.

* **Step 5: The Central Angle Theorem**

   The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

   * **Formula:** Central Angle = Intercepted Arc

* **Step 6: Finding ∠AOC**

   Since ∠AOC intercepts arc AC, which we know is 140 degrees, the measure of ∠AOC is:

   * ∠AOC = Arc AC = 140 degrees

610,"In the figure above, P, Q, and R lie on the same line. P is the center of the larger circle, and Q is the center of the smaller circle. If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"1. **The Problem:** The problem is asking us to find the radius of the smaller circle. We know that the radius of the larger circle is 4, and that the center of the smaller circle (Q) lies on the line that connects the center of the larger circle (P) and a point on the larger circle (R).

2. **The Solution:**

* **Step 1:**  We need to understand the relationship between the radius of the larger circle and the radius of the smaller circle. Since Q lies on the line PR, we can see that the radius of the larger circle (PQ) is equal to the sum of the radius of the smaller circle (QR) and the distance between the centers of the two circles (PQ).

* **Step 2:** We can write this relationship as an equation:  PQ = QR + PQ.

* **Step 3:** We know that PQ = 4 (the radius of the larger circle).  We want to find QR (the radius of the smaller circle).  Let's call QR ""x"".  So our equation becomes: 4 = x + PQ.

* **Step 4:** We need to find PQ.  Notice that PQ is also a radius of the larger circle.  Therefore, PQ = 4.

* **Step 5:** Now we can plug in PQ = 4 into our equation: 4 = x + 4.

* **Step 6:** To solve for x, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: 4 - 4 = x + 4 - 4.

* **Step 7:** This simplifies to 0 = x.  Therefore, the radius of the smaller circle (x) is 0.

**1. The Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3. This means we need to figure out the total force acting on particle 3 in the horizontal direction (along the x-axis).

**2. The Solution:**

**Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**

* Particle 1 exerts a force on particle 3. Let's call this force F13.
* Particle 2 exerts a force on particle 3. Let's call this force F23.
* Particle 4 exerts a force on particle 3. Let's call this force F43.

**Step 2: Determine the direction of each force.**

* **F13:** Since particle 1 has a negative charge and particle 3 has a positive charge, the force between them is attractive. This means F13 points towards particle 1, which is in the negative x-direction.
* **F23:** Since particle 2 has a positive charge and particle 3 has a positive charge, the force between them is repulsive. This means F23 points away from particle 2, which is in the positive x-direction.
* **F43:** Since particle 4 has a negative charge and particle 3 has a positive charge, the force between them is attractive. This means F43 points towards particle 4, which is in the negative x-direction.

**Step 3: Calculate the magnitude of each force.**

We can use Coulomb's Law to calculate the magnitude of each force:

* **Coulomb's Law:**  F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
    * F is the force between two charges.
    * k is Coulomb's constant (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2).
    * q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the two charges.
    * r is the distance between the two charges.

Let's calculate each force:

* **F13:**
    * F13 = k * |q1 * q3| / r13^2
    * F13 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * |(100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C)| / (a√2)^2 
    * F13 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (20 × 10^-15 C^2) / (0.05 m * √2)^2

The image shows a right triangle with the lengths of two sides given. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle J, which is one of the acute angles in the triangle.

## The Solution:

To find the measure of angle J, we can use the **sine** function. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.

**Formula:**

sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse

**Explanation:**

* **angle:** The angle we are trying to find (in this case, angle J).
* **opposite side:** The side of the triangle that is opposite the angle (in this case, the side with length 9).
* **hypotenuse:** The longest side of the right triangle (in this case, the side with length 14).

**Plugging in the numbers:**

sin(J) = 9 / 14

**Solving for J:**

To find the measure of angle J, we need to use the inverse sine function (also called arcsine), which is denoted as sin⁻¹ or asin.

J = sin⁻¹(9/14)

**1. The Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.  The perimeter is the total length of all the sides added together.  We know that PA = 8.0, and we need to figure out the lengths of PC, CD, and PD.

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand Tangents**

   * A tangent line is a line that touches a circle at exactly one point.  In this problem, we have three tangent lines: PA, PB, and CD.
   * An important property of tangents is that the two tangent segments drawn from a point outside the circle to the circle are equal in length.  This means:
      * PA = PB = 8.0
      * PC = CD
      * PD = DB

* **Step 2: Find the Length of CD**

   * Since PC = CD, we can find the length of CD by finding the length of PC.
   * We know that PA = 8.0 and PC is a part of PA.  To find PC, we need to subtract the length of CA from PA.
   * However, we don't know the length of CA yet.  Let's look at the triangle OCA.
   * Triangle OCA is a right triangle because OA is a radius of the circle and CA is a tangent line, and the radius is always perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact.
   * We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of CA:
      * **Pythagorean Theorem:** a² + b² = c²
      * Where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.
      * In triangle OCA, OA is the radius of the circle (let's assume it's 'r'), CA is one leg, and OC is the other leg.
      * So, we have: r² + CA² = OC²
      * We don't know the length of OC, but we can use the fact that OC is also a radius of the circle, so OC = r.
      * Now we have: r² + CA² = r²
      * Subtracting r² from both sides, we get: CA² = 0
      * This means CA = 0.
   * Since CA = 0, PC = PA = 8.0.
   * Therefore, CD = PC = 8.0.

* **Step 3: Find the Length of PD**

   * We know that PD = DB.
   * We also know that PB = 8.0.
   * To find PD, we need to subtract the length of DB from PB.
   * Since PD = DB, we can subtract PD from PB: PB - PD = PD
   * This means 8.0 - PD = PD
   * Adding PD to both sides, we get: 8.0 = 2PD
   * Dividing both sides by 2, we get: PD = 4.0

* **Step 4: Calculate the Perimeter**

   * The perimeter of triangle PCD is the sum of all its sides: PC + CD + PD
   * Perimeter = 8.0 + 8.0 + 4.0 = 20.0

The perimeter of triangle PCD is **20.0**.

   ∠A + ∠A + ∠BAD = 180°
   2∠A + ∠BAD = 180°

   2∠A + (90° - ∠A) = 180°
   2∠A + 90° - ∠A = 180°
   ∠A + 90° = 180°

776,Find $JQ$ if $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$.  Rounded to the nearest hundredth.,18.79,"The problem is asking us to find the length of line segment $JQ$.  We are given that $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$.  The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  The incenter is also the center of the triangle's incircle, which is the circle that is tangent to all three sides of the triangle.

To find $JQ$, we can use the formula for the inradius of a triangle:

$$r = \frac{K}{s}$$

where $r$ is the inradius, $K$ is the area of the triangle, and $s$ is the semiperimeter of the triangle.

The semiperimeter of a triangle is half the perimeter of the triangle.  So, we need to find the perimeter of $\triangle JLN$.  We are given that $JL = 16.5$.  We need to find $LN$ and $JN$.

To find $LN$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem.  We know that $LM = 9$ and $MN = 9$.  So, we have:

$$LN = \sqrt{LM^2 + MN^2} = \sqrt{9^2 + 9^2} = \sqrt{162} = 9\sqrt{2}$$

To find $JN$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem again.  We know that $JQ = r$ and $QN = r$.  So, we have:

$$JN = \sqrt{JQ^2 + QN^2} = \sqrt{r^2 + r^2} = \sqrt{2r^2} = r\sqrt{2}$$

Now, we can find the perimeter of $\triangle JLN$:

$$JL + LN + JN = 16.5 + 9\sqrt{2} + r\sqrt{2}$$

The semiperimeter of $\triangle JLN$ is:

$$s = \frac{1}{2}(16.5 + 9\sqrt{2} + r\sqrt{2}) = 8.25 + 4.5\sqrt{2} + \frac{r\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

Now, we need to find the area of $\triangle JLN$.  We can use the formula for the area of a triangle:

$$K = \frac{1}{2}bh$$

where $b$ is the base of the triangle and $h$ is the height of the triangle.

We can use $JL$ as the base of $\triangle JLN$ and $QN$ as the height of $\triangle JLN$.  We know that $QN = r$.  So, we have:

$$K = \frac{1}{2}(JL)(QN) = \frac{1}{2}(16.5)(r) = 8.25r$$

Now, we can plug in the values we have found for $K$ and $s$ into the formula for the inradius:

$$r = \frac{K}{s} = \frac{8.25r}{8.25 + 4.5\sqrt{2} + \frac{r\sqrt{2}}{2}}$$

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by the denominator:

$$r(8.25 + 4.5\sqrt{2} + \frac{r\sqrt{2}}{2}) = 8.25r$$

Expanding the left side of the equation, we get:

$$8.25r + 4.5r\sqrt{2} + \frac{r^2\sqrt{2}}{2} = 8.25r$$

Subtracting $8.25r$ from both sides of the equation, we get:

$$4.5r\sqrt{2} + \frac{r^2\sqrt{2}}{2} = 0$$

Factoring out $r\sqrt{2}$, we get:

$$r\sqrt{2}(4.5 + \frac{r}{2}) = 0$$

This equation has two solutions: $r = 0$ and $r = -9$.  Since the inradius of a triangle cannot be negative, we know that $r = 0$.

However, this answer doesn't make sense.  If $r = 0$, then the incircle of $\triangle JLN$ would have a radius of 0, which means it would be a point.  This is not possible.  Therefore, we must have made a mistake somewhere in our calculations.

The image shows a triangle ABC with a line segment DE that is the perpendicular bisector of AB. This means that DE cuts AB in half and forms a right angle with AB. We are given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13. The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

## The Solution:

**Step 1: Understand the Perpendicular Bisector**

The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line that cuts the segment in half and forms a right angle with it. In this case, DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, so AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

**Step 2: Find the Length of AE**

Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AE = BE.  We also know that the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, which means AC + CE + AE = 13.  Since AE = BE, we can rewrite this as AC + CE + BE = 13.  We can also see that AC + CE + BE is the same as the perimeter of triangle ABC.  Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC is 13.

**Step 3: Find the Perimeter of Triangle ABC**

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.  We know that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ABC is 13.  Therefore, BC = 13 - AB = 13 - 6 = 7.

**Step 4: Calculate the Perimeter of Triangle ABC**

The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC.  We know that AB = 6 and BC = 7.  We also know that AC + CE + BE = 13, and since AE = BE, we can rewrite this as AC + CE + AE = 13.  Therefore, AC = 13 - CE - AE.  We don't know the lengths of CE and AE, but we know that AC + CE + AE = 13.  Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC is 6 + 7 + 13 = 26.

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Draw a diagram:**  The problem gives us a parallelogram ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point F.  We also know that BE bisects angle ABC and CF bisects angle BCD.  We need to find the length of EF.

2. **Identify key relationships:**  Since BE bisects angle ABC, we know that angle ABE is equal to angle CBE.  Similarly, since CF bisects angle BCD, we know that angle BCF is equal to angle DCF.

3. **Use angle properties:**  We know that the opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal.  Therefore, angle BAD is equal to angle BCD.  Since CF bisects angle BCD, we know that angle BCF is half of angle BCD.  Similarly, angle ABE is half of angle BAD.  Therefore, angle ABE is equal to angle BCF.

4. **Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem:**  The Angle Bisector Theorem states that if a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.  In triangle ABD, BE bisects angle ABD.  Therefore, we can apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to get: AE/ED = AB/BD.

5. **Find BD:**  We know that AB = 3 and AD = 4.  Since ABCD is a parallelogram, we know that opposite sides are equal.  Therefore, BC = AD = 4.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BD: BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 25.  Therefore, BD = 5.

6. **Solve for AE and ED:**  We know that AE/ED = AB/BD = 3/5.  Let AE = 3x and ED = 5x.  Since AE + ED = AD = 4, we have 3x + 5x = 4.  Solving for x, we get x = 1/2.  Therefore, AE = 3/2 and ED = 5/2.

7. **Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem again:**  In triangle BCD, CF bisects angle BCD.  Therefore, we can apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to get: BF/FD = BC/BD = 4/5.  Let BF = 4y and FD = 5y.  Since BF + FD = BD = 5, we have 4y + 5y = 5.  Solving for y, we get y = 1/3.  Therefore, BF = 4/3 and FD = 5/3.

8. **Find EF:**  Finally, we can find EF by subtracting the lengths of AE and BF from the length of AD: EF = AD - AE - BF = 4 - 3/2 - 4/3 = 5/6.

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle EOB. We are given that line AB and line CD intersect at point O, line OD bisects angle AOE, and angle BOC is 50 degrees. 

## The Solution:

**Step 1: Understand what it means for a line to bisect an angle.**

* **Definition:** When a line bisects an angle, it divides the angle into two equal angles.
* **In our problem:** Line OD bisects angle AOE, meaning angle AOD is equal to angle DOE.

**Step 2: Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.**

* **Formula:** Angle AOB + Angle BOC + Angle COD = 180 degrees
* **Explanation:**  Angles AOB, BOC, and COD form a straight line, so their sum is 180 degrees.
* **Plugging in the numbers:** We know angle BOC is 50 degrees. We don't know angle AOB or angle COD yet.
* **Equation:** Angle AOB + 50 degrees + Angle COD = 180 degrees

**Step 3: Use the fact that angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.**

* **Formula:** Angle AOD + Angle DOE + Angle EOB + Angle BOC = 360 degrees
* **Explanation:** Angles AOD, DOE, EOB, and BOC form a complete circle around point O, so their sum is 360 degrees.
* **Plugging in the numbers:** We know angle BOC is 50 degrees. We also know that angle AOD is equal to angle DOE. Let's call each of these angles 'x'.
* **Equation:** x + x + Angle EOB + 50 degrees = 360 degrees

**Step 4: Solve for Angle EOB.**

* **Simplify the equation:** 2x + Angle EOB + 50 degrees = 360 degrees
* **Combine like terms:** 2x + Angle EOB = 310 degrees
* **Solve for Angle EOB:** Angle EOB = 310 degrees - 2x

**Step 5: Solve for x (angle AOD and angle DOE).**

* **Use the equation from Step 2:** Angle AOB + 50 degrees + Angle COD = 180 degrees
* **Since angle AOD = angle DOE = x:** 2x + Angle AOB + Angle COD = 180 degrees
* **We don't know angle AOB or angle COD, but we can use the equation from Step 3:** 2x + Angle EOB + 50 degrees = 360 degrees
* **Substitute the value of Angle EOB from Step 4:** 2x + (310 degrees - 2x) + 50 degrees = 360 degrees
* **Simplify:** 360 degrees = 360 degrees
* **This means x can be any value.**

**Step 6: Find Angle EOB.**

* **Since x can be any value, we can't determine a specific value for Angle EOB.**
* **However, we can express Angle EOB in terms of x:** Angle EOB = 310 degrees - 2x

## The Answer:

Angle EOB = 310 degrees - 2x, where x is the measure of angle AOD and angle DOE. We cannot determine a specific numerical value for Angle EOB without knowing the value of x.

**1. The Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle P (∠P) in the diagram. We are given that the central angles of arc AB (⁀AB) and arc CD (⁀CD) are 90 degrees and 50 degrees, respectively.

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand Central Angles and Inscribed Angles**

   * A **central angle** is an angle whose vertex is at the center of a circle (point O in our diagram). The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * An **inscribed angle** is an angle whose vertex lies on the circle and whose sides are chords of the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Step 2: Find the Measure of Inscribed Angle ACB**

   * We know that central angle AOB is 90 degrees (given).
   * Since inscribed angle ACB intercepts the same arc as central angle AOB, its measure is half of 90 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠ACB = 90 degrees / 2 = 45 degrees.

* **Step 3: Find the Measure of Inscribed Angle ADB**

   * We know that central angle COD is 50 degrees (given).
   * Since inscribed angle ADB intercepts the same arc as central angle COD, its measure is half of 50 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠ADB = 50 degrees / 2 = 25 degrees.

* **Step 4: Apply the Angle Sum Property of Triangles**

   * The **angle sum property of triangles** states that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
   * In triangle PAB, we know ∠ACB = 45 degrees and ∠ADB = 25 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠P + ∠ACB + ∠ADB = 180 degrees.
   * Substituting the known values, we get: ∠P + 45 degrees + 25 degrees = 180 degrees.

* **Step 5: Solve for ∠P**

   * Combining like terms, we get: ∠P + 70 degrees = 180 degrees.
   * Subtracting 70 degrees from both sides, we get: ∠P = 180 degrees - 70 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠P = 110 degrees.

2. **The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Find the radius of the circle.**
    * We know the area of a circle is calculated using the formula: Area = πr², where r is the radius of the circle.
    * We are given the area of the circle is 18π square units.
    * Let's plug that into the formula: 18π = πr²
    * Now, we need to solve for r. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by π: 18π/π = πr²/π
    * This simplifies to 18 = r²
    * To find r, we take the square root of both sides: √18 = √r²
    * This gives us r = √18, which can be simplified to r = 3√2.

* **Step 2: Find the diagonal of the square.**
    * The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
    * The diameter of a circle is twice the radius.
    * So, the diagonal of the square is 2 * 3√2 = 6√2.

* **Step 3: Find the side length of the square.**
    * We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length of the square. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
    * In this case, the diagonal of the square is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, and the sides of the square are the other two sides.
    * Let's call the side length of the square 's'.
    * So, we have: (6√2)² = s² + s²
    * Simplifying: 72 = 2s²
    * Dividing both sides by 2: 36 = s²
    * Taking the square root of both sides: √36 = √s²
    * This gives us s = 6.

1. **Draw a diagram:**  It's always helpful to draw a diagram to visualize the problem.  The diagram is already provided, so we can use that.

2. **Identify key relationships:** We know that N is the midpoint of BC, so BN = NC. We also know that AM bisects angle BAC, so angle BAM = angle CAM.  Finally, we know that BM is perpendicular to AM, so angle BMA = 90 degrees.

3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BM. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In triangle BMA, BM is the hypotenuse, and BA and MA are the other two sides. So, we have:

   BM² = BA² + MA²

   We know that BA = 8, and we can find MA by using the fact that MN = 2 and BM is perpendicular to AM.  Since BM is perpendicular to AM, triangle BMN is a right triangle.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem again to find MA:

   MA² = BM² - MN²

   We can substitute the value of MN into this equation:

   MA² = BM² - 2²

   MA² = BM² - 4

   Now we can substitute this value of MA² into the first equation:

**1. The Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the diameter of the circle. We are given that line AB is tangent to the circle at point A, and we know the lengths of AB and OB.

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between a tangent line and a radius.**

   A tangent line is a line that touches a circle at exactly one point. The radius of a circle is a line segment that connects the center of the circle to a point on the circle.  A tangent line and a radius drawn to the point of tangency are always perpendicular to each other.

* **Step 2: Visualize the problem.**

   Draw a line from point O (the center of the circle) to point A. This line is a radius of the circle. Since AB is tangent to the circle, we know that angle OAB is a right angle.

* **Step 3: Use the Pythagorean Theorem.**

   We now have a right triangle OAB. We know the lengths of two sides: AB = 8 and OB = 10. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the third side, OA (which is the radius of the circle).

   The Pythagorean Theorem states:  a² + b² = c²

   Where:
   * a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle
   * c is the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side)

   In our problem:

The problem is asking us to find the distance from the center of a circle to a chord within that circle. We know the radius of the circle is 5.0 and the length of the chord is 8.0.

## The Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**

   * A **chord** is a line segment that connects two points on a circle.
   * The **distance from the center of the circle to a chord** is the length of the perpendicular line segment drawn from the center of the circle to the chord. This line segment will bisect the chord, meaning it will cut the chord in half.

2. **Visualizing the Problem:**

   * Imagine drawing a line segment from point O (the center of the circle) to the midpoint of chord AB. This line segment will be perpendicular to chord AB.

3. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**

   * We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance from the center of the circle to the chord. The Pythagorean Theorem states:  **a² + b² = c²**
     * Where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side).

4. **Applying the Theorem:**

   * In our problem, the line segment from O to the midpoint of AB is one leg of a right triangle (let's call it 'a').
   * Half of the chord AB is the other leg of the right triangle (let's call it 'b').
   * The radius of the circle (5.0) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle (let's call it 'c').

5. **Plugging in the Values:**

   * We know that the length of the chord AB is 8.0, so half of the chord is 8.0 / 2 = 4.0. This is our 'b' value.
   * We know the radius of the circle is 5.0, which is our 'c' value.
   * We need to find 'a', the distance from the center of the circle to the chord.

   * Plugging these values into the Pythagorean Theorem:
     * a² + 4.0² = 5.0²

6. **Solving for 'a':**

   * a² + 16.0 = 25.0

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle ACB. We know that PA and PB are tangents to the circle, point A and B are the tangent points, AC is the diameter of the circle, and angle P is 50 degrees. 

## The Solution:

**Step 1: Understand Tangent Lines and Radii**

* **Tangent Lines:** A tangent line is a line that touches a circle at exactly one point. This point is called the point of tangency.
* **Radii:** A radius is a line segment that connects the center of a circle to a point on the circle.

**Step 2: Identify Key Angles**

* **Angle OAB:** Since OA is a radius and AB is a tangent, angle OAB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because a radius drawn to a point of tangency is always perpendicular to the tangent line.
* **Angle OBA:**  Similarly, angle OBA is also a right angle (90 degrees).

**Step 3: Apply the Tangent-Tangent Theorem**

* **Tangent-Tangent Theorem:**  The theorem states that if two tangents are drawn to a circle from the same external point, then the segments between the external point and the points of tangency are congruent. 
* **Applying the Theorem:** In our problem, PA and PB are tangents from point P. Therefore, PA = PB.

**Step 4: Use the Properties of Isosceles Triangles**

* **Isosceles Triangle:** A triangle with two equal sides is called an isosceles triangle. The angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.
* **Applying the Properties:** Since PA = PB, triangle PAB is an isosceles triangle. Therefore, angle PAB = angle PBA.

**Step 5: Calculate the Angles of Triangle PAB**

* **Sum of Angles in a Triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
* **Applying the Formula:** In triangle PAB, we know angle P = 50 degrees. We also know that angle PAB = angle PBA. Let's call each of these angles x. 
* **Equation:** 50 + x + x = 180
* **Solving for x:** 2x = 130
* **Answer:** x = 65 degrees. Therefore, angle PAB = angle PBA = 65 degrees.

**Step 6: Calculate Angle CAB**

* **Angle CAB:** Angle CAB is the sum of angle OAB and angle PAB.
* **Calculation:** Angle CAB = 90 degrees + 65 degrees = 155 degrees.

**Step 7: Calculate Angle ACB**

* **Angle ACB:** Angle ACB is the sum of angle CAB and angle CBA.
* **Calculation:** Angle ACB = 155 degrees + 90 degrees = 245 degrees.

**Step 8: Consider the Full Circle**

* **Full Circle:** A full circle has 360 degrees.
* **Adjusting for the Full Circle:** Since angle ACB is greater than 180 degrees, we need to subtract 360 degrees to find the actual angle within the circle.
* **Final Calculation:** Angle ACB = 245 degrees - 360 degrees = -115 degrees.

The image shows a rhombus with one diagonal labeled ""2x"" and the other labeled ""x"". The problem asks us to find the lengths of both diagonals, given that the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters.

## The Solution:

**Step 1: Understand the Formula for the Area of a Rhombus**

The area of a rhombus is calculated using the following formula:

* **Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2**

Where:

* **Area** is the area of the rhombus
* **d1** is the length of one diagonal
* **d2** is the length of the other diagonal

**Step 2: Plug in the Given Information**

We know the following:

* **Area = 169 square millimeters**
* **d1 = 2x** (the longer diagonal)
* **d2 = x** (the shorter diagonal)

**1. The Problem:**

The image shows a right triangle with three sides.  Squares are drawn on each side of the triangle.  We are given the areas of two of the squares, and we need to find the area of the third square, labeled ""A"".

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Pythagorean Theorem**

   The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We can write this as a formula:

   *  a² + b² = c²

   Where:
   *  a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides of the triangle
   *  c is the length of the hypotenuse

* **Step 2:  Find the lengths of the sides of the triangle**

   We know the areas of two of the squares.  The area of a square is found by squaring the length of one of its sides.  So, to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle, we need to take the square root of the areas of the squares.

   *  Side opposite the square with area 8: √8 = 2√2
   *  Side opposite the square with area 14: √14

**1. The Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the length of the chord AB. We know that points A, B, and C are all on a circle with a radius of 2, and that angle C is 30 degrees.

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Draw a radius from the center of the circle (O) to point C.** This creates an isosceles triangle OAC, where OA and OC are both radii of the circle.

* **Step 2:  Recognize that triangle OAC is a 30-60-90 triangle.**  Since angle C is 30 degrees, and OA and OC are equal (radii), we know that angle OAC is also 30 degrees. This means angle AOC is 120 degrees (180 - 30 - 30).

* **Step 3:  Use the properties of 30-60-90 triangles to find the length of AC.** In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is √3 times the length of the shorter leg.

    * **Formula:**  
        * Hypotenuse = 2 * Short Leg
        * Long Leg = √3 * Short Leg

    * **Applying the formula:**
        * We know the hypotenuse (OC) is 2 (the radius).
        * Therefore, the short leg (AC) is 2 / 2 = 1.

* **Step 4:  Find the length of AB.**  Since triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle, and angle C is 30 degrees, we know that angle AOB is 60 degrees (twice the measure of angle C). This makes triangle AOB an equilateral triangle.

1. **Understanding the Rotation:**
   * When a shape is rotated, its angles stay the same. So, angle ABC in the original triangle is the same as angle AB'C' in the rotated triangle.
   * Since triangle ABC is a right triangle, angle ABC is 90 degrees.  Therefore, angle AB'C' is also 90 degrees.

## The Solution:

Let's break this down step by step:

**Step 1: Understand Angle Bisectors**

* **Definition:** An angle bisector is a line that divides an angle into two equal angles.
* **In our problem:** BE bisects angle FBD, meaning angle FBE is equal to angle EBD. Similarly, CE bisects angle ACD, meaning angle ACE is equal to angle ECD.

**Step 2: Find Angle FBE and Angle EBD**

* **Since BE bisects angle FBD, we can write:**
    *  ∠FBE = ∠EBD = (1/2)∠FBD 
* **We don't know the measure of angle FBD, so we can't find the exact values of angle FBE and angle EBD yet.**

**Step 3: Find Angle ACE and Angle ECD**

* **Since CE bisects angle ACD, we can write:**
    * ∠ACE = ∠ECD = (1/2)∠ACD
* **We don't know the measure of angle ACD, so we can't find the exact values of angle ACE and angle ECD yet.**

**Step 4: Use the Angle Sum Property of Triangles**

* **Angle Sum Property:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.
* **Apply it to triangle BEC:**
    * ∠BEC + ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 180°
* **We know ∠BEC = 35°. We need to find ∠BCE and ∠CBE.**

**Step 5: Find Angle BCE**

* **∠BCE = ∠ACE + ∠ECD** (from the diagram)
* **Since CE bisects angle ACD, we know ∠ACE = ∠ECD.**
* **Therefore, ∠BCE = 2∠ACE**

**Step 6: Find Angle CBE**

* **∠CBE = ∠FBE + ∠EBD** (from the diagram)
* **Since BE bisects angle FBD, we know ∠FBE = ∠EBD.**
* **Therefore, ∠CBE = 2∠FBE**

**Step 7: Substitute the values into the Angle Sum Property equation**

* **We have:**
    * ∠BEC = 35°
    * ∠BCE = 2∠ACE
    * ∠CBE = 2∠FBE
* **Substitute these into the equation:**
    * 35° + 2∠ACE + 2∠FBE = 180°

**Step 8: Simplify the equation**

* **Combine like terms:**
    * 2∠ACE + 2∠FBE = 145°
* **Divide both sides by 2:**
    * ∠ACE + ∠FBE = 72.5°

**Step 9: Find Angle FAE**

* **∠FAE = ∠FBE + ∠ACE** (from the diagram)
* **We know ∠ACE + ∠FBE = 72.5°**
* **Therefore, ∠FAE = 72.5°**

* **Setting up the Equation:** We can use the concept of corresponding angles to set up an equation. In this case, the angles marked (4x + 11)° and (8x + 1)° are corresponding angles. Since we want lines *a* and *b* to be parallel, these angles must be equal.

To solve this problem, we need to use the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**. This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

**Step 1: Identify the intercepted arc.**

The intercepted arc for angle C is arc AB.

**Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

The Inscribed Angle Theorem tells us that:

Since we know ∠C = 35 degrees, we can plug that in:

      * We can choose BC as the base.
      * To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from point A to line BC. Let's call the point where this perpendicular line intersects BC as E.

   * **Step 3: Find the Height**
      * Now, we have a right triangle ABE.
      * We know ∠B = 30.0° and AB = 6.0.
      * We can use trigonometry to find the height AE.
      * The sine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse.
      * sin(∠B) = AE / AB

**Step 1: Identify the equal sides**

The problem tells us that the triangle is isosceles.  This means that two of the sides are equal in length.  Looking at the triangle, we can see that sides AB and BC are both labeled with expressions that include the variable x.  This means that these two sides are equal in length.

**Step 2: Set up an equation**

Since we know that AB and BC are equal in length, we can set their expressions equal to each other.  This gives us the equation:

9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5

**Step 3: Solve for x**

To solve for x, we need to get all of the x terms on one side of the equation and all of the constant terms on the other side.  We can do this by subtracting 5x from both sides of the equation and adding 1 to both sides of the equation.  This gives us:

9x - 1 - 5x + 1 = 5x - 0.5 - 5x + 1

Simplifying both sides of the equation, we get:

      * angle BOF = angle AOB - angle AOF = 90 degrees - 40 degrees = 50 degrees.

3. **Find angle FOB:**
   * We know that OF is a radius of the circle, and since AB is a diameter, OF is also perpendicular to AB. This means angle FOC is a right angle (90 degrees).

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle EOD. We are given that CD is the diameter of the circle, G is the midpoint of chord EF, and angle DCF is 20 degrees.

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Properties of Circles and Chords**

   * **Diameter:** A diameter is a line segment that passes through the center of a circle and has endpoints on the circle.
   * **Chord:** A chord is a line segment that connects two points on a circle.
   * **Midpoint:** The midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides the segment into two equal parts.

   * **Important Property:**  A diameter that bisects a chord is perpendicular to the chord. This means that line segment CG is perpendicular to line segment EF.

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand Rectangles**

   A rectangle is a four-sided shape where all angles are right angles (90 degrees). This means that all the corners of the rectangle are 90 degrees.

* **Step 2: Identify the Relationship Between Angles**

   Angles 1 and 2 are adjacent angles within the rectangle. Adjacent angles are angles that share a common side and vertex (corner point). In a rectangle, adjacent angles are supplementary, which means they add up to 180 degrees.

* **Step 3: Use the Formula**

   The formula for supplementary angles is:

   m∠1 + m∠2 = 180°

   We know m∠1 = 38°, so we can plug that into the formula:

   38° + m∠2 = 180°

* **Step 4: Solve for m∠2**

   To find m∠2, we need to isolate it. We can do this by subtracting 38° from both sides of the equation:

**1. The Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle C (∠C) in the circle. We are given that:

* ∠D = 35°
* ∠AEC = 105°

**2. The Solution:**

**Step 1: Understand the Relationship Between Angles**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

* **Vertical Angles:** Vertical angles are opposite angles formed by the intersection of two lines. Vertical angles are always congruent (equal in measure).

**Step 2: Find ∠CED**

* We know that ∠AEC = 105°.
* ∠CED and ∠AEC are vertical angles.
* Therefore, ∠CED = ∠AEC = 105°.

**Step 3: Find ∠CDE**

* We know that ∠D = 35°.
* ∠CDE and ∠D are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°).
* Therefore, ∠CDE = 180° - ∠D = 180° - 35° = 145°.

**Step 4: Find ∠C**

* We know that the angles inside a triangle add up to 180°.
* In triangle CDE, we have: ∠C + ∠CED + ∠CDE = 180°
* Substituting the values we found: ∠C + 105° + 145° = 180°
* Simplifying: ∠C + 250° = 180°
* Solving for ∠C: ∠C = 180° - 250° = -70°

**Step 5: Adjust for Negative Angle**

* Since angles in a triangle cannot be negative, we need to adjust our answer.
* We can add 360° to the negative angle to get a positive equivalent: -70° + 360° = 290°

**3. The Answer:**

Therefore, ∠C = **290°**.

The image shows a circle with a triangle inside of it. The circle has a diameter of 24. One side of the triangle is a diameter of the circle, and the other two sides of the triangle intersect the circle. We are asked to find the length of the side of the triangle labeled ""x"".

## The Solution:

To find the length of ""x"", we can use the **Intersecting Secant Theorem**. This theorem states that if two secants intersect outside a circle, then the product of the lengths of one secant and its external segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the other secant and its external segment.

**Here's how to apply the theorem:**

1. **Identify the secants and their external segments:**
    * **Secant 1:** The line segment with length ""x"" + 24. Its external segment is ""x"".
    * **Secant 2:** The line segment with length 12.25 + 9. Its external segment is 9.

2. **Write the formula:**
    (Secant 1)(External Segment 1) = (Secant 2)(External Segment 2)

3. **Plug in the values:**
    (x + 24)(x) = (12.25 + 9)(9)

4. **Simplify the equation:**
    x² + 24x = 191.25

5. **Rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation:**
    x² + 24x - 191.25 = 0

6. **Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:**
    x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
    Where:
        * a = 1
        * b = 24
        * c = -191.25

7. **Plug in the values and solve:**
    x = (-24 ± √(24² - 4 * 1 * -191.25)) / 2 * 1
    x = (-24 ± √(1156 + 765)) / 2
    x = (-24 ± √1921) / 2
    x = (-24 ± 43.8) / 2

8. **Calculate the two possible solutions:**
    x₁ = (-24 + 43.8) / 2 = 9.9
    x₂ = (-24 - 43.8) / 2 = -33.9

9. **Choose the valid solution:**

**1. The Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle BAO.  We know that points A, B, and C are on a circle with center O, and that angle ACB is 25 degrees.

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between the angles.**

   *  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle. This means its vertex (point C) is on the circle, and its sides are chords of the circle (lines AC and BC).
   *  Angle BAO is a central angle. This means its vertex (point O) is at the center of the circle, and its sides are radii of the circle (lines OA and OB).

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify Key Relationships**

   * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:**  A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means that line OC is perpendicular to line CD (∠OCB = 90 degrees).

   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Since AB is a diameter, arc ACB is a semicircle, and ∠ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting this semicircle.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**

   * The inscribed angle theorem tells us that ∠ACB = 1/2 * 180 degrees = 90 degrees.

* **Step 3: Use the Angle Sum Property of Triangles**

   * The angles inside any triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle ABC:
      * ∠A + ∠ACB + ∠ABC = 180 degrees
      * 25 degrees + 90 degrees + ∠ABC = 180 degrees
      * ∠ABC = 180 degrees - 115 degrees = 65 degrees

* **Step 4: Use the fact that ∠OCB is a right angle**

   * Since ∠OCB = 90 degrees, and we know ∠ABC = 65 degrees, we can find ∠OBC:
      * ∠OBC = 90 degrees - 65 degrees = 25 degrees

* **Step 5: Use the fact that ∠DCO is a right angle**

   * Since line CD is tangent to the circle, ∠DCO = 90 degrees.

* **Step 6: Use the Angle Sum Property of Triangles**

   * In triangle DCO:
      * ∠D + ∠DCO + ∠CDO = 180 degrees

To solve this, we need to understand what a perimeter is and how it works with triangles.

**Step 1: What is a perimeter?**

The perimeter of any shape is the total distance around the outside of that shape.  Think of it like walking around the edge of a park - you're walking the perimeter!

**Step 2: How do we find the perimeter of a triangle?**

To find the perimeter of a triangle, we add up the lengths of all three sides.  

**Step 3: What do we know about this triangle?**

We know that two sides of the triangle are 7 and 12.  We don't know the length of the third side.

**Step 4: How can we find the possible perimeters?**

We need to think about the possible lengths of the third side.  The third side must be longer than the difference between the other two sides (12 - 7 = 5) and shorter than the sum of the other two sides (12 + 7 = 19).

**Step 5: What are the possible perimeters?**

If the third side is 5, the perimeter would be 7 + 12 + 5 = 24.

The problem is asking us to find the perimeter of the polygon ABCDE.  The perimeter is the total length of all the sides of a shape added together.

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Find the side length of the square.**

   We know the area of the square is 1.  The area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself (side * side).  So, to find the side length, we need to find the square root of the area.

   * Formula: Area of a square = side * side
   * We know the area is 1, so: 1 = side * side
   * To find the side length, we take the square root of both sides: √1 = √(side * side)
   * This gives us: 1 = side
   * So, the side length of the square is 1.

* **Step 2: Find the side length of the equilateral triangle.**

   An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal.  We know that side CE of the triangle is also a side of the square, which we just found to be 1.  Therefore, all sides of the triangle are also 1.

We are given that the perimeter of triangle AMN is the smallest possible, and we need to use this information to find the angles.

Here's how to solve it:

**Step 1: Understand the problem**

The problem is asking us to find the sum of two angles in a triangle. We are given that the perimeter of the triangle is the smallest possible, which means that the triangle is an isosceles triangle.

**Step 2: Find the angles of the isosceles triangle**

Since the perimeter of triangle AMN is the smallest possible, it means that AM = AN. This makes triangle AMN an isosceles triangle. In an isosceles triangle, the two base angles are equal. Therefore, ∠AMN = ∠ANM.

**Step 3: Use the angle sum property of a triangle**

The angle sum property of a triangle states that the sum of all three angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.  We can write this as a formula:

∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°

In our triangle AMN, we know that ∠AMN = ∠ANM.  Let's call this angle x.  We can now rewrite the angle sum property for triangle AMN:

x + x + ∠MAN = 180°

**Step 4: Solve for x**

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + ∠MAN = 180°

To solve for x, we need to find the value of ∠MAN.  We can do this by looking at the larger quadrilateral ABCD.

**Step 5: Find ∠MAN**

We know that ∠BAD = 120° and ∠B = ∠D = 90°.  Since the angles in a quadrilateral add up to 360°, we can find ∠MAN:

∠MAN = 360° - ∠BAD - ∠B - ∠D

∠MAN = 360° - 120° - 90° - 90°

∠MAN = 60°

**Step 6: Substitute and solve for x**

Now that we know ∠MAN = 60°, we can substitute it back into our equation:

2x + 60° = 180°

Subtracting 60° from both sides, we get:

2x = 120°

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 60°

**Step 7: Find the sum of the angles**

We know that ∠AMN = ∠ANM = x = 60°.  Therefore, the sum of these angles is:

∠AMN + ∠ANM = 60° + 60° = 120°

1. **Understanding Congruent Triangles:** The problem states that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF. This means that all corresponding angles and sides of the two triangles are equal. 

2. **Finding Angle B:** Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, we know that angle A is equal to angle D, and angle B is equal to angle E. We are given that angle A is 22 degrees, so angle D is also 22 degrees.

3. **Finding Angle C:** We know that angle CGF is 88 degrees. Since CD bisects angle BCA, we know that angle BCD is equal to angle ACD.  We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find angle C:

   * We also know that angle BCD is 25 degrees.

2. **Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

**1. The Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle PAQ (∠PAQ). We are given that ∠BAC = 110 degrees and that A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ.

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand Symmetry**

   * Symmetry means that if you fold the figure along a line, the two halves will perfectly match. 
   * In this case, since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, folding the figure along line MP will make point A land exactly on point B.
   * Similarly, folding the figure along line NQ will make point A land exactly on point C.

* **Step 2: Use Symmetry to Find Angles**

   * Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP.
   * Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, we know that ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.

* **Step 3: Use Angle Properties**

   * We know that the angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠AMP + ∠BMP + ∠APM = 360 degrees.
   * Since ∠AMP = ∠BMP, we can rewrite this as 2 * ∠AMP + ∠APM = 360 degrees.

* **Step 4: Find ∠APM**

   * We know that ∠BAC = 110 degrees.
   * Since ∠BAC is made up of ∠BAP + ∠PAC, we can write ∠BAP + ∠PAC = 110 degrees.
   * Because of symmetry, ∠BAP = ∠CAP.
   * Therefore, 2 * ∠CAP = 110 degrees, and ∠CAP = 55 degrees.
   * Since ∠CAP = ∠APM, we know that ∠APM = 55 degrees.

* **Step 5: Find ∠AMP**

   * We know that 2 * ∠AMP + ∠APM = 360 degrees.
   * Plugging in ∠APM = 55 degrees, we get 2 * ∠AMP + 55 degrees = 360 degrees.
   * Solving for ∠AMP, we get ∠AMP = 152.5 degrees.

* **Step 6: Find ∠PAQ**

   * ∠PAQ is made up of ∠PAM + ∠QAM.
   * Since ∠PAM = ∠CAP = 55 degrees, and ∠QAM = ∠AMP = 152.5 degrees, we can find ∠PAQ:
     * ∠PAQ = ∠PAM + ∠QAM = 55 degrees + 152.5 degrees = 207.5 degrees.

One chord is labeled with an angle measure of 83 degrees, and the other chord is labeled with an angle measure of (2*x - 27) degrees. We are also told that the two segments of the chord labeled with (2*x - 27) degrees are congruent.

2. **The Solution:**

* **Step 1:**  We need to understand the relationship between the angles formed by intersecting chords inside a circle.  The theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

* **Step 2:** Let's label the intercepted arcs.  Let's call the arc intercepted by the 83-degree angle *arc GJ*. Let's call the arc intercepted by the (2*x - 27)-degree angle *arc KH*.

* **Step 3:** We can use the theorem to set up an equation.  The measure of angle *CHJ* is equal to half the sum of the measures of *arc GJ* and *arc KH*.  We can write this as:

    *  *CHJ* = 1/2 (*GJ* + *KH*)

* **Step 4:** We know that *CHJ* = 83 degrees.  We also know that *KH* = 2 * *KJ* because we are told that *CH* is congruent to *KJ*.  We can substitute these values into our equation:

    *  83 = 1/2 (*GJ* + 2 * *KJ*)

* **Step 5:** We need to find a way to express *GJ* and *KJ* in terms of *x*.  We know that the measure of an entire circle is 360 degrees.  We can use this to find *GJ*:

    *  *GJ* = 360 - (2*x - 27) = 387 - 2*x

* **Step 6:** We can now substitute this value for *GJ* into our equation:

    *  83 = 1/2 (387 - 2*x + 2 * *KJ*)

* **Step 7:** We can simplify this equation:

    *  83 = 1/2 (387 - 2*x + 2 * *KJ*)
    *  166 = 387 - 2*x + 2 * *KJ*
    *  -221 = -2*x + 2 * *KJ*

* **Step 8:** We can now substitute the value of *KJ* into our equation.  Since *KH* = 2 * *KJ*, we know that *KJ* = 1/2 * *KH*.  We can substitute this into our equation:

    *  -221 = -2*x + 2 * (1/2 * *KH*)
    *  -221 = -2*x + *KH*

* **Step 9:** We know that *KH* = 2*x - 27.  We can substitute this into our equation:

**1. The Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the length of side RS of triangle QRS. We know that the triangle is equilateral, which means all three sides are equal in length.

**2. The Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand Equilateral Triangles**
    * An equilateral triangle is a triangle where all three sides are the same length.
    * This means that side QR, side RS, and side QS are all equal.

* **Step 2: Set Up an Equation**
    * We know that side QR has a length of 4x.
    * We know that side RS has a length of 2x + 1.
    * Since the triangle is equilateral, these two sides must be equal.
    * We can write this as an equation: 4x = 2x + 1

* **Step 3: Solve for x**
    * To solve for x, we need to get all the x terms on one side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other side.
    * Subtract 2x from both sides of the equation: 4x - 2x = 2x + 1 - 2x
    * This simplifies to: 2x = 1
    * Divide both sides of the equation by 2: 2x / 2 = 1 / 2
    * This gives us: x = 1/2

* **Step 4: Find the Length of RS**
    * We know that RS has a length of 2x + 1.
    * Now that we know x = 1/2, we can plug that value into the expression for RS: 2(1/2) + 1
    * This simplifies to: 1 + 1 = 2

The image shows a circle with two lines intersecting inside of it. One line is a diameter of the circle, and the other line intersects the circle at two points. The problem asks us to find the value of *x*.

## The Solution:

The problem gives us three angles:

*  **(4x + 50)°**  This angle is formed by the diameter and the line that intersects the circle at two points.
*  **3x°** This angle is formed by the line that intersects the circle at two points and the tangent line.
*  **30°** This angle is formed by the tangent line and the line that intersects the circle at two points.

**Step 2: Understand the relationship between the angles.**

We need to use a theorem called the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**. This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Inscribed Angle:** An angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle.
* **Intercepted Arc:** The arc of the circle that lies between the two chords that form the inscribed angle.

In our problem, the angle **(4x + 50)°** is an inscribed angle, and its intercepted arc is the entire circle, which measures 360°.

**Step 3: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we can set up an equation:

**(4x + 50)° = (1/2) * 360°**

**Step 4: Solve for x.**

1. Simplify the right side of the equation:
**(4x + 50)° = 180°**

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Simplify the circuit:**

   * Imagine cutting the circuit at a point where the pattern repeats.  Let's cut it after the first three resistors.
   * The part of the circuit to the right of the cut is identical to the entire circuit.  We can represent this with a single resistor with an equivalent resistance, which we'll call R'.

2. **Find the equivalent resistance of the simplified circuit:**

   * The three resistors on the top are in series, so their equivalent resistance is R + R + R = 3R.
   * The three resistors on the bottom are also in series, so their equivalent resistance is R + R + R = 3R.
   * The two 3R resistors are in parallel, so their equivalent resistance is:

     ```
     1/R_parallel = 1/3R + 1/3R = 2/3R
     R_parallel = 3R/2
     ```

   * The equivalent resistance of the entire simplified circuit is then:

     ```
     R_total = R_parallel + R' = 3R/2 + R'
     ```

3. **Set up an equation:**

   * Since the part of the circuit to the right of the cut is identical to the entire circuit, the equivalent resistance R' must be the same as the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit, R_total.  This gives us the equation:

     ```
     R' = R_total = 3R/2 + R'
     ```

4. **Solve for R':**

   * Subtract R' from both sides:

     ```
     0 = 3R/2
     ```

   * This equation has no solution, which means our assumption that the equivalent resistance R' is finite is incorrect.  The equivalent resistance of an infinitely long chain of resistors is actually infinite.

5. **Plug in the value of R:**

   * Since R = 1, the equivalent resistance is:

     R_total = ∞

**1. The Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the perimeter of rectangle ABCD. We know that the rectangle is made up of two identical squares, and each square has an area of 9.

**2. The Solution:**

**Step 1: Find the side length of each square.**

* We know the area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself. This can be written as a formula:  Area = side * side, or Area = side².
* We are given that the area of each square is 9. So, we can plug that into our formula: 9 = side²
* To find the side length, we need to find the square root of 9. The square root of 9 is 3, because 3 * 3 = 9.
* Therefore, the side length of each square is 3.

**Step 2: Find the length and width of the rectangle.**

* The length of the rectangle is equal to the side length of two squares put together. So, the length is 3 + 3 = 6.
* The width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square. So, the width is 3.

**Step 3: Find the perimeter of the rectangle.**

* The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up the lengths of all its sides. We can write this as a formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
* We know the length is 6 and the width is 3. So, we can plug those numbers into our formula: Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 3)

   * **Explanation:** This formula tells us how many degrees all the angles inside a polygon add up to. We subtract 2 from the number of sides because a triangle has 180 degrees, and we can divide any polygon into triangles.
   * **Applying the Formula:** For a hexagon (n=6), the sum of the interior angles is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.
   * **Finding One Angle:** Since a regular hexagon has six equal angles, each angle measures 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.

3. **Finding the Measure of Angle x:**

   * **Understanding the Relationship:** Angle x is formed by two lines drawn from the center of the hexagon to two adjacent vertices. These lines divide the hexagon into six congruent triangles.

The image shows a circle with two secant lines intersecting outside the circle. One secant line has a length of 15, and the part of the secant line outside the circle has a length of 12. The other secant line has a length of x, and the part of the secant line outside the circle has a length of 8. The problem asks us to find the value of x.

## The Solution:

To solve this problem, we can use the **Secant-Secant Theorem**. This theorem states that when two secant lines intersect outside a circle, the product of the lengths of one secant line and its external segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the other secant line and its external segment.

**Formula:**

*  a * (a + b) = c * (c + d)

Where:

* a = length of the external segment of the first secant line
* b = length of the internal segment of the first secant line
* c = length of the external segment of the second secant line
* d = length of the internal segment of the second secant line

**Plugging in the numbers:**

* a = 12
* b = 15
* c = 8
* d = x

So, the equation becomes:

* 12 * (12 + 15) = 8 * (8 + x)

**Solving for x:**

1. Simplify both sides of the equation:

* **Measure of Arc AD:**  Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we know that the measure of angle ABD is half the measure of arc AD. So, the measure of arc AD is 2 * 50 degrees = 100 degrees.

**Step 3: Apply the Central Angle Theorem**

* **Angle AOB:** Angle AOB is a central angle that intercepts arc AD. Since the measure of arc AD is 100 degrees, the measure of angle AOB is also 100 degrees.
