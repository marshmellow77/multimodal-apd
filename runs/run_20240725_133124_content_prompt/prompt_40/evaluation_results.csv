955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"<PROBLEM> The problem asks for the measure of angle ADE in a regular pentagon ABCDE inscribed in a circle with center O. </PROBLEM>
<SOLUTION>
* <STEP> Find the measure of each interior angle of the regular pentagon. </STEP>
* <REASON> Since the pentagon is regular, all its interior angles are equal. We can use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon to find the measure of each angle. </REASON>
* <FORMULA> The sum of interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2) * 180 degrees. For a pentagon (n=5), the sum is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees. Therefore, each interior angle of the regular pentagon measures 540/5 = 108 degrees. </FORMULA>
