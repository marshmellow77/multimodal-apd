**1. Understand the Properties**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Parallel Lines:** When parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.

**2. Apply the Properties**

* **Angle D:** Since CD is the diameter, ∠D intercepts a semicircle.  Therefore, ∠D is a right angle, and its measure is 90°.
* **Angle AOD:**  ∠D and ∠AOD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°). So, ∠AOD = 180° - 90° = 90°.
* **Angle EOA:**  Since DE ∥ OA, ∠EOA and ∠AOD are corresponding angles and are equal. Therefore, ∠EOA = 90°.
* **Angle COE:**  ∠EOA and ∠COE are supplementary angles. So, ∠COE = 180° - 90° = 90°.
* **Angle C:**  ∠C intercepts the same arc as ∠COE, which is a semicircle. Therefore, ∠C is also a right angle and its measure is 90°.

To solve this, we need to consider the forces exerted on particle 3 by each of the other particles and then sum up the x-components of these forces.

**1. Forces on particle 3:**

* **Force due to particle 1:**  The force between particle 1 and particle 3 is attractive because they have opposite charges. This force acts along the diagonal of the square.
* **Force due to particle 2:** The force between particle 2 and particle 3 is repulsive because they have the same charge. This force acts horizontally to the right.

F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
```

where:

* F is the magnitude of the electrostatic force
* k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)

**Step 1: Identify the relevant triangles**

We can see that triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with right angle at D.  We are asked to find the length of AD, which is one of the legs of this triangle.

**Step 2: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs).

In our case, BC is the hypotenuse, and AD and DC are the legs.  We can write this as:

BC² = AD² + DC²

**Step 3: Determine the lengths of BC and DC**

* **BC:**  We can count the grid squares to find the length of BC.  It spans 4 squares horizontally and 3 squares vertically.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem again, we can find BC:

BC² = 4² + 3² = 16 + 9 = 25
BC = √25 = 5

* **DC:**  Similarly, we can count the grid squares to find the length of DC.  It spans 3 squares horizontally.  Therefore, DC = 3.

**Step 4: Substitute the values into the Pythagorean Theorem**

We know BC = 5 and DC = 3.  Substituting these values into the equation from Step 2:

5² = AD² + 3²

**Step 5: Solve for AD**

25 = AD² + 9
AD² = 25 - 9 = 16
AD = √16 = 4

**Step 2: Identify key properties**

* **Tangents from a point:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.
* **Tangent-radius property:** A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of contact. Therefore, OA ⊥ AC and OB ⊥ BD.

**Step 3: Apply the properties to find the perimeter**

* Since OA ⊥ AC and OB ⊥ BD, we have two right-angled triangles: △OAC and △OBD.
* In △OAC, OA is the radius of the circle and AC is a tangent. Therefore, OA = OC (radius) and AC = CD (tangents from a point).
* Similarly, in △OBD, OB = OD (radius) and BD = CD (tangents from a point).

We are given a triangle ABC with a point D inside it. We know that CD bisects angle ACB, BD is perpendicular to CD, and angle A is equal to angle ABD. We are also given that angle DBC is 54 degrees.

**Step 2: Use the angle bisector property**

Since CD bisects angle ACB, we know that angle ACD is equal to angle BCD.

**Step 3: Use the fact that BD is perpendicular to CD**

Since BD is perpendicular to CD, we know that angle BDC is 90 degrees.

**Step 4: Use the angle sum property of triangles**

In triangle BDC, we have:

angle BDC + angle DBC + angle BCD = 180 degrees

Substituting the known values, we get:

**Step 1: Understand the properties of medians and midpoints.**

* **Median:** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
* **Midpoint:** The midpoint of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts.

**Step 2: Apply the property of medians.**

Since AD is the median of triangle ABC, it divides triangle ABC into two triangles with equal areas: triangle ABD and triangle ACD.

Since $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$, we know that $JQ$ is the angle bisector of $\angle J$.  Therefore, $\angle JQN = \angle JQP$.  Also, since $QP$ and $QM$ are tangents to the inscribed circle, we know that $QP = QM$.  Therefore, $\triangle JQP \cong \triangle JQM$ by SAS.  This means that $JQ = JM$.

We can find $JM$ using the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $QMN$:

$$JM = \sqrt{QM^2 + MN^2} = \sqrt{9^2 + MN^2}.$$

To find $MN$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $LMN$:

$$MN = \sqrt{LN^2 - LM^2} = \sqrt{LN^2 - 9^2}.$$

We can find $LN$ using the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $JLN$:

$$LN = \sqrt{JL^2 + JN^2} = \sqrt{16.5^2 + JN^2}.$$

To find $JN$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $JNP$:

$$JN = \sqrt{JP^2 + NP^2} = \sqrt{JP^2 + (JN - MN)^2}.$$

We can solve for $JN$ in this equation, but it will be a quadratic equation.  Instead, we can use the fact that $JP = JM$ to simplify the equation:

$$JN = \sqrt{JM^2 + (JN - MN)^2}.$$

Substituting the expressions we found for $JM$ and $MN$, we get:

$$JN = \sqrt{(\sqrt{9^2 + MN^2})^2 + (JN - \sqrt{LN^2 - 9^2})^2}.$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$JN = \sqrt{81 + LN^2 - 9^2 + JN^2 - 2JN\sqrt{LN^2 - 9^2} + LN^2 - 9^2}.$$

$$JN = \sqrt{2LN^2 + JN^2 - 2JN\sqrt{LN^2 - 9^2} - 18}.$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$JN^2 = 2LN^2 + JN^2 - 2JN\sqrt{LN^2 - 9^2} - 18.$$

$$2JN\sqrt{LN^2 - 9^2} = 2LN^2 - 18.$$

$$JN\sqrt{LN^2 - 9^2} = LN^2 - 9.$$

$$JN^2 (LN^2 - 9^2) = (LN^2 - 9)^2.$$

$$JN^2 LN^2 - 81JN^2 = LN^4 - 18LN^2 + 81.$$

Substituting $LN^2 = 16.5^2 + JN^2$, we get:

**Step 1: Understand the properties of a perpendicular bisector.**

A perpendicular bisector of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts and forms a right angle with the segment.

**Step 2: Apply the properties to the given information.**

Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

**Step 3: Use the perimeter information to find AE.**

The perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, which means AC + CE + AE = 13. We know that AC = AD + DC = 3 + DC. We also know that CE = BE - BC.

**Step 4: Express the perimeter of triangle ACE in terms of DC and BE.**

Substituting the values we found in Step 3, we get: (3 + DC) + (BE - BC) + AE = 13.

**Step 5: Simplify the equation and solve for AE.**

Combining like terms, we get: AE + DC + BE - BC = 10. Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that BE = BC. Therefore, the equation simplifies to: AE + DC = 10.

The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC. We know that AB = 6, BC = BE, and AC = AD + DC = 3 + DC.

**Step 7: Substitute the values and simplify.**

The perimeter of triangle ABC is 6 + BE + (3 + DC) = 9 + BE + DC. Since BE = BC, we can rewrite this as 9 + BC + DC.

**Step 8: Use the equation from Step 5 to find the perimeter.**

From Step 5, we know that AE + DC = 10. Since AE = AC - CE = (3 + DC) - (BE - BC) = 3 + DC - BE + BC = 3 + 2DC, we can substitute this into the equation from Step 5 to get: (3 + 2DC) + DC = 10.

**Step 9: Solve for DC.**

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3 + 3DC = 10. Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get: 3DC = 7. Dividing both sides by 3, we get: DC = 7/3.

We are given that the area of the circle is $18\pi$ square units.  Substituting this into the formula, we get:

This means that:

AD/AC = DE/DC

We know DE = 3 and AC = 4. We can substitute these values into the equation:

AD/4 = 3/DC

To find DC, we can cross-multiply:

AD * DC = 12

We don't know the value of AD, but we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find it in triangle ADE:

**Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²**

In triangle ADE, we know DE = 3 and AE is a part of AB. We need to find AD.

Let's assume AE = x. Then, AB = x + BE.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ADE:

3² + x² = AD²

AD² = 9 + x²

Now, we can substitute this value of AD² in the equation AD * DC = 12:

(9 + x²) * DC = 12

We still need to find x (AE) to solve for DC.

Since triangles ADE and ADC are similar, we can use the ratio of their corresponding sides:

AE/AC = DE/DC

x/4 = 3/DC

Cross-multiplying:

x * DC = 12

Now we have two equations:

(9 + x²) * DC = 12
x * DC = 12

We can solve for x and DC by solving these equations simultaneously.

Dividing the first equation by the second equation:

(9 + x²)/x = 1

9 + x² = x

x² - x + 9 = 0

This quadratic equation doesn't have real roots. This means there's an error in the problem statement or the given information is inconsistent.

Therefore, we cannot find the area of triangle ADC with the given information.

The problem involves an inscribed angle (∠ACB) and a central angle (∠AOB). We can use the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

Since ∠ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AB, we have:

**Step 3: Solve for the central angle**

We are given that ∠ACB = 25°. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

We are given a triangle ABC with two internal angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. We know that angle A is 110 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle BOC.

**Step 2: Apply the angle bisector theorem**

The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.

In our case, OB bisects angle ABC, so we can write:

```
AB/BC = AO/CO
```

Similarly, OC bisects angle ACB, so we can write:

```
AC/BC = AO/BO

**Step 3: Use the angle sum property of triangles**

The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.

684,$\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$. Find $x$.,55,"**Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**

The problem involves two chords intersecting inside a circle. We can use the Intersecting Chords Theorem, which states that the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

**Step 2: Apply the theorem.**

In this case, the angle formed by the intersection of chords $\overline{GH}$ and $\overline{KJ}$ is 83°. The intercepted arcs are $\stackrel{\frown}{GJ}$ and $\stackrel{\frown}{KH}$. We know that $\stackrel{\frown}{KH}$ is (2x - 27)°.

**Step 3: Set up an equation.**

Using the Intersecting Chords Theorem, we can write the equation:

83° = (1/2) * [m(GJ) + m(KH)]

**Step 4: Solve for m(GJ).**

Since the entire circle measures 360°, we can find m(GJ) by subtracting m(KH) from 360°:

m(GJ) = 360° - (2x - 27)° = 387° - 2x

**Step 5: Substitute and solve for x.**

Substitute the values of m(GJ) and m(KH) into the equation from Step 3:

83° = (1/2) * [(387° - 2x) + (2x - 27)°]

Simplify the equation:

83° = (1/2) * (360°)

83° = 180°

512,What is the y coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle of uniform areal density shown in Figure 9-C?,0.24,"The y coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle is **a/3**.

Here's how we arrive at this answer:

1. **Understanding the Concept:** The center of mass of a body is the point where the entire mass of the body can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object like a triangle, the center of mass lies along its axis of symmetry.

2. **Symmetry:** The isosceles right triangle in the image is symmetrical about the y-axis. Therefore, the center of mass will lie on the y-axis.

3. **Dividing the Triangle:** Imagine dividing the triangle into infinitesimally small horizontal strips. Each strip has a mass proportional to its area.

4. **Center of Mass of a Strip:** The center of mass of each strip lies at its midpoint. The y-coordinate of the midpoint of a strip at a distance y from the base is y/2.

5. **Weighted Average:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the entire triangle is the weighted average of the y-coordinates of the centers of mass of all the strips. The weight of each strip is its mass, which is proportional to its area.

6. **Integration:** To find the weighted average, we need to integrate the product of the y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip and its area over the entire height of the triangle.

7. **Area of a Strip:** The area of a strip at a distance y from the base is approximately equal to the width of the triangle at that height (which is 2(a-y)) multiplied by the infinitesimal thickness dy.

8. **Setting up the Integral:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass (y_cm) can be calculated using the following integral:

   y_cm = (∫(y/2) * 2(a-y) dy) / (∫2(a-y) dy)

   where the integration is performed from y = 0 to y = a (the height of the triangle).

9. **Solving the Integral:**

   - Simplifying the integrand: y_cm = (∫(ay - y^2) dy) / (∫(a - y) dy)
   - Integrating: y_cm = [(ay^2/2 - y^3/3) / (ay - y^2/2)] from y = 0 to y = a
   - Evaluating the limits: y_cm = [(a^3/2 - a^3/3) / (a^2 - a^2/2)]
   - Simplifying: y_cm = (a^3/6) / (a^2/2) = a/3

Therefore, the y-coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle is **a/3**.

252,Consider the infinitely long chain of resistors shown below. What is the resistance between terminals a and b if R=1?,0.73,"The resistance between terminals a and b can be found by considering the infinite nature of the circuit.  Here's how to approach the problem:

1. **Symmetry:** Notice that the circuit is symmetrical.  If we cut the circuit at any point along the horizontal line, the portion to the right of the cut will look identical to the portion to the left.

2. **Equivalent Resistance:** Let's call the equivalent resistance between terminals a and b as 'R_eq'.  Now, consider the portion of the circuit to the right of the first vertical resistor. This portion also has an equivalent resistance of 'R_eq'.

3. **Simplifying the Circuit:**  We can simplify the circuit by considering the following:
    * The two resistors in the first vertical branch are in series, giving a combined resistance of 2R.
    * This combined resistance (2R) is in parallel with the horizontal resistor (R).
    * The equivalent resistance of this parallel combination is given by: 1/(1/2R + 1/R) = 2R/3.

4. **Recursive Relationship:** Now, the equivalent resistance 'R_eq' can be expressed as the sum of the resistance of the simplified portion (2R/3) and the equivalent resistance of the remaining infinite chain (R_eq):
    R_eq = (2R/3) + R_eq

5. **Solving for R_eq:** Solving this equation for R_eq, we get:
    R_eq - R_eq = 2R/3
    0 = 2R/3
    This equation has no solution, which means our assumption that R_eq is finite is incorrect.

6. **Infinite Resistance:** The fact that we get a contradiction implies that the equivalent resistance between terminals a and b is infinite. This makes sense because the infinite chain of resistors will continue to add resistance, no matter how far we extend the circuit.

**Final Answer:** The resistance between terminals a and b is infinite.

* We are given a triangle ABC with an angle bisector CD and another line segment BE intersecting at point F.
* CG is perpendicular to AB, forming a right angle at G.
* We know ∠ACG = 32°.
* We need to find ∠BFC.

**2. Using Angle Properties**

* **Angle Bisector Property:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Therefore, ∠ACD = ∠BCD.
* **Right Angle Property:**  ∠CGD = 90°.
* **Angle Sum Property of a Triangle:** The sum of all angles in a triangle is 180°.

**3. Solving for Angles**

* **Step 1:** In triangle ACG, we have:
    * ∠ACG = 32° (given)
    * ∠CGD = 90° (right angle)
    * Using the angle sum property, ∠CAG = 180° - 32° - 90° = 58°.

* **Step 2:** Since CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, we have:
    * ∠ACD = ∠BCD = (1/2) ∠ACB.

* **Step 3:** In triangle ACF, we have:
    * ∠CAF = 58° (calculated above)
    * ∠ACF = ∠ACD (angle bisector property)
    * Using the angle sum property, ∠AFC = 180° - 58° - ∠ACD.

* **Step 4:** In triangle BCF, we have:
    * ∠BCF = ∠BCD (angle bisector property)
    * ∠BFC = 180° - ∠BCF - ∠CBF (angle sum property)

**4. Finding ∠BFC**

Since we don't have enough information to directly calculate ∠CBF, we need to find a way to express ∠BFC in terms of known angles.

* **Step 5:** Notice that ∠AFC and ∠BFC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°). Therefore:
    * ∠BFC = 180° - ∠AFC.

* **Step 6:** Substitute the expression for ∠AFC from Step 3:
    * ∠BFC = 180° - (180° - 58° - ∠ACD) = 58° + ∠ACD.

* **Step 7:** Since ∠ACD = (1/2) ∠ACB, we can write:
    * ∠BFC = 58° + (1/2) ∠ACB.

**5. Final Answer**

We cannot determine the exact value of ∠BFC without knowing the measure of ∠ACB. However, we have expressed ∠BFC in terms of ∠ACB:

**∠BFC = 58° + (1/2) ∠ACB**

955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"The problem asks for the measure of angle ADE in a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle. Here's how to solve it:

**1. Understanding Regular Polygons**

* A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal.
* The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2) * 180 degrees.

**2. Finding the Interior Angle of a Regular Pentagon**

* A pentagon has 5 sides (n = 5).
* The sum of its interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.
* Each interior angle of a regular pentagon is 540 / 5 = 108 degrees.

**3. Using Central Angles**

* The central angle of a regular polygon is formed by connecting the center of the polygon to two consecutive vertices.
* Since the pentagon is inscribed in a circle, the central angle subtends an arc equal to one-fifth of the circle's circumference.
* Therefore, the central angle of a regular pentagon is 360 / 5 = 72 degrees.

**4. Finding Angle ADE**

* Angle ADE is an interior angle of the pentagon, which we know is 108 degrees.
* Angle AOE is a central angle of the pentagon, which we know is 72 degrees.
* Triangle AOE is isosceles because OA and OE are radii of the circle. Therefore, angles OAE and OEA are equal.
* The sum of the angles in triangle AOE is 180 degrees.
* So, angle OAE = (180 - 72) / 2 = 54 degrees.
* Finally, angle ADE = angle OAE + angle OED = 54 + 54 = 108 degrees.

**Answer:** The measure of angle ADE is **108 degrees**.

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"The angles x and 70 degrees form a linear pair, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. 

Therefore, x + 70 = 180.

Subtracting 70 from both sides, we get x = 110.

We are given that y is equal to the square of x.

Therefore, y = x^2 = 110^2 = 12100.

The final answer is y = 12100.",False,0,2.6485838890075684,453.0
