643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem:

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle C (∠C) in a circle with diameter CD, where chord DE is parallel to chord OA, and the measure of angle D (∠D) is 50 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify key relationships:**
    * **Diameter and Circle:**  The diameter of a circle passes through the center and divides the circle into two equal halves.
    * **Parallel Lines:** When two lines are parallel, the alternate interior angles are equal.
    * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Apply the relationships:**
    * Since CD is the diameter, ∠COD is a straight angle, meaning it measures 180 degrees.
    * Because DE || OA, ∠D = ∠A (alternate interior angles). Therefore, ∠A = 50 degrees.
    * ∠COA is the central angle intercepting the same arc as ∠A.  By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, ∠COA = 2 * ∠A = 2 * 50 degrees = 100 degrees.

3. **Calculate ∠C:**
    * We know ∠COD = 180 degrees and ∠COA = 100 degrees.
    * Therefore, ∠C = ∠COD - ∠COA = 180 degrees - 100 degrees = 80 degrees.

## Answer:

The degree of ∠C is **80 degrees**.

   * cos(60°) = 4 / *h*

3. **Solve for *h*:**
   * *h* = 4 / cos(60°)

4. **Calculate the value of cos(60°):**  The cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2.

5. **Substitute and solve:**
   * *h* = 4 / (1/2)
   * *h* = 4 * 2

If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"1. **Problem:** We need to find the radius of the smaller circle, given that the radius of the larger circle is 4 and that the centers of both circles lie on the same line.

2. **Solution Steps:**

* **Visualize:** Imagine drawing a line segment from point P (center of the larger circle) to point R (on the edge of the larger circle). This line segment represents the radius of the larger circle, which is 4.
* **Key Observation:** Notice that the line segment PR also passes through point Q (center of the smaller circle). This means that the radius of the smaller circle is simply the distance between points Q and R.
* **Deduction:** Since the radius of the larger circle is 4, and the smaller circle is entirely contained within the larger circle, the radius of the smaller circle must be less than 4.
* **Answer Choices:** Looking at the answer choices, we can eliminate options (C), (D), and (E) because they are greater than or equal to 4.
* **Final Step:** The only remaining options are (A) 1 and (B) 2. Since the smaller circle is visibly smaller than half the size of the larger circle, the radius of the smaller circle must be less than half the radius of the larger circle (which is 2).

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AOE, given that line AB and CD intersect at point O, ray OE bisects angle BOC, and angle AOD is 70 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relevant angles:** We are given that ∠AOD = 70°. Since ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), we can find ∠BOD:
   ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.

2. **Understand angle bisectors:** We are told that ray OE bisects ∠BOC. This means that ∠BOE and ∠COE are equal in measure.

3. **Apply the angle bisector property:** Since ∠BOD = 110° and ray OE bisects ∠BOC, we can find ∠BOE:

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relevant triangles:** We can see that triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at D. This is because AD is perpendicular to BC.

2. **Determine the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC:**
    * **AB:**  Count the grid squares along the diagonal from B to A. We find that AB has a length of 5 units.
    * **BC:** Count the grid squares along the horizontal line from B to C. We find that BC has a length of 4 units.

The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle PCD, given that PA and PB are tangents to circle O at points A and B respectively, CD is tangent to circle O, and PA = 8.0.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Tangent Properties:**
   * **Tangent-Radius Property:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°.
   * **Equal Tangent Segments:** Tangent segments drawn from an external point to a circle are congruent. This means AC = AD and BC = BD.

2. **Analyzing the Triangle:**
   * We know PA = 8.0, and since AC = AD, we have AC = AD = 4.0.

    * **Step 2: Find angle BDC.**  We know that BD is perpendicular to CD, which means angle BDC is a right angle (90 degrees).

    * **Step 3: Find angle CBD.**  We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find angle CBD in triangle BCD:
        * ∠CBD + ∠BCD + ∠BDC = 180°
        * ∠CBD + 1/2 * ∠ACB + 90° = 180°
        * ∠CBD = 90° - 1/2 * ∠ACB

    * **Step 4: Find angle ABD.** We know that angle DBC is 54 degrees, and we just found angle CBD.  We can use these to find angle ABD:
        * ∠ABD = ∠DBC + ∠CBD

        * 1/2 * ∠ACB + ∠ABC = 36°

    * **Step 7: Find angle ABC.** We know that angle ABD is equal to angle A, and we can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find angle ABC in triangle ABD:
        * ∠A + ∠ABD + ∠ADB = 180°

The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle ABC, given that:

* AB = 6
* The perpendicular bisector of AB intersects AB at point D and BC at point E.
* The perimeter of triangle ACE is 13.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Perpendicular Bisector:** The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line that cuts the segment into two equal parts and is perpendicular to the segment. This means that AD = DB = 3.

2. **Using the Properties of Perpendicular Bisectors:** Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AE = BE.

3. **Finding the Length of AC:** We know the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, and we know AC = AE + EC. Since AE = BE, we can write the perimeter as: 13 = AE + EC + AC = 2AE + EC.

4. **Finding the Length of BC:** We know that BC = BE + EC. Since AE = BE, we can write BC = AE + EC.

5. **Finding the Perimeter of Triangle ABC:** The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC. Substituting the values we found:

Perimeter of ABC = AB + BC + AC = 6 + (AE + EC) + (2AE + EC) = 6 + 3AE + 2EC.

6. **Using the Perimeter of Triangle ACE:** We know that 13 = 2AE + EC.  Substituting this into the perimeter of triangle ABC:

Perimeter of ABC = 6 + 3AE + 2EC = 6 + (13 - EC) + 2EC = 19 + EC.

7. **Finding the Length of EC:** We need to find the length of EC to calculate the perimeter of triangle ABC.  Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to directly find EC.  We need more information about the triangle or the relationship between the sides.

The image shows a parallelogram ABCD with diagonals intersecting at point F. The angle bisector of ∠ABC intersects AD at point E, and the angle bisector of ∠BCD intersects AD at point F. Given that AB = 3 and AD = 4, we need to find the length of EF.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Properties of Parallelograms:**
   * Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel. Therefore, AD = BC = 4.
   * Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal. Therefore, ∠ABC = ∠ADC.

2. **Using Angle Bisectors:**
   * Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE.
   * Since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, we have ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

3. **Applying the Angle Sum Property:**
   * In triangle ABE, we have ∠BAE + ∠ABE + ∠AEB = 180°.
   * In triangle CBE, we have ∠CBE + ∠BCE + ∠CEB = 180°.
   * Since ∠ABE = ∠CBE and ∠BAE = ∠BCE (opposite angles of parallelogram), we can conclude that ∠AEB = ∠CEB.

4. **Identifying Similar Triangles:**
   * Triangles ABE and CBE share a common angle (∠ABE = ∠CBE) and have equal corresponding angles (∠AEB = ∠CEB). Therefore, triangles ABE and CBE are similar.

5. **Using Proportions in Similar Triangles:**
   * Since triangles ABE and CBE are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. This means:
     * AE/CE = AB/CB = 3/4

6. **Finding the Length of AE and CE:**
   * We know AD = 4 and AE + CE = AD = 4.
   * Using the proportion AE/CE = 3/4, we can solve for AE and CE:
     * AE = (3/7) * 4 = 12/7
     * CE = (4/7) * 4 = 16/7

7. **Applying the Midpoint Theorem:**
   * Since E and F are the midpoints of AD and BC respectively, EF is parallel to AB and half its length. Therefore:
     * EF = (1/2) * AB = (1/2) * 3 = 3/2

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle EOB, given that:

* Lines AB and CD intersect at point O.
* OD bisects angle AOE.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Bisectors:**  A bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Since OD bisects angle AOE, we know that angle AOD is equal to angle DOE.

2. **Identifying Vertical Angles:** Angles BOC and AOD are vertical angles. Vertical angles are always equal. Therefore, angle AOD is also 50 degrees.

3. **Using the Angle Addition Postulate:** The Angle Addition Postulate states that the measure of a larger angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its smaller adjacent angles.  We can apply this to angle AOE: 
    *  ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠DOE

4. **Substituting and Solving:** Since ∠AOD = ∠DOE = 50 degrees, we can substitute:
    * ∠AOE = 50° + 50° = 100°

5. **Finding ∠EOB:**  Angles AOE and EOB are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore:

2. **Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the right angles.** Notice that angles A and B are right angles. This means that we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AC.

* **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem.** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In triangle ABC, AC is the hypotenuse, AB is one leg, and BC is the other leg. So, we have:

We need to find the length of a side of a square inscribed in a circle with an area of 18π square units.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Find the radius of the circle:**
   * We know the area of the circle is 18π square units.
   * The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.
   * We can plug in the given area and solve for the radius:
     * 18π = πr²
     * r² = 18
     * r = √18 = 3√2

2. **Relate the radius to the side of the square:**
   * The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
   * The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is 2 * 3√2 = 6√2.

3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side of the square:**
   * The diagonal of the square divides it into two right-angled triangles.
   * The diagonal is the hypotenuse of these triangles, and the sides of the square are the legs.

   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Diameter as a central angle:** A diameter of a circle intercepts an arc of 180 degrees.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   * Angle ADC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AC.
   * Therefore, the measure of arc AC is twice the measure of angle ADC: arc AC = 2 * 26 degrees = 52 degrees.

3. **Apply the Diameter as a Central Angle:**
   * Diameter AB intercepts arc ACB, which is a semicircle.
   * Therefore, the measure of arc ACB is 180 degrees.

4. **Find the measure of arc BC:**
   * Since arc AC + arc BC = arc ACB, we can find the measure of arc BC: arc BC = arc ACB - arc AC = 180 degrees - 52 degrees = 128 degrees.

5. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem again:**

The problem asks us to find the length of line segment CD in a right triangle ABC, where:

* ∠ACB = 90° (meaning it's a right angle)
* D is the midpoint of line segment AB
* AB = 10

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relevant geometric concepts:**  We are dealing with a right triangle and the midpoint of its hypotenuse. This suggests we can use the concept of the **midpoint theorem** which states: ""The line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.""

2. **Apply the midpoint theorem:** Since D is the midpoint of AB, we can apply the midpoint theorem to triangle ABC. This means line segment CD is parallel to line segment BC and half its length.

3. **Find the length of BC:**  We know AB = 10 and ∠ACB = 90°. Since it's a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BC:

    *  AB² = AC² + BC²
    *  10² = AC² + BC²
    *  BC² = 10² - AC²

    We don't know the length of AC, so we can't directly calculate BC. However, we know CD is half the length of BC.

4. **Calculate CD:** Since CD is half the length of BC, we can write:

    * CD = BC / 2

    We don't have the exact value of BC, but we can express CD in terms of AC:

    * CD = (√(10² - AC²)) / 2

## Answer:

The length of CD is (√(10² - AC²)) / 2. We cannot find a numerical answer without knowing the length of AC.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle ACB, given that PA and PB are tangents to circle O, AC is the diameter of circle O, and angle P is 50 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Tangent Properties:**  We know that a tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. Therefore, ∠OAP = ∠OBP = 90 degrees.

2. **Quadrilateral Properties:**  Consider quadrilateral OAPB. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360 degrees. We know ∠OAP = ∠OBP = 90 degrees and ∠P = 50 degrees. Therefore, ∠AOB = 360 - 90 - 90 - 50 = 130 degrees.

3. **Central Angle Theorem:** The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.  ∠ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AB, and ∠AOB is the central angle intercepting the same arc. Therefore, ∠ACB = 1/2 * ∠AOB = 1/2 * 130 = 65 degrees.

We need to find the lengths of the diagonals of a rhombus given that one diagonal is twice as long as the other and the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Properties of a Rhombus:** A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length. Its diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

2. **Using the Area Formula:** The area of a rhombus is given by half the product of its diagonals. Let's denote the shorter diagonal as 'd' and the longer diagonal as '2d'.  Therefore, the area of the rhombus is:

   Area = (1/2) * d * 2d = d²

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:** We know that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of its side.  Therefore, the area of the square with side length 8 is 8² = 64.

2. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In this case, the hypotenuse is the side with length 14, and the other two sides are 8 and ""A"".

3. **Applying the Theorem:** We can write the Pythagorean Theorem for this triangle as: 14² = 8² + A²

4. **Solving for A:**
    * Simplify the equation: 196 = 64 + A²
    * Subtract 64 from both sides: 132 = A²
    * Take the square root of both sides: √132 = A

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Understanding Perimeter:** The perimeter of a triangle is the total length of all its sides. To find the perimeter, we add the lengths of all three sides.

   * **Triangle Inequality Theorem:** The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. This is crucial for determining possible perimeters.

   * **Finding Possible Perimeters:** Let's consider the third side of the triangle, which we'll call 'x'.  Applying the Triangle Inequality Theorem:
      *  x + 7 > 12

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1: Understand Angle Bisectors**
        * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.
        * Since OB bisects angle B, we have ∠ABO = ∠OBC.
        * Similarly, since OC bisects angle C, we have ∠ACO = ∠OCB.

    * **Step 2: Apply Angle Sum Property of a Triangle**
        * The sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
        * In triangle ABC, we have: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
        * Substituting the given value of ∠A, we get: 110° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
        * Therefore, ∠B + ∠C = 70°

    * **Step 3: Focus on Triangle BOC**
        * In triangle BOC, we have: ∠BOC + ∠OBC + ∠OCB = 180°
        * From Step 1, we know ∠OBC = 1/2 ∠B and ∠OCB = 1/2 ∠C.
        * Substituting these values, we get: ∠BOC + (1/2)∠B + (1/2)∠C = 180°

    * **Step 4: Solve for ∠BOC**
        * From Step 2, we know ∠B + ∠C = 70°.
        * Substituting this into the equation from Step 3, we get: ∠BOC + (1/2)(70°) = 180°
        * Simplifying, we get: ∠BOC + 35° = 180°
        * Therefore, ∠BOC = 180° - 35° = 145°

The problem asks us to find the difference between angle 1 and angle 2 in the given diagram. We know that lines a and b are parallel, triangle ABC is a right triangle with angle C = 90 degrees, and angle B = 58 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify corresponding angles:** Since lines a and b are parallel, angle 1 and angle 2 are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are equal when formed by parallel lines intersected by a transversal.

2. **Find angle A:** We know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle ABC:

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the points M and N on the sides BC and CD respectively, such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized. This means we need to find the shortest possible path from A to M to N and back to A.

2. **Using the Reflection Property:**  The shortest path between two points is a straight line. We can use the reflection property to find the shortest path. Reflect point A across line BC to get point A'. Similarly, reflect point A across line CD to get point A''.

3. **Finding the Shortest Path:** Now, the shortest path from A to M to N and back to A is equivalent to the straight line path from A' to A'' passing through M and N. This is because the distance from A to M is equal to the distance from A' to M, and the distance from A to N is equal to the distance from A'' to N.

4. **Calculating the Angles:** Since ∠BAD = 120°, ∠A'BM = ∠ABM = 60° (due to reflection). Similarly, ∠A''DN = ∠ADN = 60°. Therefore, ∠A'MA'' = ∠A'BM + ∠ABM + ∠A''DN + ∠ADN = 60° + 60° + 60° + 60° = 240°.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle E in the given diagram. We are given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Congruent Triangles:** Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, we know that their corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle A = angle D = 22 degrees.

2. **Angle Bisector Property:** CD bisects angle BCA, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts. Therefore, angle BCD = angle ACD.

3. **Angle Sum Property of a Triangle:** The sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Applying this to triangle ABC, we have: angle A + angle B + angle C = 180 degrees.

4. **Finding Angle C:** We know angle A = 22 degrees. Since angle C is bisected by CD, we can write angle C as 2 * angle ACD. Substituting these values into the angle sum property equation: 22 degrees + angle B + 2 * angle ACD = 180 degrees.

5. **Finding Angle ACD:** We are given that angle CGF = 88 degrees. Since angle CGF and angle ACD are vertically opposite angles, they are equal. Therefore, angle ACD = 88 degrees.

6. **Finding Angle B:** Substituting angle ACD = 88 degrees into the equation from step 4: 22 degrees + angle B + 2 * 88 degrees = 180 degrees.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Understanding Symmetry:** Symmetry means that if we fold the figure along the line of symmetry, the two halves will perfectly overlap. 
   * **Applying Symmetry:**
      * Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP.
      * Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, we know that ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.
   * **Finding Angles:**

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Equilateral Triangles:** An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal in length. This means that:

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle 2 in the given diagram. We know that lines l1 and l2 are parallel, angle 1 is 76 degrees, and the triangle contains a 30-degree angle.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify Corresponding Angles:** Since lines l1 and l2 are parallel, angle 1 and the angle inside the triangle that is adjacent to angle 2 are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are equal in measure.

2. **Find the Missing Angle in the Triangle:**  Therefore, the angle inside the triangle adjacent to angle 2 is also 76 degrees.

The problem asks us to find the value of x, given that the angle formed by a tangent and a chord is 30 degrees, and the angle formed by two chords inside the circle is (4x + 50) degrees and 3x degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:** The problem involves angles formed by tangents and chords, and angles formed by chords inside a circle. We need to use the following theorems:

    * **Theorem 1:** The angle formed by a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.
    * **Theorem 2:** The measure of an angle formed by two chords inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

2. **Apply Theorem 1:** The angle formed by the tangent and the chord is 30 degrees. This means the intercepted arc has a measure of 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.

3. **Apply Theorem 2:** The angle formed by the two chords inside the circle is (4x + 50) degrees. This angle intercepts the arc of 60 degrees (from step 2) and another arc. Let's call the measure of this other arc y degrees.  Therefore, we can write the equation:

    (4x + 50) = 1/2 (60 + y)

4. **Find the value of y:** The angle formed by the two chords inside the circle is also 3x degrees. This angle intercepts the same arc of 60 degrees (from step 2) and the arc of y degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

    3x = 1/2 (60 + y)

5. **Solve the system of equations:** We now have two equations with two unknowns (x and y):

    * (4x + 50) = 1/2 (60 + y)
    * 3x = 1/2 (60 + y)

    We can solve for y in both equations:

    * y = 8x + 40

    Now we can set the two expressions for y equal to each other:

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Understanding the Concept:** The center of mass of a body is the point where the entire mass of the body can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object like an isosceles right triangle, the center of mass lies along the line of symmetry.

    * **Divide the Triangle:** Imagine dividing the triangle into infinitesimally small horizontal strips. Each strip has a small mass dm.

    * **Center of Mass of a Strip:** The center of mass of each strip lies at its midpoint, which is at a distance y from the base of the triangle.

    * **Integration:** To find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of the entire triangle, we need to integrate the product of the mass of each strip (dm) and its y-coordinate, and then divide by the total mass of the triangle.

    * **Formula:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass (y_cm) is given by:

        y_cm = (∫y dm) / (∫dm)

    * **Calculating dm:** The mass of each strip is proportional to its area. The area of a strip is approximately equal to its width (dx) multiplied by its height (y). Since the areal density is uniform, the mass of the strip is:

        dm = ρ * (dx * y)

        where ρ is the areal density.

    * **Substituting dm:** Substituting the expression for dm in the formula for y_cm:

        y_cm = (∫y * ρ * (dx * y)) / (∫ρ * (dx * y))

    * **Simplifying:** The areal density ρ is constant and can be taken out of the integrals. Also, the integral of dx over the base of the triangle is simply the base length (2a). Therefore, the formula becomes:

        y_cm = (∫y^2 dy) / (∫y dy)

    * **Limits of Integration:** The limits of integration for y are from 0 to a (the height of the triangle).

    * **Evaluating the Integrals:**

        ∫y^2 dy = (y^3)/3 evaluated from 0 to a = (a^3)/3

        ∫y dy = (y^2)/2 evaluated from 0 to a = (a^2)/2

        y_cm = ((a^3)/3) / ((a^2)/2) = (2a)/3

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Understanding the Circuit:** The circuit consists of an infinite series of repeating units. Each unit has three resistors connected in parallel, and these units are connected in series.

    * **Simplifying the Circuit:**  We can simplify the circuit by focusing on one repeating unit. Let's call the equivalent resistance of one unit 'R_eq'.

    * **Parallel Resistors:** The three resistors in parallel within each unit have the same resistance 'R'. The equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel is calculated using the formula:

        1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R

        Therefore, R_parallel = R/3.

    * **Series Resistors:** Now, we have R_parallel in series with the rest of the infinite chain. This means the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit (R_eq) is equal to R_parallel plus the equivalent resistance of the remaining infinite chain.

        R_eq = R_parallel + R_eq

    * **Solving for R_eq:** We can now solve for R_eq:

        R_eq = R/3 + R_eq
        R_eq - R_eq = R/3
        0 = R/3

        This equation doesn't make sense! It seems like we've hit a dead end. However, this is because we've assumed that the equivalent resistance of the infinite chain is finite. In reality, the equivalent resistance of an infinite chain is infinite.

    * **Infinite Resistance:**  The infinite chain of resistors will always have a non-zero resistance, no matter how many times we simplify it. This is because we can always add another repeating unit, which will add more resistance to the circuit.

815,Find $m \angle N C L$,120,"## Problem:

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle NCL, denoted as  m∠NCL, in the given circle.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Concept:**  Angles around a point add up to 360 degrees. This means that the sum of all the angles at the center of the circle (point C) must equal 360 degrees.

2. **Setting up the Equation:** We can write an equation to represent this:
   m∠NCR + m∠RCL + m∠LCM + m∠MCN = 360°

3. **Substituting Values:** We are given the following angle measures:
   * m∠MCN = 60°
   * m∠NCR = (x - 1)°
   * m∠RCL = (3x + 5)°

   We need to find m∠NCL, which is the same as m∠LCM.

4. **Solving for x:** Substitute the known values into the equation:
   (x - 1)° + (3x + 5)° + m∠NCL + 60° = 360°

   Combine like terms:
   4x + 64° + m∠NCL = 360°

   Subtract 64° from both sides:
   4x + m∠NCL = 296°

   We still need to find the value of x to solve for m∠NCL.  Since we don't have enough information to directly solve for m∠NCL, we can assume that the angles around point C are all distinct. This means that m∠NCL is not equal to any of the other angles. Therefore, we can set m∠NCL equal to 0° to solve for x:

   4x + 0° = 296°
   4x = 296°
   x = 74°

5. **Finding m∠NCL:** Now that we know x = 74°, we can substitute it back into the equation for m∠NCL:

   4x + m∠NCL = 296°
   4(74°) + m∠NCL = 296°
   296° + m∠NCL = 296°
   m∠NCL = 0°

Therefore, the measure of angle NCL (m∠NCL) is **0°**.

The problem asks us to find the value of x in the given figure, where ABCDEF is a regular hexagon and O is its center.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Regular Hexagons:** A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles. 

2. **Interior Angle Formula:** The sum of the interior angles of any polygon with n sides is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees. For a hexagon (n=6), the sum of interior angles is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.

3. **Angle of a Regular Hexagon:** Since all angles in a regular hexagon are equal, each angle measures 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.

4. **Central Angle:**  Angle BOC is a central angle of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is regular, the central angle divides the hexagon into six congruent triangles. Therefore, angle BOC is 360 degrees / 6 = 60 degrees.

5. **Finding x:**  Angle BOC is the sum of angles BOA and AOC. Since triangle BOA is isosceles (BO = OA), angles BOA and BAO are equal.  Therefore, x = (120 degrees - 60 degrees) / 2 = 30 degrees.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle D (∠D) in the given figure. We are given that AB is the diameter of circle O, DB and DC are tangents to the circle at points B and C, and ∠ACE = 25°.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Tangent Properties:**
   * A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. Therefore, ∠OBD = ∠OCD = 90°.

2. **Identifying Key Angles:**
   * We are given ∠ACE = 25°.
   * Since ∠OBD = 90°, we can find ∠ABO = 90° - ∠BAO.
   * Similarly, ∠CDO = 90° - ∠CAO.

3. **Applying Angle Relationships:**

   * ∠CDO + ∠CAO + ∠OAC = 180° (angles in a triangle).
   * ∠BAO + ∠CAO = ∠BAC (angle addition).
   * ∠OAB + ∠OAC = ∠ACE = 25° (given).

4. **Solving for ∠D:**
   * Substituting the known values and relationships into the equations above, we get:

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1: Identify key angles and relationships.**
        * We know that ∠BTC is a right angle because CT is tangent to the semicircle at point T.
        * We also know that ∠ABC is a right angle because ABCD is a square.

    * **Step 2: Apply angle properties.**
        * Since ∠BTC is a right angle, we have ∠BTC = 90°.
        * Since ∠ABC is a right angle, we have ∠ABC = 90°.
        * The angles in a triangle add up to 180°. Therefore, in triangle BTC, we have ∠BTC + ∠CBT + ∠CTB = 180°.

    * **Step 3: Solve for the unknown angle.**
        * Substituting the known values, we get 90° + ∠CBT + ∠CTB = 180°.
        * Simplifying, we get ∠CBT + ∠CTB = 90°.
        * Since ∠CBT and ∠CTD are complementary angles (they add up to 90°), we have ∠CTD = 90° - ∠CBT.

    * **Step 4: Determine the measure of ∠CBT.**
        * Since ABCD is a square, all sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Therefore, ∠ABC = ∠BCD = 90°.
        * Since ∠BTC is a right angle, we have ∠BTC = 90°.
        * The angles in a triangle add up to 180°. Therefore, in triangle BTC, we have ∠BTC + ∠CBT + ∠CTB = 180°.

    * **Step 5: Calculate the measure of ∠CTD.**
        * Substituting the value of ∠CBT into the equation ∠CTD = 90° - ∠CBT, we get ∠CTD = 90° - (90° - ∠CTD).
        * Simplifying, we get ∠CTD = ∠CTD.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Theorem:** This problem uses the **Secant-Secant Theorem**, which states that when two secants intersect outside a circle, the product of the lengths of one secant and its external segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the other secant and its external segment.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle ∠BCD, given that AB is the diameter of circle O, points C and D lie on the circle, and ∠ABD = 50°.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify key relationships:**
    * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * **Diameter as a central angle:** A diameter of a circle intercepts an arc of 180°.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
    * Since AB is a diameter, ∠ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AB, which is 180°.
    * Therefore, ∠ACB = 1/2 * 180° = 90°.

3. **Find ∠ACD:**
    * We know ∠ABD = 50° and ∠ACB = 90°.
    * Since the angles in triangle ABC add up to 180°, we can find ∠ACD:

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Understanding the Diagram:** The diagram shows a circle with center S.  Line segment QS is a diameter of the circle, and line segment PR is a chord of the circle.  The arc PQR is a major arc, meaning it's larger than 180 degrees.  The arc PQ is a minor arc, meaning it's smaller than 180 degrees.

    * **Key Concept:**  A diameter of a circle divides the circle into two semicircles, each measuring 180 degrees.

    * **Applying the Concept:** Since QS is a diameter,  $m \widehat {PQS} = 180^\circ$.

    * **Finding the Measure of Arc PQ:** We can find the measure of arc PQ by subtracting the measure of arc QR from the measure of arc PQS:
        *  $m \widehat {PQ} = m \widehat {PQS} - m \widehat {QR}$
        *  $m \widehat {PQ} = 180^\circ - m \widehat {QR}$

    * **Finding the Measure of Arc QR:**  We know that $m \widehat {PQR} = 98^\circ$.  Since arc PQR is made up of arc PQ and arc QR, we can write:
        *  $m \widehat {PQR} = m \widehat {PQ} + m \widehat {QR}$
        *  $98^\circ = m \widehat {PQ} + m \widehat {QR}$

    * **Solving for the Measure of Arc PQ:**  Substituting the expression for $m \widehat {PQ}$ from step 4 into the equation from step 5, we get:
        *  $98^\circ = (180^\circ - m \widehat {QR}) + m \widehat {QR}$
        *  $98^\circ = 180^\circ$

    * **Simplifying the Equation:**  The $m \widehat {QR}$ terms cancel out, leaving us with:
        *  $98^\circ = 180^\circ$

    * **Final Step:**  This equation is not true, which means there's an error in the problem statement or the diagram.  It's impossible for the measure of arc PQR to be 98 degrees if QS is a diameter.

2. **Use the angle bisector property:**
    * CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, meaning ∠ACD = ∠BCD.
    * Since ∠CAG = 58°, we know ∠ACD = ∠BCD = (180° - ∠CAG) / 2 = (180° - 58°) / 2 = 61°.
