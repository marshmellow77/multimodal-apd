1. Since CD is the diameter of the circle, ∠CDE is a right angle (90 degrees).
2. Because DE || OA, ∠D = ∠A (alternate interior angles).
3. Therefore, ∠A = 50 degrees.
4. In triangle AOC, ∠A + ∠C + ∠O = 180 degrees.
5. Since ∠O is a central angle subtended by the diameter, ∠O = 180 degrees.
6. Substituting the values, we get 50 + ∠C + 180 = 180.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Congruent Triangles:** Since △ABC ≌ △DEF, we know that corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, ∠A = ∠D = 22°.

2. **Angle Bisector:** CD bisects ∠BCA, meaning ∠BCD = ∠ACD.

3. **Angle Sum Property:** The angles in a triangle add up to 180°. In △ABC, we have: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.

4. **Finding ∠C:**  Substituting the known values, we get: 22° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.  Since ∠B = ∠E (corresponding angles of congruent triangles), we can rewrite this as: 22° + ∠E + ∠C = 180°.

5. **Finding ∠BCD:**  ∠CGF is an exterior angle of △BCD.  The measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, ∠CGF = ∠BCD + ∠CBD.  Substituting the known values, we get: 88° = ∠BCD + ∠E.

6. **Solving for ∠E:**  We now have two equations:
    * 22° + ∠E + ∠C = 180°
    * 88° = ∠BCD + ∠E

7. **Using the Angle Bisector:** Since ∠BCD = ∠ACD, we can rewrite the second equation as: 88° = ∠ACD + ∠E.

8. **Combining Equations:**  Adding the two equations together, we get: 22° + ∠E + ∠C + 88° = ∠ACD + ∠E + 180°.  Simplifying, we get: 110° + ∠C = ∠ACD + 180°.

9. **Solving for ∠ACD:**  Since ∠C = ∠ACD + ∠BCD, we can substitute to get: 110° + (∠ACD + ∠BCD) = ∠ACD + 180°.  Simplifying, we get: 110° + ∠BCD = 180°.  Therefore, ∠BCD = 70°.

10. **Finding ∠E:**  Substituting ∠BCD = 70° into the equation 88° = ∠BCD + ∠E, we get: 88° = 70° + ∠E.  Solving for ∠E, we find ∠E = 18°.

4. **Angles in a Triangle:**  Angle COD, angle OCD, and angle ODC form the angles of triangle COD. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°. Therefore, angle ODC measures 180° - 130° - 25° = 25°.

5. **Isosceles Triangle:**  Triangle ODC is an isosceles triangle because OD and OC are radii of the circle. Therefore, angle ODC and angle OCD are equal, both measuring 25°.

* **Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem:** The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

**Applying the Theorems**

1. **Angle formed by tangent and chord:** The angle measuring (4x + 50)° is formed by a tangent and a chord.  Therefore, it's half the measure of the intercepted arc. Let's call this arc 'a'. So:
   (4x + 50)° = a/2

2. **Inscribed angle:** The angle measuring 3x° is an inscribed angle. It intercepts the same arc 'a'. So:

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Symmetry:** Due to the symmetry of the triangle, the center of mass lies along the y-axis.

2. **Dividing into Strips:** Imagine dividing the triangle into thin horizontal strips. Each strip has a mass proportional to its area.

3. **Center of Mass of a Strip:** The center of mass of each strip is at its midpoint, which is at a distance y/2 from the base of the triangle.

4. **Weighted Average:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the entire triangle is the weighted average of the y-coordinates of the centers of mass of all the strips. Since the triangle has uniform areal density, the weight of each strip is proportional to its area.

5. **Integration:** To find the weighted average, we can integrate the y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip multiplied by its area, and then divide by the total area of the triangle.

6. **Calculation:** The area of a strip at height y is (2a - 2y) * dy. The y-coordinate of its center of mass is y/2. Therefore, the integral for the y-coordinate of the center of mass is:

252,Consider the infinitely long chain of resistors shown below. What is the resistance between terminals a and b if R=1?,0.73,"The resistance between terminals a and b is **2**. Here's how to solve it:

1. **Symmetry:** The circuit is symmetrical. This means that the resistance between any two adjacent nodes is the same.

2. **Equivalent Resistance:**  Let's consider the resistance between points a and the first node to the right of a.  This resistance is the equivalent resistance of the following:
    * An R resistor in parallel with the rest of the infinite chain.

3. **Recursive Relationship:** Let's call the resistance between a and the first node to the right of a ""x"".  Since the circuit is infinite, the resistance between the first node to the right of a and the second node to the right of a is also ""x"".  Therefore, the equivalent resistance of the infinite chain starting from the first node to the right of a is also ""x"".

4. **Solving for x:** Now we can write an equation for ""x"" using the parallel resistance formula:
    * 1/x = 1/R + 1/x
    * 1/x - 1/x = 1/R
    * 0 = 1/R 
    * This is not possible, so we need to adjust our thinking.

5. **Adjusting the Equation:**  The problem is that we're assuming the resistance of the infinite chain is ""x"".  However, the infinite chain includes the initial R resistor.  Therefore, the correct equation is:
    * 1/x = 1/R + 1/(x + R)

6. **Solving for x:**
    * 1/x = 1/1 + 1/(x + 1)
    * x + 1 = x(x + 1) + x
    * x + 1 = x^2 + 2x
    * x^2 + x - 1 = 0
    * Using the quadratic formula, we get:

    * Since resistance cannot be negative, we take the positive solution:
        * x = (-1 + √5) / 2

7. **Total Resistance:** The total resistance between a and b is the resistance of the initial R resistor plus the resistance ""x"":
    * R + x = 1 + (-1 + √5) / 2
    * R + x = (2 + √5) / 2
    * R + x = 1 + √5 / 2
    * R + x ≈ 2

364,"As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of ⊙O, and points C and D are on ⊙O. If ∠ABD = 50.0, then the degree of ∠BCD is ()",40°,"The answer is 40.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Since AB is the diameter of the circle, ∠ACB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem).

2. ∠ABD and ∠ACD are both inscribed angles that intercept the same arc AD. Therefore, they are equal: ∠ACD = ∠ABD = 50°.

3. In triangle ACD, we have ∠ACD + ∠CAD + ∠CDA = 180°. Since ∠ACD = 50° and ∠CAD = 90°, we can solve for ∠CDA: ∠CDA = 180° - 50° - 90° = 40°.

4. Finally, ∠BCD is an exterior angle of triangle ACD, and it is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles: ∠BCD = ∠CDA + ∠CAD = 40° + 90° = 130°.

Therefore, the degree of ∠BCD is 130°.",False,0,2.8296561241149902,548.0
990,"In $\odot S$, $m \widehat {PQR}=98$, Find $m \widehat {PQ}$.",49,"The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, $m\angle PSQ = 98^\circ$.  Since $\angle PST$ is a right angle, $m\angle QST = 90^\circ - 98^\circ = -8^\circ$.  Since $\angle QST$ is a central angle, $m\widehat{QT} = -8^\circ$.  Since the measure of an arc cannot be negative, we add $360^\circ$ to get $m\widehat{QT} = 352^\circ$.  Finally, $m\widehat{PQ} = 360^\circ - 352^\circ = \boxed{8^\circ}$.

930,如图，F是△ABC的角平分线CD和BE的交点，CG⊥AB于点G．若∠ACG＝32°，则∠BFC的度数是（）,119°,"The answer is 116°.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Angle Properties:** Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know that ∠CGA = 90°.

2. **Angle Sum Property:** In triangle ACG, we have ∠ACG + ∠CGA + ∠GAC = 180°. Substituting the known values, we get 32° + 90° + ∠GAC = 180°, which gives us ∠GAC = 58°.

3. **Angle Bisector Property:** Since CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, we have ∠ACD = ∠BCD.

4. **Angle Sum Property:** In triangle ACD, we have ∠ACD + ∠CAD + ∠CDA = 180°. Substituting the known values, we get ∠ACD + 58° + ∠CDA = 180°, which gives us ∠ACD + ∠CDA = 122°.

5. **Angle Sum Property:** In triangle BCD, we have ∠BCD + ∠CDB + ∠CBD = 180°. Since ∠ACD = ∠BCD, we can substitute to get ∠ACD + ∠CDB + ∠CBD = 180°.

6. **Combining Equations:** Adding the equations from steps 4 and 5, we get 2∠ACD + ∠CDA + ∠CDB + ∠CBD = 302°.

7. **Angle Sum Property:** In triangle FCD, we have ∠FCD + ∠FDC + ∠CFD = 180°. Since ∠FCD = ∠ACD and ∠FDC = ∠CDA + ∠CDB, we can substitute to get ∠ACD + ∠CDA + ∠CDB + ∠CFD = 180°.

8. **Solving for ∠CFD:** Subtracting the equation from step 7 from the equation in step 6, we get ∠ACD + ∠CBD = 122°. Since ∠ACD = ∠BCD, we have 2∠BCD + ∠CBD = 122°.

9. **Angle Sum Property:** In triangle BCF, we have ∠BCF + ∠CBF + ∠BFC = 180°. Substituting the known values, we get ∠BCD + ∠CBD + ∠BFC = 180°.

10. **Solving for ∠BFC:** Substituting the value from step 8 into the equation from step 9, we get 122° + ∠BFC = 180°, which gives us ∠BFC = 58°.

Therefore, the measure of ∠BFC is 58°.",False,0,5.69780421257019,920.0
955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"The answer is 108 degrees. Here's why:

* **Regular Pentagon:** A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles.
* **Central Angle:**  The central angle of a regular pentagon (the angle formed by connecting two vertices to the center) is found by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides: 360/5 = 72 degrees.
* **Angle at a Vertex:**  Each angle of a regular pentagon is found by dividing the sum of the interior angles by the number of sides. The sum of interior angles in an n-sided polygon is (n-2) * 180 degrees. For a pentagon, this is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.  Therefore, each angle of the pentagon is 540/5 = 108 degrees.
* **Angle ADE:**  Angle ADE is one of the angles of the regular pentagon.

Therefore, ∠ADE = **108 degrees**.
