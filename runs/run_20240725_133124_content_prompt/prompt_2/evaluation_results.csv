As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()

**Solution:**

1. **Identify key relationships:**
   - Since CD is a diameter, ∠COD is a straight angle, meaning it measures 180 degrees.
   - Because DE ∥ OA, we know that ∠D and ∠A are alternate interior angles and therefore congruent. This means ∠A also measures 50 degrees.

2. **Apply angle properties:**
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle AOD, we have: ∠A + ∠D + ∠AOD = 180 degrees.
   - Substituting the known values: 50 degrees + 50 degrees + ∠AOD = 180 degrees.
   - Solving for ∠AOD: ∠AOD = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 50 degrees = 80 degrees.

3. **Find ∠C:**
   - ∠COD is a straight angle, so ∠AOD + ∠COD = 180 degrees.
   - Substituting the value of ∠AOD: 80 degrees + ∠COD = 180 degrees.
   - Solving for ∠COD: ∠COD = 180 degrees - 80 degrees = 100 degrees.
   - Finally, in triangle COD, we have: ∠C + ∠D + ∠COD = 180 degrees.
   - Substituting the known values: ∠C + 50 degrees + 100 degrees = 180 degrees.
   - Solving for ∠C: ∠C = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 100 degrees = 30 degrees.

**Answer:** The degree of ∠C is **30 degrees**.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"**Problem:** Find $h$ in the triangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We have the opposite side (4) and the hypotenuse (h) and need to find the adjacent side. The trigonometric ratio that relates these sides is the sine function: 
   sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse

2. **Substitute the values:** We know θ = 60° and the opposite side is 4, and the hypotenuse is h. So, we have:
   sin(60°) = 4 / h

3. **Solve for h:**
   * sin(60°) = √3 / 2 
   * (√3 / 2) = 4 / h
   * h = (4 * 2) / √3
   * h = 8 / √3

4. **Rationalize the denominator:**
   * h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
   * h = 8√3 / 3

**Therefore, h = 8√3 / 3**

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the problem:** We are given a circle with center O, and a point P outside the circle. Lines PA and PB intersect the circle at points C and D, respectively. We know the central angles of arcs AB and CD, and we need to find the measure of angle P.

2. **Key Concepts:**
    * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

3. **Applying the Concepts:**
    * **Angle ACB:** Since ∠AOB is a central angle intercepting arc AB, we have ∠AOB = 90°.  ∠ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc, so ∠ACB = 1/2 * ∠AOB = 45°.
    * **Angle ADB:** Similarly, ∠AOD is a central angle intercepting arc CD, so ∠AOD = 50°.  ∠ADB is an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc, so ∠ADB = 1/2 * ∠AOD = 25°.

    * Substituting the values we found into the equation for triangle PAB:
        ∠P + (45° + ∠CAB) + (25° + ∠DBA) = 180°
        ∠P + ∠CAB + ∠DBA = 110°
        ∠P + 180° = 110°

* In the figure, points A, B, and C are all on circle O with a radius of 2. Angle C is 30 degrees. What is the length of chord AB?

**Solution:**

1. **Draw a diagram:**  Draw a circle with center O and points A, B, and C on the circle. Draw lines connecting A, B, and C to form a triangle. Label angle C as 30 degrees.

2. **Identify key relationships:** Since angle C is 30 degrees and it's inscribed in the circle, the central angle subtended by arc AB is twice the measure of angle C, which is 60 degrees.

3. **Apply properties of equilateral triangles:**  A central angle of 60 degrees means that arc AB is 1/6 of the circumference of the circle. This also means that triangle AOB is an equilateral triangle because all its sides are radii of the circle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Rotation:**  Rotating △ABC 90 degrees clockwise around point A means that:
   * ∠BAC becomes ∠B′AC′ (both are right angles).
   * ∠ABC becomes ∠AB′C′.

* In the figure, points A and C are on the two sides BF and BD of ∠FBD, BE bisects ∠FBD, CE bisects ∠ACD, and AE is connected. If ∠BEC = 35°, what is the measure of ∠FAE?

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the problem:** We are given a diagram with angles and bisectors. We need to find the measure of ∠FAE.

2. **Using angle bisectors:** Since BE bisects ∠FBD, we know that ∠FBE = ∠EBD. Similarly, since CE bisects ∠ACD, we know that ∠ACE = ∠ECD.

3. **Finding angles in triangle BEC:**  We are given that ∠BEC = 35°.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, we can find ∠BCE and ∠CBE:
    * ∠BCE + ∠CBE + ∠BEC = 180°
    * ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 180° - 35° = 145°

4. **Relating angles to ∠FAE:**  Notice that ∠FAE is an exterior angle of triangle ABE.  The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore:
    * ∠FAE = ∠ABE + ∠BAE

5. **Expressing angles in terms of known angles:**
    * ∠ABE = ∠CBE (since BE bisects ∠FBD)
    * ∠BAE = ∠ACE (since CE bisects ∠ACD)

6. **Substituting and solving:**
    * ∠FAE = ∠CBE + ∠ACE
    * ∠FAE = (1/2)(∠BCE + ∠CBE) + (1/2)(∠ACD)
    * ∠FAE = (1/2)(145°) + (1/2)(∠ACD)
    * ∠FAE = 72.5° + (1/2)(∠ACD)

7. **Finding ∠ACD:**  Since ∠ACD is an exterior angle of triangle BCE, we have:
    * ∠ACD = ∠BEC + ∠CBE
    * ∠ACD = 35° + ∠CBE

8. **Substituting and solving for ∠FAE:**
    * ∠FAE = 72.5° + (1/2)(35° + ∠CBE)
    * ∠FAE = 72.5° + 17.5° + (1/2)(∠CBE)
    * ∠FAE = 90° + (1/2)(∠CBE)

9. **Final answer:** Since we don't have the exact value of ∠CBE, we cannot find the exact value of ∠FAE. However, we can express ∠FAE in terms of ∠CBE: ∠FAE = 90° + (1/2)(∠CBE).

* In triangle ABC, AD bisects angle BAC and intersects BC at point D. DE is perpendicular to AB, and the foot of the perpendicular is E. If DE = 3 and AC = 4, what is the area of triangle ADC?

**Solution:**

1. **Draw a diagram:**  The problem provides a diagram, but it's helpful to redraw it to make sure you understand the relationships between the points and lines.

2. **Identify key relationships:**
   * AD bisects angle BAC, meaning angle BAD = angle CAD.
   * DE is perpendicular to AB, forming a right angle at E.

3. **Use the given information:**
   * DE = 3
   * AC = 4

4. **Apply relevant geometric concepts:**
   * **Area of a triangle:**  The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.
   * **Similar triangles:**  Triangles ADE and ADC share angle A and both have a right angle, making them similar triangles. This means their corresponding sides are proportional.

5. **Solve for the height of triangle ADC:**
   * Since triangles ADE and ADC are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal.  Therefore, AD/AC = DE/DC.
   * We know DE = 3 and AC = 4.  Let DC = x.  Substituting these values into the proportion, we get AD/4 = 3/x.
   * Solving for AD, we get AD = 12/x.
   * The height of triangle ADC is AD, which we just found to be 12/x.

6. **Calculate the area of triangle ADC:**
   * Area of triangle ADC = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * AC * AD = (1/2) * 4 * (12/x) = 24/x.

7. **Find the value of x (DC):**
   * We can use the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle ADE:  AD² = DE² + AE².
   * We know DE = 3 and AD = 12/x.  Substituting these values, we get (12/x)² = 3² + AE².
   * Solving for AE, we get AE = √((12/x)² - 9).
   * In right triangle ADC, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again:  AC² = AD² + DC².
   * We know AC = 4, AD = 12/x, and DC = x.  Substituting these values, we get 4² = (12/x)² + x².
   * Simplifying the equation, we get 16 = 144/x² + x².
   * Multiplying both sides by x², we get 16x² = 144 + x⁴.
   * Rearranging the terms, we get x⁴ - 16x² + 144 = 0.
   * This is a quadratic equation in x².  We can solve it using the quadratic formula:  x² = (16 ± √(16² - 4 * 144)) / 2 = 8 ± 4√7.
   * Since x represents a length, it must be positive.  Therefore, x² = 8 + 4√7.
   * Taking the square root of both sides, we get x = √(8 + 4√7).

8. **Substitute the value of x to find the area:**
   * Area of triangle ADC = 24/x = 24 / √(8 + 4√7).

**Therefore, the area of triangle ADC is 24 / √(8 + 4√7).**

* As shown in the figure, the two chords AB and CD in the circle intersect at E, ∠D = 35.0, ∠AEC = 105.0, then ∠C = ()

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the relevant angles:** We are given ∠D = 35.0° and ∠AEC = 105.0°. We need to find ∠C.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Since ∠D intercepts the same arc as ∠C, we have:
   ∠C = 2 * ∠D = 2 * 35.0° = 70.0°

3. **Apply the Angle Addition Postulate:**  ∠AEC is an exterior angle of triangle ACE.  The Angle Addition Postulate states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.  Therefore:
   ∠AEC = ∠C + ∠CAE
   105.0° = 70.0° + ∠CAE
   ∠CAE = 105.0° - 70.0° = 35.0°

4. **Apply the Triangle Angle Sum Theorem:** The Triangle Angle Sum Theorem states that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180°.  Therefore:
   ∠C + ∠CAE + ∠CEA = 180°
   70.0° + 35.0° + ∠CEA = 180°
   ∠CEA = 180° - 70.0° - 35.0° = 75.0°

2. **Apply the theorem:**  Let's label the segments of the chords as follows:
    * Segment 1:  x
    * Segment 2: 9
    * Segment 3: 2x
    * Segment 4: y

    According to the Intersecting Chords Theorem:
    x * 9 = 2x * y

3. **Solve for y:** We need to find the value of y before we can solve for x.  Notice that the diameter of the circle is 24, so the radius is 12.  The line segment with length 12.25 is a radius of the circle, and it forms a right triangle with the segments of length y and 12.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find y:

    y² + 12² = 12.25²
    y² = 12.25² - 12²
    y² = 5.5625
    y = √5.5625 = 2.36

4. **Substitute and solve for x:** Now we can substitute the value of y back into the equation from step 2:

7. **Finding ∠E:** Since ∠GDC = 0°, we have ∠EDC = ∠GDC + ∠GDE = 0° + ∠GDE = ∠GDE.  Since △ABC≌△DEF, we know ∠E = ∠B.  Therefore, ∠E = ∠B = ∠GDE.

8. **Final Answer:**  Assuming the correction in the problem statement, ∠E = ∠GDE = 0°.

**Note:** The problem statement or the figure likely contains an error. It is impossible for ∠CGF to be 88° and for ∠GDC to be a valid angle in the given context.

* In the figure, AB is the diameter of circle O, points C and D are on circle O, ∠BCD = 25°, what is the measure of ∠AOD?

**Solution:**

* As shown in the figure, ∠BAC = 110.0, if A and B are symmetrical with respect to the line MP, A and C are symmetrical with respect to the line NQ, then the size of ∠PAQ is ()

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding Symmetry:**  Symmetry means that the points are mirrored across a line.  
    * Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, this means line MP is the perpendicular bisector of line AB.
    * Similarly, line NQ is the perpendicular bisector of line AC.

2. **Angles and Symmetry:**
    * Because MP is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know ∠AMP = ∠BMP = 90°.
    * Similarly, ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ = 90°.

3. **Finding ∠PAQ:**
    * We know ∠BAC = 110°.
    * Since ∠AMP = ∠BMP = 90°, we can find ∠MAP = 180° - 90° - 110° = -20°.  However, angles cannot be negative, so we need to consider the other side of the line MP.  Therefore, ∠MAP = 180° - 20° = 160°.
    * Similarly, ∠NAQ = 160°.

**Solution:**

1. **Divide the triangle into smaller shapes:** We can divide the triangle into an infinite number of horizontal strips, each of which is a rectangle.

2. **Find the center of mass of each strip:** The center of mass of each rectangular strip is located at its midpoint, which is at a distance of y/2 from the base of the triangle.

3. **Integrate to find the overall center of mass:** To find the overall center of mass, we need to integrate the y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip, weighted by the mass of each strip.

4. **Set up the integral:** The mass of each strip is proportional to its area, which is equal to the width of the strip (dx) times its height (y). The y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip is y/2. Therefore, the integral for the y-coordinate of the center of mass is:

```
y_cm = (1/M) * ∫(y/2) * (ρ * dx * y) dy
```

where:

* M is the total mass of the triangle
* ρ is the areal density of the triangle
* y is the height of the triangle
* dx is the width of each strip
* dy is the infinitesimal change in height

5. **Simplify the integral:** We can simplify the integral by noting that the width of each strip is equal to the base of the triangle minus twice the distance from the y-axis to the edge of the strip. This gives us:

```
dx = 2a - 2x
```

Substituting this into the integral, we get:

```
y_cm = (1/M) * ∫(y/2) * (ρ * (2a - 2x) * y) dy
```

6. **Evaluate the integral:** Evaluating the integral, we get:

```
y_cm = (1/M) * (ρ * a * y^3 / 3 - ρ * y^4 / 6) |_0^a
```

7. **Solve for y_cm:** Plugging in the limits of integration and simplifying, we get:

```
y_cm = (1/M) * (ρ * a^4 / 3 - ρ * a^4 / 6)
```

```
y_cm = (1/M) * (ρ * a^4 / 6)
```

8. **Find the total mass:** The total mass of the triangle is equal to its area times its areal density:

```
M = (1/2) * a * a * ρ = (1/2) * ρ * a^2
```

9. **Substitute and simplify:** Substituting the value of M into the equation for y_cm, we get:

```
y_cm = (1/((1/2) * ρ * a^2)) * (ρ * a^4 / 6)
```

```
y_cm = (2 * a^2 / 6)
```

```
y_cm = a^2 / 3

2. **Simplify the parallel resistors:** The three resistors in parallel have an equivalent resistance of R/3.

3. **Combine the equivalent resistance with the series resistor:** The equivalent resistance of the repeating pattern is R/3 + R = 4R/3.

2. **Apply the theorem:** In this case, the tangent segment is 8, the secant segment is 12 + 15 = 27, and the external segment is 15.  Therefore, we can write the equation:

   8² = 15 * 27

3. **Solve for x:**

   * 64 = 405
   * x² = 405 - 64
   * x² = 341
   * x = √341 ≈ 18.5

**Answer:** x ≈ 18.5

* As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of ⊙O, and points C and D are on ⊙O. If ∠ABD = 50.0, then the degree of ∠BCD is ()

**Solution:**

1. **Identify key relationships:** Since AB is the diameter of the circle, we know that ∠ACB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem).

2. **Apply angle properties:**  We are given that ∠ABD = 50°.  Since ∠ABD and ∠ACD are both inscribed angles intercepting the same arc AD, they are equal. Therefore, ∠ACD = 50°.

3. **Solve for the missing angle:** In triangle ACD, we have ∠ACD = 50° and ∠CAD = 90°.  The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so ∠CDA = 180° - 50° - 90° = 40°.

4. **Find the desired angle:**  ∠BCD is an exterior angle of triangle ACD.  The measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, ∠BCD = ∠CDA + ∠ACD = 40° + 50° = 90°.

**Answer:** ∠BCD = 90°

* In $\odot S$, $m \widehat {PQR}=98$, Find $m \widehat {PQ}$.

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a circle with center S, and we know the measure of the major arc PQR is 98 degrees. We need to find the measure of the minor arc PQ.

2. **Key Concept:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

3. **Applying the Concept:**  Since line segment QS is a radius of the circle, angle QSP is a central angle.  The intercepted arc of angle QSP is arc PQR. Therefore,  $m \angle QSP = m \widehat {PQR} = 98^\circ$.

4. **Finding the Measure of Arc PQ:**  A circle has 360 degrees.  Since arc PQR and arc PQ make up the entire circle, we can find the measure of arc PQ by subtracting the measure of arc PQR from 360 degrees:

   $m \widehat {PQ} = 360^\circ - m \widehat {PQR} = 360^\circ - 98^\circ = 262^\circ$

**Answer:** $m \widehat {PQ} = 262^\circ$

930,如图，F是△ABC的角平分线CD和BE的交点，CG⊥AB于点G．若∠ACG＝32°，则∠BFC的度数是（）,119°,"**Problem:** 
* In the figure, F is the intersection of the angle bisector CD and BE of △ABC, CG⊥AB at point G. If ∠ACG=32°, what is the measure of ∠BFC?

**Solution:**

1. **Identify key angles:** We are given that ∠ACG = 32°. Since CG⊥AB, we know that ∠CGA = 90°.

2. **Apply angle sum property:** In triangle ACG, we have:
   ∠ACG + ∠CGA + ∠GAC = 180°
   32° + 90° + ∠GAC = 180°
   ∠GAC = 180° - 32° - 90° = 58°

3. **Angle bisector property:** Since CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, we have:
   ∠ACD = ∠BCD = (1/2)∠ACB

4. **Apply angle sum property again:** In triangle ACF, we have:
   ∠CAF + ∠ACF + ∠CFA = 180°
   58° + ∠ACD + ∠CFA = 180°
   ∠CFA = 180° - 58° - ∠ACD

5. **Similarly, in triangle BCF:**
   ∠CBF + ∠BCF + ∠CFB = 180°
   ∠CBF + ∠BCD + ∠CFB = 180°
   ∠CFB = 180° - ∠CBF - ∠BCD

6. **Combine the results:** Notice that ∠CFA and ∠CFB are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°). Therefore:
   ∠CFA + ∠CFB = 180°
   (180° - 58° - ∠ACD) + (180° - ∠CBF - ∠BCD) = 180°
   360° - 58° - ∠ACD - ∠CBF - ∠BCD = 180°
   ∠ACD + ∠BCD + ∠CBF = 360° - 180° - 58° = 122°

7. **Substitute angle bisector property:**
   (1/2)∠ACB + (1/2)∠ACB + ∠CBF = 122°
   ∠ACB + ∠CBF = 122°

8. **Apply angle sum property in triangle ABC:**
   ∠CAB + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°
   ∠CAB + ∠ABC + (122° - ∠CBF) = 180°
   ∠CAB + ∠ABC - ∠CBF = 58°

9. **Finally, in triangle BFC:**
   ∠BFC = 180° - ∠CBF - ∠BCF
   ∠BFC = 180° - ∠CBF - (1/2)∠ACB
   ∠BFC = 180° - ∠CBF - (1/2)(122° - ∠CBF)
   ∠BFC = 180° - ∠CBF - 61° + (1/2)∠CBF
   ∠BFC = 119° - (1/2)∠CBF

**Therefore, the measure of ∠BFC is 119° - (1/2)∠CBF.**  We cannot determine the exact value of ∠BFC without knowing the measure of ∠CBF.

955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"**Problem:** 
*  Point O is the center of regular pentagon ABCDE, circle O is the circumcircle of the pentagon, what is the measure of angle ADE?

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Properties of Regular Polygons:** A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 540 degrees, so each angle in a regular pentagon measures 108 degrees (540/5 = 108).

2. **Central Angle:**  Angle AOB is a central angle of the pentagon, and it intercepts arc AB. Since the pentagon is regular, arc AB is 1/5 of the entire circumference of the circle. Therefore, the measure of central angle AOB is 1/5 of 360 degrees, which is 72 degrees.

3. **Inscribed Angle:** Angle ADE is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc AB as central angle AOB. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, angle ADE measures half of 72 degrees, which is **36 degrees**.

**Answer:** ∠ADE = 36°
