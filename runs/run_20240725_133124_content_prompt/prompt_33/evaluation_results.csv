Since AD is the median of triangle ABC, we know that BD = DC.  Also, since E is the midpoint of AD, we know that AE = ED.

Therefore, triangles ABE and ADE share the same base AE and the same height (the perpendicular distance from D to AE).  This means that the area of triangle ABE is equal to the area of triangle ADE.

Similarly, triangles ADE and CDE share the same base DE and the same height (the perpendicular distance from A to DE).  This means that the area of triangle ADE is equal to the area of triangle CDE.

Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles ABE, ADE, and CDE, which is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that a bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.  In this case, we have:

$$\frac{JQ}{QN} = \frac{JL}{LN}$$

We know that $JL = 16.5$ and $LN = 9 + 16.5 = 25.5$.  We also know that $QN = QK$ because $\overline{KQ}$ bisects $\angle K$.  Therefore, we can write:

$$\frac{JQ}{QK} = \frac{16.5}{25.5}$$

Since $JQ + QK = JK$, we can solve for $JQ$ by substituting $JK - JQ$ for $QK$:

$$\frac{JQ}{JK - JQ} = \frac{16.5}{25.5}$$

Cross-multiplying gives us:

$$25.5JQ = 16.5JK - 16.5JQ$$

Combining like terms, we get:

$$42JQ = 16.5JK$$

Solving for $JQ$, we get:

$$JQ = \frac{16.5JK}{42}$$

We don't know the length of $JK$, but we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find it.  We know that $KQ = QM = 9$ and $KM = 16.5 - 9 = 7.5$.  Therefore, we have:

$$JK^2 = KQ^2 + QM^2 = 9^2 + 9^2 = 162$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

$$JK = \sqrt{162} = 9\sqrt{2}$$

Substituting this value into our equation for $JQ$, we get:

$$JQ = \frac{16.5 \cdot 9\sqrt{2}}{42} = \frac{148.5\sqrt{2}}{42} \approx \boxed{4.98}$$",False,0,6.7906458377838135,1053.0

In right triangle AMB, we have:

4 + (8 + AC)²/4 = BM²

**5. Solve for AC:**

Now we have two expressions for BM².  Set them equal to each other:

240 - 4AM² = (8 + AC)²
240 - 4AM² = 64 + 16AC + AC²
AC² + 16AC - 176 + 4AM² = 0

Since we don't know AM, we can't solve for AC directly. However, we can use the fact that AB/AC = BM/CM to eliminate AM.  From the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:

8/AC = BM/CM

Since BM² = 64 - AM² and CM² = AC² - AM², we can write:

8/AC = √(64 - AM²)/√(AC² - AM²)

Squaring both sides:

64/AC² = (64 - AM²)/(AC² - AM²)

Cross-multiplying and simplifying:

64(AC² - AM²) = AC²(64 - AM²)
64AC² - 64AM² = 64AC² - AC²AM²
AC²AM² - 64AM² = 0

We are given a right triangle ABC with a right angle at A. Three equilateral triangles are constructed outwards on the sides of this triangle:

*  △AB'C on side AC
*  △ABC' on side AB

We know the areas of △A'BC and △AB'C are 10 and 4, respectively. We need to find the area of △ABC'.

* **Area of an equilateral triangle:** The area of an equilateral triangle with side 's' is given by (√3/4) * s².
* **Pythagorean Theorem:** In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

**Solution**

1. **Find the sides of the equilateral triangles:**
   *  Let the side of △A'BC be 'a'.  Its area is 10, so (√3/4) * a² = 10. Solving for 'a', we get a = √(40/√3).
   *  Let the side of △AB'C be 'b'. Its area is 4, so (√3/4) * b² = 4. Solving for 'b', we get b = √(16/√3).

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   *  In right triangle ABC, AC = b and BC = a. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, AB² = AC² + BC².
   *  Substituting the values of 'a' and 'b', we get AB² = (16/√3) + (40/√3) = 56/√3.

Since A, B, and C are points on circle O, we know that ∠ACB is an inscribed angle.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, the measure of arc AB is 2 * ∠ACB = 2 * 25° = 50°.

∠BAO is a central angle that intercepts arc AB.  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, ∠BAO = 50°.

However, the problem asks for the degree of ∠BAO, not the measure of arc AB.  Since ∠BAO is a central angle, it is also a radius of the circle.  Therefore, ∠BAO is a right angle, which measures 90°.

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a quadrilateral ABCD with specific angle measures. We need to find a point M on BC and a point N on CD such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized.  Then, we need to find the sum of angles AMN and ANM.

**Solution**

1. **Symmetry:**  Notice that the problem has symmetry.  Since ∠B = ∠D = 90°, and ∠BAD = 120°, we can reflect the figure across line AD. This creates a symmetrical figure where the corresponding points M and N are reflections of each other.

2. **Minimizing Perimeter:**  The perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized when AM + MN + AN is minimized.  Due to the symmetry, this occurs when AM + AN is minimized.

3. **Shortest Path:**  The shortest path between two points is a straight line. Therefore, to minimize AM + AN, we need to find the point M on BC and N on CD such that AMN is a straight line.

228,"As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of circle O, DB and DC are respectively tangent to circle O at points B and C. If ∠ACE = 25.0, then the degree of ∠D is ()",50°,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand the Properties**

* **Tangent-Radius Property:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  Therefore, ∠OBC = ∠OCD = 90°.
* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Angles on a Straight Line:** The angles on a straight line add up to 180°.

**2. Apply the Properties**

* Since ∠OBC = 90°, we know ∠ABO = 90° - ∠OBA.
* Since AB is a diameter, ∠ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting a semicircle, making ∠ACB = 90°.
* Therefore, ∠ABO = ∠ACE = 25° (angles on a straight line).
* Now, ∠BOC = 180° - ∠OBC - ∠ABO = 180° - 90° - 25° = 65°.
* Finally, ∠D = 180° - ∠BOC - ∠OCD = 180° - 65° - 90° = **25°**.

**Therefore, the degree of ∠D is 25°.**

737,Find the perimeter of the parallelogram.,78,"The perimeter of a parallelogram is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.  Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, we can find the perimeter by adding the lengths of two adjacent sides and multiplying by 2.

The length of one side is 23 ft.  To find the length of the other side, we can use trigonometry.  The angle between the 23 ft side and the unknown side is 60 degrees.  The unknown side is the opposite side to the 60 degree angle, and the 23 ft side is the adjacent side.  Therefore, we can use the tangent function:

tan(60°) = opposite/adjacent = unknown side/23 ft

Solving for the unknown side, we get:

unknown side = tan(60°) * 23 ft = 39.8 ft (approximately)

Now we can find the perimeter:

Perimeter = 2 * (23 ft + 39.8 ft) = 2 * 62.8 ft = 125.6 ft

733,Square ABCD. CT: tangent to semicircle. Find the angle ∠CTD. Return the numeric value.,63.4,"∠CTD = 45°

Here's why:

* **Angle Properties:**  Since ABCD is a square, all angles are right angles (90°).
* **Tangent-Radius Property:**  A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. Therefore, ∠CTB = 90°.
* **Angle Sum:**  The angles in triangle CTB add up to 180°.  We know ∠CTB = 90° and ∠CBT = 45° (half of the right angle in the square).  Therefore, ∠BTC = 180° - 90° - 45° = 45°.
* **Vertical Angles:**  ∠CTD and ∠BTC are vertical angles, meaning they are equal.  Therefore, ∠CTD = 45°.

**3. Find ∠BFC:**

* In triangle BFC, we know ∠BCF = 58° (from step 2).

1. **Regular Pentagon Properties:** A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. 

2. **Central Angle:** The central angle of a regular pentagon (the angle formed by connecting two vertices to the center) is found by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides: 360 degrees / 5 sides = 72 degrees.  Therefore, ∠AOE = 72 degrees.

3. **Isosceles Triangle:** Triangle AOE is isosceles because OA = OE (radii of the circle).  This means ∠OAE = ∠OEA.

4. **Angle Sum:** The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  So, in triangle AOE: ∠AOE + ∠OAE + ∠OEA = 180 degrees.
