A student has presented you with an image containing a math problem and needs your help to solve it. 

1. Problem: 
    * What is the specific mathematical question we need to answer based on the image?

2. Solution Steps:
    * Break down the solution process into a series of numbered steps.
    * For each step:
        * Clearly describe the mathematical operation being performed.
        * Explain why this specific operation is necessary at this step. Imagine you are explaining it to someone who has never seen this type of problem before.
        * If a formula is used:
            * State the formula clearly.
            * Explain what each part of the formula represents and why it is relevant to this specific step.
            * Show how to plug in the values from the problem into the formula.
            * Calculate the result and clearly state the answer for this step.

3. Solution Verification: 
    * What is the final answer to the problem, simplified as much as possible?
    * How can we be absolutely sure our answer is correct? Explain your reasoning.
