643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem Breakdown:

The image shows a circle with center O, diameter CD, and chords DE and OA. We are given that DE is parallel to OA and ∠D measures 50 degrees. The question asks us to find the measure of ∠C.

## Solution Journey:

1. **Identify Key Relationships:**
   * **Parallel Lines:** Since DE || OA, we know that ∠D and ∠A are corresponding angles and therefore congruent. This means ∠A also measures 50 degrees.
   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  ∠C is an inscribed angle that intercepts the diameter CD. The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   * Since CD is the diameter, the intercepted arc is a semicircle, which measures 180 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠C = (1/2) * 180° = 90°.

## Reaching the Answer:

The degree of ∠C is **90 degrees**.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## 1. Problem Breakdown:

The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees and the side opposite that angle having a length of 4. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse, represented by 'h'.

## 2. Solution Journey:

**Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio.**

We know the opposite side (4) and we want to find the hypotenuse (h). The trigonometric ratio that relates opposite and hypotenuse is **sine**.

**Step 2: Write down the sine formula.**

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse.  This can be written as:

```
sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse
```

**Step 3: Substitute the known values.**

In this case, we have:

```
sin(60°) = 4 / h
```

**Step 4: Solve for h.**

To isolate 'h', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 'h' and then divide both sides by sin(60°):

```
h * sin(60°) = 4
h = 4 / sin(60°)
```

**Step 5: Calculate the value of sin(60°).**

The sine of 60 degrees is √3 / 2.

**Step 6: Substitute the value of sin(60°) and simplify.**

```
h = 4 / (√3 / 2)
h = 4 * (2 / √3)
h = 8 / √3
```

**Step 7: Rationalize the denominator.**

To get rid of the radical in the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by √3:

```
h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
h = 8√3 / 3
```

## 3. Reaching the Answer:

The final simplified answer for the length of the hypotenuse 'h' is **8√3 / 3**.

The image shows two concentric circles (circles with the same center). We are given that the radius of the larger circle is 4, and we need to find the radius of the smaller circle.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between the circles.**
    * The circles are concentric, meaning they share the same center point (Q). This is important because it tells us that the distance from the center of the smaller circle to the edge of the larger circle is equal to the radius of the larger circle.

* **Step 2: Visualize the radius of the smaller circle.**
    * Imagine drawing a line segment from the center of the smaller circle (Q) to a point on its circumference. This line segment represents the radius of the smaller circle.

* **Step 3: Apply the given information.**
    * We know the radius of the larger circle is 4. This means the distance from point Q to point R (on the edge of the larger circle) is 4.

* **Step 4:  Deduce the radius of the smaller circle.**
    * Since point Q is also the center of the smaller circle, the distance from Q to R is also the sum of the radius of the smaller circle and the distance from Q to the edge of the smaller circle. 
    * Therefore, the radius of the smaller circle is half the radius of the larger circle.

**1. Problem Breakdown:**

The image shows two intersecting lines, AB and CD, forming four angles.  A ray OE is drawn bisecting angle BOC.  We are given that angle AOD is 70 degrees and need to find the measure of angle AOE.

**2. Solution Journey:**

**Step 1: Identify Relevant Angles**

* We know ∠AOD = 70°.
* Since ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), we can find ∠BOD:
    * ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°

**Step 2: Understand Angle Bisector**

* Ray OE bisects ∠BOC, meaning it divides ∠BOC into two equal angles: ∠BOE and ∠COE.

**Step 3: Apply Angle Relationships**

* ∠BOD and ∠BOC are adjacent angles (they share a common side and vertex).  Therefore:
    * ∠BOC = ∠BOD + ∠COE 
* Since OE bisects ∠BOC, we know:
    * ∠BOE = ∠COE

**Step 4: Solve for ∠AOE**

* ∠AOE is the sum of ∠AOD and ∠DOE:
    * ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠DOE
* We can express ∠DOE as:
    * ∠DOE = ∠BOE - ∠BOD

**Step 5: Substitute and Calculate**

* Substitute the known values and solve for ∠AOE:
    * ∠AOE = ∠AOD + (∠BOE - ∠BOD)
    * ∠AOE = 70° + (∠BOE - 110°)
    * ∠AOE = ∠BOE - 40°

**Step 6: Find ∠BOE**

* Since ∠BOE and ∠COE are equal and together form ∠BOC, we can find ∠BOE:
    * ∠BOE = ∠BOC / 2
    * ∠BOE = (∠BOD + ∠COE) / 2
    * ∠BOE = (110° + ∠COE) / 2

**Step 7: Substitute and Solve**

* Substitute the value of ∠BOE back into the equation for ∠AOE:
    * ∠AOE = (110° + ∠COE) / 2 - 40°
    * ∠AOE = 55° + ∠COE / 2 - 40°
    * ∠AOE = 15° + ∠COE / 2

**Step 8: Final Calculation**

* Since ∠COE is half of ∠BOC, and we know ∠BOC = ∠BOD + ∠COE, we can find ∠COE:
    * ∠COE = (∠BOD + ∠COE) / 2
    * ∠COE = 110° / 2 = 55°
* Substitute the value of ∠COE back into the equation for ∠AOE:
    * ∠AOE = 15° + 55° / 2
    * ∠AOE = 15° + 27.5°
    * ∠AOE = 42.5°

The image shows a square with four charged particles at its corners. We need to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force acting on particle 3.

## Solution Journey:

**Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**

* Particle 1 exerts a force on particle 3, let's call it F13.
* Particle 2 exerts a force on particle 3, let's call it F23.
* Particle 4 exerts a force on particle 3, let's call it F43.

**Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of each force using Coulomb's Law.**

Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

* **Formula:** F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
    * F: Force between the charges
    * k: Coulomb's constant (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
    * q1, q2: Magnitudes of the charges
    * r: Distance between the charges

* **F13:**
    * q1 = 100 nC = 100 * 10^-9 C
    * q3 = 200 nC = 200 * 10^-9 C
    * r = a = 5 cm = 0.05 m
    * F13 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (100 * 10^-9 C) * (200 * 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m)^2 = 0.719 N

* **F23:**
    * q2 = 100 nC = 100 * 10^-9 C
    * q3 = 200 nC = 200 * 10^-9 C
    * r = √(a^2 + a^2) = a√2 = 0.05√2 m
    * F23 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (100 * 10^-9 C) * (200 * 10^-9 C) / (0.05√2 m)^2 = 0.3595 N

* **F43:**
    * q4 = 200 nC = 200 * 10^-9 C
    * q3 = 200 nC = 200 * 10^-9 C
    * r = a = 5 cm = 0.05 m
    * F43 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (200 * 10^-9 C) * (200 * 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m)^2 = 1.438 N

**Step 3: Determine the direction of each force.**

* **F13:** Attractive force (opposite charges) acting along the y-axis, so no x-component.
* **F23:** Attractive force (opposite charges) acting diagonally, with an x-component.
* **F43:** Repulsive force (same charges) acting along the x-axis.

**Step 4: Calculate the x-component of each force.**

* **F13:** No x-component.
* **F23:** The x-component of F23 is F23 * cos(45°) = 0.3595 N * cos(45°) = 0.254 N
* **F43:** The x-component of F43 is F43 = 1.438 N

**Step 5: Add the x-components of all forces to find the net x-component.**

* Net x-component = F13x + F23x + F43x = 0 + 0.254 N + 1.438 N = 1.692 N

The image shows a right triangle ABC within a 4x4 grid. Each square in the grid has a side length of 1.  We are asked to find the length of AD, which is the altitude drawn from vertex A to the hypotenuse BC.

## Solution Journey:

**Step 1: Identify the Key Triangles**

* We have a right triangle ABC, and we need to find the length of AD. 
* Notice that AD divides triangle ABC into two smaller right triangles: ABD and ACD.

**Step 2: Determine the Base and Height of the Triangles**

* **Triangle ABC:**
    * Base (BC):  Count the grid squares along the line BC.  BC = 5 units.
    * Height (AD): This is what we need to find.

## Solution Journey:

1. **Understanding Tangent Properties:**
   * **Key Property:**  A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°.
   * **Equal Tangent Lengths:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, AC = AD and BC = BD.

2. **Analyzing Triangle Properties:**
   * **Perimeter:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter of △PCD is PC + CD + PD.
   * **Combining Tangent Properties:**  We can rewrite the perimeter as (PA - AC) + CD + (PB - BD).  Since AC = AD and BC = BD, we can simplify this to (PA - AD) + CD + (PB - BD) = PA + PB + CD - (AD + BD).

3. **Finding the Missing Lengths:**
   * **PA + PB:**  Since PA and PB are tangents from the same point, they are equal. Therefore, PA + PB = 8.0 + 8.0 = 16.0.
   * **AD + BD:**  Since AD = AC and BD = BC, we can rewrite this as AC + BC.  Notice that AC + BC = AB, which is the diameter of the circle.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   * **Perimeter of △PCD:**  We now have all the necessary components to calculate the perimeter: 16.0 + CD - AB.  Since CD is a tangent to the circle, its length is equal to the diameter of the circle (AB).  Therefore, the perimeter of △PCD is 16.0 + CD - AB = 16.0 + AB - AB = **16.0**.

## Solution Journey:

**Step 1: Understanding Medians and Area Ratios**

* **Reasoning:** A median of a triangle divides the triangle into two triangles with equal areas. This is because the median divides the base of the triangle into two equal parts, and the height of both triangles is the same.
* **Formula:**  Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height

* **Formula:** Area(ABD) = Area(ACD)

**Step 3: Relating Areas of Triangles ABE and ABD**

* **Reasoning:**  Since E is the midpoint of AD, line segment AE is half the length of AD.  Both triangles ABE and ABD share the same base AB, but the height of triangle ABE is half the height of triangle ABD.
* **Formula:** Area(ABE) = (1/2) * Area(ABD)

**Step 4: Calculating the Area of Triangle ABD**

* **Reasoning:** We know Area(ABE) = 2. Using the relationship from Step 3, we can find the area of triangle ABD.
* **Calculation:** Area(ABD) = 2 * Area(ABE) = 2 * 2 = 4

776,Find $JQ$ if $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$.  Rounded to the nearest hundredth.,18.79,"**1. Problem Breakdown:**

The image shows a triangle JLN with an inscribed circle.  The point Q is the incenter of the triangle, and we are asked to find the length of line segment JQ.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Understanding the Incenter:** The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  It is also the center of the inscribed circle, which means it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.

* **Using the Incenter Property:** Since Q is the incenter, we know that JQ is the radius of the inscribed circle.  To find the radius, we can use the formula:

   * **Radius of Inscribed Circle (r):**  r = (Area of Triangle) / (Semiperimeter of Triangle)

* **Finding the Area of Triangle JLN:**  We can use the formula for the area of a triangle:

   * **Area of Triangle:**  Area = (1/2) * base * height

   * We can use JL as the base and the perpendicular distance from N to JL as the height.  We need to find this height.

* **Finding the Height:**  Notice that triangle NLM is a right triangle with NM = 9.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of NL:

   * **Pythagorean Theorem:**  a² + b² = c²

   * In this case, a = NM = 9, and c = NL.  We need to find b, which is the height of triangle JLN.

* **Finding the Semiperimeter:**  The semiperimeter of a triangle is half the perimeter.  We can calculate it as:

   * **Semiperimeter (s):**  s = (JL + LN + NJ) / 2

* **Putting it All Together:**  Once we have the area of triangle JLN and the semiperimeter, we can plug them into the formula for the radius of the inscribed circle to find JQ.

**3. Reaching the Answer:**

1. **Finding NL:**
   * Using the Pythagorean theorem: 9² + b² = NL²
   * We need more information to solve for NL.  Let's assume NL = 15 (this is just an example, the actual value might be different).

2. **Finding the Height of Triangle JLN:**
   * We assumed NL = 15.  Now we can find the height (b) using the Pythagorean theorem: 9² + b² = 15²
   * Solving for b: b² = 15² - 9² = 144
   * Therefore, b = √144 = 12

3. **Finding the Area of Triangle JLN:**
   * Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 16.5 * 12 = 99

4. **Finding the Semiperimeter:**
   * s = (JL + LN + NJ) / 2 = (16.5 + 15 + NJ) / 2
   * We need more information to find NJ.  Let's assume NJ = 10 (this is just an example, the actual value might be different).
   * s = (16.5 + 15 + 10) / 2 = 20.75

5. **Finding JQ (the radius):**
   * r = (Area of Triangle) / (Semiperimeter of Triangle) = 99 / 20.75 ≈ 4.77

**Therefore, JQ is approximately 4.77 units long.**

**Important Note:**  This solution is based on assumed values for NL and NJ.  To get the accurate answer, you need to find the actual lengths of NL and NJ using the information provided in the image or additional context.

**1. Problem Breakdown:**

The image shows a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of side AB. This bisector intersects AB at point D and BC at point E.  We are also given that AE is connected.  The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle ABC, given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13.

**2. Solution Journey:**

**Step 1: Understanding the Perpendicular Bisector**

* **Reasoning:** A perpendicular bisector of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts and forms a right angle with the segment.
* **Applying it:** Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

**Step 2: Using the Perimeter Information**

* **Reasoning:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides.
* **Applying it:** We know the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, so AC + CE + AE = 13.

**Step 3: Finding AC**

* **Reasoning:**  Since AD is a perpendicular bisector, we know that AD = DB and angle ADB is a right angle. Therefore, triangle ADB is a right-angled triangle.
* **Applying it:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AC:  AC² = AD² + DC² = 3² + DC² = 9 + DC².

**Step 4: Finding CE**

* **Reasoning:** We know that CE = BC - BE.
* **Applying it:** Since DE is a perpendicular bisector, we know that BE = AE. Therefore, CE = BC - AE.

**Step 5: Solving for BC**

* **Reasoning:** We can now substitute the values we found for AC and CE into the perimeter equation of triangle ACE.
* **Applying it:** 
    * AC + CE + AE = 13
    * (9 + DC²) + (BC - AE) + AE = 13
    * 9 + DC² + BC = 13
    * BC = 4 - DC²

**Step 6: Finding the Perimeter of Triangle ABC**

* **Reasoning:** The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC.
* **Applying it:** 
    * Perimeter of ABC = AB + BC + AC
    * Perimeter of ABC = 6 + (4 - DC²) + (9 + DC²)
    * Perimeter of ABC = 19

## Solution Journey:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**
   * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.  Therefore, ∠ABE = ∠EBC and ∠BCF = ∠FCD.

2. **Identifying Similar Triangles:**
   * Since AB || CD (opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel), we have ∠ABE = ∠CDE (alternate interior angles).
   * Similarly, ∠EBC = ∠FDC.
   * Therefore, ΔABE ~ ΔCDE (Angle-Angle Similarity).

3. **Using Proportions:**
   * Corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional.  Therefore, we have:
      * AE/DE = AB/CD
   * Since AB = CD (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal), we get:
      * AE/DE = 1

4. **Finding AE and DE:**
   * Since AE/DE = 1, we have AE = DE.
   * Since AD = 4, we have AE = DE = 2.

5. **Repeating Steps for ΔBCF and ΔDFC:**
   * Following the same logic as above, we can prove that ΔBCF ~ ΔDFC.
   * This leads to BF/DF = BC/CD = 1 (since BC = CD).
   * Therefore, BF = DF = 2.

6. **Calculating EF:**

2. **Identifying Vertical Angles:**  ∠BOC and ∠AOD are vertical angles. Vertical angles are always equal. Therefore, ∠AOD = ∠BOC = 50°.

3. **Using Angle Sum Property:**  The angles around a point add up to 360°.  Therefore, ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB + ∠BOC = 360°.

4. **Substituting Values:**  We know ∠AOD = ∠DOE = 50° and ∠BOC = 50°. Substituting these values into the equation from step 3, we get: 50° + 50° + ∠EOB + 50° = 360°.

5. **Solving for ∠EOB:**  Simplifying the equation, we get: 150° + ∠EOB = 360°.  Subtracting 150° from both sides, we get ∠EOB = 210°.

**1. Problem Breakdown:**

The image shows a trapezoid ABCD with known side lengths AB, AD, and BC. We need to find the length of side CD.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Step 1: Identify the Right Triangle**
   * Notice that the trapezoid has two right angles at A and B. This means we can form a right triangle by drawing a perpendicular line from C to AD, intersecting AD at point E.  Let's call this new line CE.

* **Step 2:  Find the Length of AE**
   * We know AB = 24 and BC = 16. Since AB is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABE, and BC is one of the legs, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AE:
      *  AB² = AE² + BC²
      *  24² = AE² + 16²
      *  576 = AE² + 256
      *  AE² = 320
      *  AE = √320 = 8√5

* **Step 3: Find the Length of ED**
   * We know AD = 23 and AE = 8√5.  Therefore:
      * ED = AD - AE
      * ED = 23 - 8√5

* **Step 4:  Find the Length of CD**
   * Now we have a right triangle CED, where CE = BC = 16 and ED = 23 - 8√5. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find CD:
      * CD² = CE² + ED²
      * CD² = 16² + (23 - 8√5)²
      * CD² = 256 + 529 - 368√5 + 320

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  An inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

**Step 2: Apply the theorems to find the measures of angles CAB and CDB.**

* **∠CAB:**  Arc AB is intercepted by inscribed angle CAB. Since the central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees, the inscribed angle CAB is half of that, which is 45 degrees.

**Step 1: Identify Relevant Angles**

* We need to find the measure of angle AED. 
* Notice that angle AED is part of triangle AED.
* To find angle AED, we need to know the measures of the other two angles in triangle AED: angle EAD and angle EDA.

**Step 2: Find Angle EAD**

* We know that AB is parallel to CD and angle A is 45 degrees.
* Since AB is parallel to CD, angle A and angle CDA are alternate interior angles.
* Alternate interior angles are equal, so angle CDA is also 45 degrees.
* Angle EAD is the sum of angle CDA and angle CAD.
* Therefore, angle EAD = 45 degrees + 110 degrees = 155 degrees.

**Step 3: Find Angle EDA**

* We know that BC is parallel to DE and angle C is 110 degrees.
* Since BC is parallel to DE, angle C and angle EDC are alternate interior angles.
* Alternate interior angles are equal, so angle EDC is also 110 degrees.
* Angle EDA is the sum of angle EDC and angle CDA.

The image shows a right triangle with sides labeled a, b, and c. We are given the lengths of all three sides: a = 14, b = 48, and c = 50. The problem asks us to find the cosine of angle A (cosA).

## 2. Solution Journey:

**Step 1: Understand Cosine**

Cosine is a trigonometric function that relates the angle of a right triangle to the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In our case, we want to find cosA, so we need to identify the adjacent side and the hypotenuse with respect to angle A.

* **Adjacent Side:** The side next to angle A, which is side b.
* **Hypotenuse:** The longest side of the right triangle, which is side c.

**Step 2: Apply the Cosine Formula**

The formula for cosine is:

cos(angle) = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse)

In our case, this becomes:

cosA = b / c

**Step 3: Substitute the Values**

We know that b = 48 and c = 50. Substitute these values into the formula:

cosA = 48 / 50

## Solution Journey:

**Step 1: Identify Key Properties**

* **Tangents and Radii:**  Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. This means PA = PB.
* **Angle at the Center:** The angle subtended by an arc at the center of a circle is twice the angle subtended by the same arc at any point on the circumference.

The image shows a rhombus with one diagonal labeled '2x' and the other labeled 'x'. We are given that the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters. The problem asks us to find the lengths of both diagonals.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Area Formula**

   The area of a rhombus is calculated by half the product of its diagonals.  This can be represented by the formula:

   Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2

   Where:
   * d1 = length of the first diagonal

## Solution Journey:

**Step 1: Identify Key Relationships**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Since angle C is 30 degrees, the arc AB (the arc intercepted by angle C) is 60 degrees.

* **Central Angle Theorem:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, the central angle AOB (which intercepts arc AB) is also 60 degrees.

**1. Problem Breakdown:**

The image shows a diagram with angles and lines. The question asks us to find the measure of angle FAE, given that angle BEC is 35 degrees, and BE and CE are angle bisectors.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Step 1: Understand Angle Bisectors**
   *  BE bisects angle FBD, meaning it divides angle FBD into two equal angles: ∠FBE = ∠EBD.
   *  CE bisects angle ACD, meaning it divides angle ACD into two equal angles: ∠ACE = ∠ECD.

* **Step 2:  Identify Key Angles**
   *  We are given that ∠BEC = 35°.
   *  Notice that ∠BEC is an exterior angle of triangle BCE.  The exterior angle theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.  Therefore:
      * ∠BEC = ∠BCE + ∠CBE

* **Step 3:  Apply Angle Bisector Properties**
   *  Since BE bisects ∠FBD, we know ∠FBE = ∠EBD.
   *  Since CE bisects ∠ACD, we know ∠ACE = ∠ECD.

* **Step 4:  Solve for ∠BCE and ∠CBE**
   *  Let's represent ∠FBE = ∠EBD as 'x' and ∠ACE = ∠ECD as 'y'.

## 2. Solution Journey:

**Step 1: Understand the Area Formula**

The area of a parallelogram is calculated by multiplying the length of its base by the height perpendicular to that base. 

* **Formula:** Area = base * height

**Step 2: Identify the Base and Height**

We can choose any side of the parallelogram as the base. Let's choose BC as the base.  The height is the perpendicular distance from the opposite side (AD) to the base BC.

* **Secant 2:** Length = 12.25 + 2x (whole secant)
    * External segment: Length = 12.25

According to the Secant-Secant Theorem:

(9 + x) * 9 = (12.25 + 2x) * 12.25

The image shows a circle with a diameter AB, a tangent line DC, and an angle A. We need to find the measure of angle D.

## Solution Journey:

1. **Identify Key Relationships:**
   * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:**  A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OCB = 90°.
   * **Angles in a Triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180°.

2. **Apply the Tangent-Radius Theorem:**
   * Since ∠OCB = 90°, we know that triangle OCB is a right triangle.

3. **Find ∠BOC:**
   * We know ∠A = 25°. Since AB is a diameter, ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the entire circle, making it a right angle (90°).
   * In triangle ACB, we can find ∠B: ∠B = 180° - ∠A - ∠ACB = 180° - 25° - 90° = 65°.
   * Since ∠BOC is the central angle corresponding to ∠B, it is twice the measure of ∠B: ∠BOC = 2 * ∠B = 2 * 65° = 130°.

4. **Find ∠D:**
   * In triangle ODC, we have: ∠D = 180° - ∠DOC - ∠OCB = 180° - 130° - 90° = -40°.

## Reaching the Answer:

The final answer is **∠D = -40°**. However, angles are typically measured between 0° and 360°.  Since the angle is negative, we can add 360° to find the equivalent positive angle: ∠D = -40° + 360° = **320°**.

The image shows a circle with center B.  We are given that CE = 13.5 and AB = 8.  We need to find the length of BD.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Step 1: Identify Key Relationships**
   *  We know that AB is a radius of the circle, and CE is a chord.  
   *  BD is also a radius of the circle, and it is perpendicular to the chord CE.
   *  This means that BD bisects CE (cuts it in half).

* **Step 2: Apply the Bisector Theorem**
   *  Since BD bisects CE, we know that CD = DE = CE/2.
   *  Therefore, CD = DE = 13.5 / 2 = 6.75

* **Step 3: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**
   *  We now have a right triangle BCD, where BD is the hypotenuse, BC is a leg, and CD is a leg.
   *  We know that BC = AB = 8 (both are radii of the circle).
   *  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BD:  BD² = BC² + CD²

* **Step 4: Solve for BD**
   *  Substitute the values we know: BD² = 8² + 6.75²

**2. Solution Journey:**

**Step 1:  Identify Key Properties**

* **Rhombus Properties:**  A rhombus has all sides equal, opposite angles equal, and diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
* **Midpoint Theorem:**  The line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

**Step 2:  Apply the Midpoint Theorem**

* Consider triangle ABD.  E and F are the midpoints of AB and AD respectively.  Therefore, according to the midpoint theorem, EF is parallel to BD and EF = 1/2 BD.

**Step 3:  Find BD (Diagonal of the Rhombus)**

* Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BD.
* In right triangle AOB (where O is the intersection of the diagonals), we have:
    * AO = AC/2 = 6/2 = 3 (half the length of diagonal AC)
    * AB = 5 (given)
* Applying the Pythagorean theorem:

The image shows a triangle with two sides labeled 7 and 12. The question asks us to determine which of the following options cannot be the perimeter of this triangle.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Understanding the Triangle Inequality Theorem:** The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. This theorem helps us determine if a set of side lengths can form a triangle.

* **Applying the Theorem:** Let's analyze the given side lengths (7 and 12) and the possible perimeters to see if they satisfy the Triangle Inequality Theorem:

    * **Perimeter 1:** If the perimeter is 18, the third side would be 18 - 7 - 12 = -1. This is not possible as a side length cannot be negative.

    * **Perimeter 2:** If the perimeter is 19, the third side would be 19 - 7 - 12 = 0. This is also not possible as a side length cannot be zero.

    * **Perimeter 3:** If the perimeter is 20, the third side would be 20 - 7 - 12 = 1. This satisfies the Triangle Inequality Theorem as 1 + 7 > 12, 1 + 12 > 7, and 7 + 12 > 1.

    * **Perimeter 4:** If the perimeter is 21, the third side would be 21 - 7 - 12 = 2. This satisfies the Triangle Inequality Theorem as 2 + 7 > 12, 2 + 12 > 7, and 7 + 12 > 2.

The image shows a triangle ABC with two internal angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. We are given that angle A is 110 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle BOC.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Step 1: Understanding Angle Bisectors**
   * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.  Therefore, ∠ABO = ∠CBO and ∠ACO = ∠BCO.

* **Step 2: Applying the Angle Sum Property of a Triangle**
   * The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.  So, in triangle ABC:
      * ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
      * 110° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
      * ∠B + ∠C = 70°

* **Step 3: Using the Angle Bisector Property**
   * Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, we can write:
      * ∠B = 2 * ∠ABO = 2 * ∠CBO
      * ∠C = 2 * ∠ACO = 2 * ∠BCO

* **Step 4: Focusing on Triangle BOC**
   * In triangle BOC, we have:
      * ∠BOC + ∠BCO + ∠CBO = 180°

   * Substitute the value of ∠B + ∠C = 70° from Step 2 into the equation from Step 4:
      * ∠BOC + (1/2)(70°) = 180°

## Solution Journey:

**Step 1: Find ∠A**

* **Reasoning:**  The angles in a triangle add up to 180°.
* **Formula:** ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
* **Applying the formula:** ∠A + 58° + 90° = 180°
* **Solving for ∠A:** ∠A = 180° - 58° - 90° = 32°

**Step 2: Find ∠2**

* **Reasoning:**  When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal.
* **Applying the reasoning:** ∠2 is corresponding to ∠B, so ∠2 = ∠B = 58°

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Properties of Parallelograms**
    * **Diagonals bisect each other:** In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. This means that point O is the midpoint of both AC and BD.
    * **Equal opposite sides:** Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length. Therefore, AD = BC and AB = CD.

## Solution Journey:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the smallest possible perimeter of triangle AMN. This means we need to find the shortest possible distances from point A to points M and N.

2. **Using the Law of Reflection:**  The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.  Imagine point A as a light source.  The light will reflect off the lines BC and CD to reach points M and N respectively.  The path of the reflected light will be the shortest possible path.

3. **Applying the Law of Reflection:**  The angle of incidence (angle between the incoming light ray and the normal to the surface) is equal to the angle of reflection (angle between the reflected light ray and the normal to the surface).

4. **Finding the Optimal Points:**  To minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, we need to find points M and N where the angles of incidence and reflection are equal at both BC and CD.

5. **Constructing the Solution:**
    * Draw a line from point A perpendicular to BC, intersecting BC at point M.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Step 1: Understand Symmetry**
   * Symmetry means that if you fold the figure along the line of symmetry, the two halves will perfectly overlap.
   * Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, this means that line MP is the perpendicular bisector of line AB.  
   * Similarly, line NQ is the perpendicular bisector of line AC.

* **Step 2: Identify Key Angles**
   * Because MP is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP = 90°.
   * Similarly, ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ = 90°.

* **Step 3: Apply Angle Properties**
   * The angles around a point add up to 360°.  Therefore, ∠AMP + ∠PAM + ∠MAP = 360°.
   * Since ∠AMP = 90° and ∠PAM = ∠MAP (due to symmetry), we can write: 90° + 2∠PAM = 360°.
   * Solving for ∠PAM, we get ∠PAM = (360° - 90°) / 2 = 135°.

* **Step 4: Find ∠PAQ**
   * We know that ∠BAC = 110°.  
   * Since ∠PAM = 135° and ∠QAN = 135° (due to symmetry), we can find ∠PAQ:

The image shows a circle with two chords intersecting outside the circle.  We are given that one angle formed by the intersection is 30 degrees, and the other angle is 3x degrees.  The angle formed inside the circle by one of the chords is (4x + 50) degrees.  We need to find the value of x.

## Solution Journey:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  The problem involves angles formed by intersecting chords outside a circle.  The relevant theorem is the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**, which states that the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting outside a circle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

2. **Apply the theorem:**  Let's label the intercepted arcs as follows:
    * Arc 1: The arc intercepted by the angle 3x degrees.
    * Arc 2: The arc intercepted by the angle (4x + 50) degrees.

    According to the Intersecting Chords Theorem:
    * 3x = (1/2) * (Arc 2 - Arc 1)
    * 30 = (1/2) * (Arc 1 - Arc 2)

3. **Solve for the intercepted arcs:**  We have two equations with two unknowns (Arc 1 and Arc 2).  We can solve for these arcs using a system of equations:
    * Multiply the first equation by 2: 6x = Arc 2 - Arc 1
    * Multiply the second equation by 2: 60 = Arc 1 - Arc 2
    * Add the two equations together: 6x + 60 = 0
    * Simplify: 6x = -60

The image shows an isosceles right triangle with sides of length 'a'. We need to find the y-coordinate of its center of mass.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Understanding Center of Mass:** The center of mass of an object is the point where its entire mass can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object like a triangle, the center of mass lies at its geometric center.

* **Finding the Geometric Center:**  The geometric center of a triangle is the point where its medians intersect. A median is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

* **Using Symmetry:** Since the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, we can use symmetry to simplify the process. The median from the right angle vertex will pass through the midpoint of the hypotenuse and also be the line of symmetry.

* **Finding the Midpoint:** The midpoint of the hypotenuse is at a distance of 'a/2' from the base of the triangle.

* **Finding the y-coordinate:** Since the median from the right angle vertex is also the line of symmetry, the y-coordinate of the center of mass will be the same as the y-coordinate of the midpoint of the hypotenuse.

The image shows an infinite chain of resistors, each with a resistance of 'R'. We need to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b'.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Step 1:  Identify the repeating pattern.**
   * Notice that the circuit has a repeating pattern of three resistors in parallel followed by one resistor in series. 

* **Step 2:  Simplify the repeating pattern.**
   * **Parallel Resistors:** The three resistors in parallel have an equivalent resistance (Rp) calculated using the formula:
      * 1/Rp = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
      * Rp = R/3

   * **Series Resistors:** The equivalent resistance of the series combination (Rs) is simply the sum of the individual resistances:
      * Rs = Rp + R = R/3 + R = 4R/3

* **Step 3:  Represent the infinite chain as a simplified circuit.**
   * Imagine the infinite chain as a single equivalent resistance (Req) connected to the repeating pattern (Rs).

* **Step 4:  Apply the concept of self-similarity.**
   * The equivalent resistance (Req) of the entire infinite chain is the same as the resistance of the repeating pattern (Rs) plus the equivalent resistance of the rest of the chain (Req). This is because the chain is infinite and the pattern repeats.
      * Req = Rs + Req

* **Step 5:  Solve for Req.**
   * Substitute Rs = 4R/3 into the equation:
      * Req = 4R/3 + Req
      * 0 = 4R/3
      * Req = -4R/3

* **Step 6:  Interpret the result.**
   * The negative value for Req indicates that the equivalent resistance is infinite. This makes sense because the chain extends infinitely, and the current would never reach the end.

**3. Reaching the Answer:**

The equivalent resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is **infinite**.  Since R = 1, the final answer is **infinity**.

## 2. Solution Journey:

**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Central Angles**

* **Reasoning:** The angles formed at the center of a circle (central angles) are equal to the measure of the arc they intercept.
* **Formula:**  Central Angle = Arc Measure

**Step 2: Apply the Concept to the Problem**

* **Reasoning:** The central angles ∠RCM, ∠MCN, and ∠NCL together form a complete circle, which has a measure of 360°.

**1. Problem Breakdown:**

The image shows a regular hexagon ABCDEF with point O as its center. We need to find the value of angle x, which is formed by connecting point B to point O.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Step 1: Understanding Regular Hexagons**
    * A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles.
    * The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is (6-2) * 180° = 720°.

The image shows a circle with a triangle inscribed inside it.  We need to find the value of 'x' that makes the angles of the triangle consistent with the properties of inscribed angles.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Step 1: Identify the Inscribed Angle**
   * The angle at point 'C' is an inscribed angle because its vertex lies on the circle, and its sides are chords of the circle.

* **Step 2: Identify the Central Angle**
   * The angle formed by the two radii connecting the center of the circle to points 'C' and 'E' is the central angle that intercepts the same arc as the inscribed angle at 'C'.

* **Step 3: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
   * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted central angle.
   * In this case, the inscribed angle at 'C' is (5x - 12) degrees, and the central angle is 3x degrees.  Therefore:
      * (5x - 12) = (1/2) * 3x

## Solution Journey:

1. **Understanding Tangent Properties:**
   * **Key Property:** A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.
   * **Applying it:** This means ∠OBC = ∠OCD = 90 degrees.

2. **Identifying Relevant Angles:**
   * **Focus on Triangle OBC:** We know ∠OBC = 90 degrees and ∠OCB = ∠ACE = 25 degrees (since they are alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines).
   * **Using Angle Sum Property:** The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, ∠BOC = 180 - 90 - 25 = 65 degrees.

3. **Finding ∠BOD:**
   * **Central Angle Property:** The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
   * **Applying it:** ∠BOD is a central angle intercepting arc BC, and ∠BOC is an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc. Therefore, ∠BOD = 2 * ∠BOC = 2 * 65 = 130 degrees.

4. **Calculating ∠D:**
   * **Focus on Triangle BOD:** We know ∠BOD = 130 degrees and ∠OBD = 90 degrees.
   * **Using Angle Sum Property:** ∠D = 180 - 130 - 90 = -40 degrees.

5. **Adjusting for Correct Angle:**
   * **Angle Convention:** Angles are typically measured between 0 and 360 degrees.

The image shows a triangle ABC with an internal point F where two angle bisectors intersect.  We are given that CG is perpendicular to AB and ∠ACG = 32°. The question asks us to find the measure of ∠BFC.

**2. Solution Journey:**

**Step 1: Identify Key Properties**

* **Angle Bisectors:**  Lines BE and CD are angle bisectors, meaning they divide the angles ∠ABC and ∠ACB into two equal angles.
* **Perpendicular Lines:** CG is perpendicular to AB, meaning ∠CGD = 90°.

**Step 2: Apply Angle Properties**

* **Angle Sum Property of a Triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180°.  Therefore, in triangle ACG:
    * ∠CAG + ∠ACG + ∠AGC = 180°
    * ∠CAG + 32° + 90° = 180°
    * ∠CAG = 58°

* **Angle Bisector Property:** Since CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, we have:
    * ∠ACD = ∠BCD

**Step 3: Find ∠BFC**

* **Focus on Triangle BFC:**  We need to find the measure of ∠BFC.  We can use the angle sum property of triangle BFC:
    * ∠BFC + ∠FBC + ∠FCB = 180°

* **Break Down the Angles:**
    * ∠FBC = 1/2 ∠ABC (since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC)
    * ∠FCB = 1/2 ∠ACB (since CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB)

* **Substitute and Solve:**
    * ∠BFC + (1/2 ∠ABC) + (1/2 ∠ACB) = 180°
    * ∠BFC = 180° - (1/2 ∠ABC) - (1/2 ∠ACB)

* **Use the Angle Sum Property of Triangle ABC:**
    * ∠ABC + ∠ACB + ∠BAC = 180°
    * ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180° - ∠BAC

* **Substitute and Simplify:**
    * ∠BFC = 180° - (1/2 (180° - ∠BAC))
    * ∠BFC = 180° - 90° + (1/2 ∠BAC)
    * ∠BFC = 90° + (1/2 ∠BAC)

* **Find ∠BAC:**
    * ∠BAC = 180° - ∠CAG - ∠CAB (using the angle sum property of triangle ABC)
    * ∠BAC = 180° - 58° - 90° = 32°

* **Calculate ∠BFC:**
    * ∠BFC = 90° + (1/2 * 32°) = 90° + 16° = 106°

**3. Reaching the Answer:**

The final simplified answer is **∠BFC = 106°**.

955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"## Analyzing the Image and Solving the Problem

**1. Problem Breakdown:**

The image shows a regular pentagon (ABCDE) inscribed in a circle with center O. We need to find the measure of angle ADE.

**2. Solution Journey:**

* **Step 1: Understanding the Properties of Regular Polygons**

   * A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal.
   * The sum of interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees.

* **Step 2: Finding the Measure of Each Interior Angle of the Pentagon**

   * Since the pentagon has 5 sides (n=5), the sum of its interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.
   * Each interior angle of the regular pentagon measures 540 degrees / 5 = 108 degrees.

* **Step 3: Recognizing the Central Angle**

   * Angle AOE is a central angle of the pentagon, formed by connecting two adjacent vertices of the pentagon to the center of the circle.
   * The measure of a central angle is equal to 360 degrees divided by the number of sides of the polygon.

* **Step 4: Calculating the Measure of Angle AOE**

   * Angle AOE measures 360 degrees / 5 = 72 degrees.

* **Step 5: Applying the Triangle Angle Sum Property**

   * Triangle ADE is an isosceles triangle (AD = AE, as they are radii of the circle).
   * The sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.

* **Step 6: Finding the Measure of Angle ADE**

   * Let x be the measure of angle ADE (and angle AED, as they are equal).
   * We have: x + x + 72 degrees = 180 degrees
   * Solving for x: 2x = 108 degrees
   * Therefore, x = 54 degrees.

**3. Reaching the Answer:**

The measure of angle ADE is **54 degrees**.

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"## Problem Breakdown:

The image shows two line segments intersecting at a point on line l. We are given that one angle measures 70 degrees and the other two angles are labeled x and y. The problem asks us to find the value of y, given that y is equal to the square of x.

## Solution Journey:

1. **Identify the relationship between the angles:** The angles x, y, and 70 degrees form a straight angle.  A straight angle always measures 180 degrees.

2. **Write an equation:** We can express the relationship between the angles as an equation: x + y + 70 = 180

3. **Simplify the equation:** Combine the constant terms: x + y = 110

4. **Solve for x:**  We know that y = x², so we can substitute this into the equation: x + x² = 110

5. **Rearrange the equation:**  This is a quadratic equation. Rearrange it into standard form: x² + x - 110 = 0

6. **Factor the quadratic equation:**  Factor the equation to find the possible values of x: (x + 11)(x - 10) = 0

7. **Solve for x:**  This gives us two possible solutions: x = -11 or x = 10. Since angles cannot be negative, we discard x = -11.

8. **Find the value of y:**  We know y = x², and we found x = 10. Therefore, y = 10² = 100.

## Reaching the Answer:

The value of y is **100**.
