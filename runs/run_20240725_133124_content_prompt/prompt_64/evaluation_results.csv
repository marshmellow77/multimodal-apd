643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. **Problem:** The problem asks us to find the measure of angle C (∠C) in a circle. We know that CD is the diameter of the circle, which means it passes through the center of the circle (point O). We also know that chord DE is parallel to line segment OA, and that angle D (∠D) measures 50 degrees. 

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key relationships:** Since CD is the diameter, we know that angle COD is a straight angle, meaning it measures 180 degrees.  Also, because DE is parallel to OA, we have alternate interior angles: ∠D = ∠COA = 50 degrees.

   2. **Find angle AOC:**  We can find angle AOC by subtracting the known angle COA from the straight angle COD: ∠AOC = ∠COD - ∠COA = 180° - 50° = 130°.

   3. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In our case, angle C (∠C) is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AD. Angle AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc AD. Therefore, ∠C = 1/2 * ∠AOC.

   4. **Calculate angle C:**  Using the value we found for ∠AOC, we can calculate ∠C: ∠C = 1/2 * 130° = 65°.

3. **Answer:** The degree of ∠C is 65°.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a right triangle. We know one of the angles is 60 degrees, and the length of the side opposite that angle is 4. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is the side opposite the right angle and is labeled 'h'.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We have the opposite side and need to find the hypotenuse. The trigonometric ratio that relates opposite and hypotenuse is sine (sin). 
   2. **Write the formula:**  sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse

   4. **Solve for h:**
      * Multiply both sides by h: h * sin(60°) = 4
      * Divide both sides by sin(60°): h = 4 / sin(60°)
      * Calculate sin(60°) using a calculator or trigonometric table: sin(60°) ≈ 0.866
      * Substitute the value: h ≈ 4 / 0.866

1. **Problem:** The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AOC (∠AOC) in the diagram.  We know that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle, meaning all its vertices touch the circle's edge. We also know that angle ABC (∠ABC) is 70 degrees.  

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Understanding Inscribed Angles:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share the same endpoint.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

   2. **Identifying the Central Angle:**  In our problem, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle, and ∠AOC is the central angle that intercepts the same arc (arc AC).

   3. **Applying the Formula:**  Using the relationship between inscribed and central angles, we can say: ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC

318,Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.,2256,"##  Let's break down this geometry problem together!

1. **Problem:** The image shows a shape that looks like a rectangle with a slanted side. We need to find the area of this shape.  Think of it like finding out how much space this shape takes up on a flat surface.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Divide the shape.**  We can split this shape into two familiar figures: a rectangle and a triangle.  Imagine drawing a line straight down from the top corner of the slanted side to the bottom, forming a right angle. This divides the shape into a rectangle and a triangle.

   * **Step 2: Find the area of the rectangle.** The rectangle has a length of 41 feet and a width of 48 feet.  To find the area of a rectangle, we multiply length by width. 
      * Formula: Area of rectangle = length * width
      * Calculation: Area of rectangle = 41 ft * 48 ft = 1968 square feet

   * **Step 3: Find the base of the triangle.** The base of the triangle is the same as the length of the rectangle, which is 41 feet.

   * **Step 4: Find the height of the triangle.** The height of the triangle is the difference between the total height of the shape (48 feet) and the height of the rectangle (41 feet).
      * Calculation: Height of triangle = 48 ft - 41 ft = 7 ft

   * **Step 5: Find the area of the triangle.** The area of a triangle is calculated by multiplying the base by the height and then dividing by 2.
      * Formula: Area of triangle = (base * height) / 2
      * Calculation: Area of triangle = (41 ft * 7 ft) / 2 = 143.5 square feet

   * **Step 6: Add the areas together.** To find the total area of the shape, we add the area of the rectangle and the area of the triangle.
      * Calculation: Total area = 1968 square feet + 143.5 square feet = 2111.5 square feet

If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"1. **Problem:** The problem asks us to find the radius of the smaller circle. We know that the radius of the larger circle is 4, and that the center of the smaller circle (Q) lies on the line that passes through the center of the larger circle (P) and a point on the larger circle (R).

2. **Solution:**
   1. **Visualize:** Imagine drawing a line segment from P to Q. This line segment is the radius of the smaller circle.
   2. **Connect the dots:** Now, imagine drawing a line segment from P to R. This line segment is the radius of the larger circle, which we know is 4.
   3. **The whole is the sum of its parts:** Notice that the line segment PR is made up of two smaller line segments: PQ (the radius of the smaller circle) and QR (the remaining part of the line segment).
   4. **Deduction:** Since Q lies on the line PR, and PR is the radius of the larger circle, we can deduce that PQ is half the length of PR.

The first three triangles have all their numbers filled in, while the last triangle has one number missing. We need to figure out what the missing number is by finding a pattern in the numbers of the other triangles.

2. **Solution:**

1. **Problem:** The image shows two lines, AB and CD, intersecting at point O.  A ray OE is drawn, dividing the angle BOC into two equal parts. We know that angle AOD is 70 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AOE.

##  Solving the Problem

1. **Identify the key angles:** We need to find the measure of angle AOE.  We know that angle AOD is 70 degrees.  We also know that ray OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides angle BOC into two equal angles.

2. **Find the measure of angle BOC:**  Angles AOD and BOC are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle BOC = 180 degrees - angle AOD = 180 degrees - 70 degrees = 110 degrees.

3. **Find the measure of angle BOE:** Since ray OE bisects angle BOC, angle BOE is half the measure of angle BOC.  Therefore, angle BOE = angle BOC / 2 = 110 degrees / 2 = 55 degrees.

4. **Find the measure of angle AOE:**  Angles AOB and BOE are adjacent angles, meaning they share a common side (OB) and form a straight angle (180 degrees).  Therefore, angle AOE = 180 degrees - angle BOE = 180 degrees - 55 degrees = 125 degrees.

1. **Problem:** The image shows four charged particles arranged in a square. We need to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force acting on particle 3. This means we need to figure out how much force each of the other particles exerts on particle 3 in the horizontal direction (along the x-axis), and then add those forces together.

##  Solving the Problem

1. **Identify the forces:** Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces from particles 1, 2, and 4. 
    * **Force from particle 1:** This force is purely vertical (along the y-axis) because particles 1 and 3 are aligned vertically. So, it doesn't contribute to the x-component of the net force.
    * **Force from particle 2:** This force is diagonal, but we can break it down into horizontal (x-component) and vertical (y-component) components. We are only interested in the x-component.
    * **Force from particle 4:** This force is purely horizontal (along the x-axis) because particles 3 and 4 are aligned horizontally.

2. **Calculate the force from particle 2:**
    * **Coulomb's Law:** We use Coulomb's Law to calculate the electrostatic force between two charged particles:
        *  F = k * |q1 * q2| / r²
        *  Where:
            * F is the force between the charges
            * k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²)
            * q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges
            * r is the distance between the charges
    * **Applying Coulomb's Law:**
        * F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / (√2 * a)²  (The distance between particles 2 and 3 is the diagonal of the square, which is √2 * a)
        * F23 = (8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²) * (100 × 10⁻⁹ C) * (200 × 10⁻⁹ C) / (√2 * 0.05 m)²
        * F23 ≈ 0.36 N
    * **Finding the x-component:** The x-component of the force from particle 2 is F23 * cos(45°) (because the angle between the force and the x-axis is 45 degrees).
        * F23x = 0.36 N * cos(45°) ≈ 0.25 N

3. **Calculate the force from particle 4:**
    * **Coulomb's Law:**
        * F43 = k * |q4 * q3| / a²
        * F43 = (8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²) * (200 × 10⁻⁹ C) * (200 × 10⁻⁹ C) / (0.05 m)²
        * F43 ≈ 1.44 N

4. **Add the x-components:**
    * The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of the forces from particles 2 and 4.
    * Fnetx = F23x + F43
    * Fnetx ≈ 0.25 N + 1.44 N ≈ 1.69 N

##  Answer

The x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is approximately 1.69 N.

1. **Problem:** The image shows two parallel lines intersected by another line. We know that angle 1 measures 123 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle 14.  

   * **Parallel lines:** These are lines that never intersect, like the two blue lines in the image.
   * **Intersecting lines:** These are lines that cross each other, like the red line crossing the blue lines.
   * **Angles:** When lines intersect, they create angles.  An angle is the space between two lines that meet at a point.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify corresponding angles:**  Angles 1 and 14 are called corresponding angles. They are in the same position relative to the parallel lines and the intersecting line. 
   2. **Corresponding angles are equal:**  A key rule in geometry is that corresponding angles formed by parallel lines are always equal.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a right triangle with sides labeled J, K, and L. We know the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is 14, and one of the other sides is 9. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle J, which is the angle opposite the side with length 9.  

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio.** We need to use a trigonometric ratio (sine, cosine, or tangent) to relate the angle J to the sides we know. Since we know the hypotenuse (14) and the side opposite angle J (9), we'll use the sine function. 
   * **Step 2: Write the sine function.** The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.  So, we can write: 
      * sin(J) = opposite / hypotenuse = 9 / 14
   * **Step 3: Use the inverse sine function.** To find the measure of angle J, we need to use the inverse sine function (also called arcsine), denoted as sin⁻¹ or asin. This function ""undoes"" the sine function. 
      * J = sin⁻¹(9/14)
   * **Step 4: Calculate the angle.** Use a calculator to find the arcsine of (9/14). Make sure your calculator is set to degrees mode.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with center O, and two lines PA and PB that are tangent to the circle at points A and B, respectively.  A line segment CD is drawn, where C is on PA and D is on PB, and CD is also tangent to the circle. We know that PA = 8.0, and we need to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

   * **Perimeter:** The perimeter of a triangle is the total length of all its sides added together. In this case, we need to find the lengths of PC, CD, and PD and add them up.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Understanding Tangents:**  A tangent line to a circle touches the circle at exactly one point.  An important property of tangents is that the line segment from the center of the circle to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. This means that angles OAC and OBD are both right angles.

   2. **Congruent Segments:**  Since PA and PB are both tangents to the circle from the same point P, they are congruent (equal in length).  Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.

   3. **Right Triangles:**  Triangles OAC and OBD are both right triangles.  We know that OA and OB are radii of the circle, and we know that AC and BD are tangents.  Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of AC and BD.

     * **Pythagorean Theorem:** In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In this case, we have:
       *  AC² = OA² + OC²
       *  BD² = OB² + OD²

   4. **Finding CD:**  Since CD is tangent to the circle, it is perpendicular to the radius OE.  Therefore, triangle OEC and triangle OED are both right triangles.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the lengths of CE and DE.

     *  CE² = OE² + OC²
     *  DE² = OE² + OD²

   5. **Perimeter of △PCD:**  Now that we know the lengths of all the sides of triangle PCD, we can add them up to find the perimeter:

     *  Perimeter of △PCD = PC + CD + PD = (PA - AC) + (CE + DE) + (PB - BD)

3. **Answer:**  To find the exact answer, we need to know the radius of the circle (OA or OB).  Without that information, we can only express the perimeter in terms of the radius:

   *  Perimeter of △PCD = (8 - √(OA² + OC²)) + (√(OE² + OC²) + √(OE² + OD²)) + (8 - √(OB² + OD²))

   *  **Simplifying:**  Since OA = OB = OE, we can simplify the expression:

     *  Perimeter of △PCD = 16 + √(OE² + OC²) + √(OE² + OD²) - √(OA² + OC²) - √(OB² + OD²)

   *  **Final Answer:**  The perimeter of triangle PCD is 16 + √(OE² + OC²) + √(OE² + OD²) - √(OA² + OC²) - √(OB² + OD²).  This answer is in terms of the radius of the circle.  If we know the radius, we can plug it in and calculate the exact numerical value of the perimeter.

We are given that point D is inside the triangle, CD bisects angle ACB, BD is perpendicular to CD, angle A equals angle ABD, and angle DBC is 54 degrees.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Find angle BCD:** Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle BCD is half of angle ACB. We don't know angle ACB yet, so we'll come back to this.

   2. **Find angle BDC:** We know BD is perpendicular to CD, which means angle BDC is a right angle (90 degrees).

   3. **Find angle CBD:** We know angle DBC is 54 degrees. Since angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle CBD: 
      * Angle CBD = 180 degrees - angle BDC - angle DBC

   7. **Find angle A:** We know angle ACB is twice the size of angle BCD. Since angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle A:
      * Angle A = 180 degrees - angle ABC - angle ACB
      * Angle A = 180 degrees - (180 degrees - angle A - 36 degrees) - (2 * angle BCD)
      * Simplifying, we get: 2 * angle A = 36 degrees + 2 * angle BCD
      * Since angle BCD is half of angle ACB, we can substitute: 2 * angle A = 36 degrees + angle ACB

776,Find $JQ$ if $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$.  Rounded to the nearest hundredth.,18.79,"1. **Problem:** The problem asks us to find the length of line segment $JQ$.  We are given that point $Q$ is the incenter of triangle $JLN$.  The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  This means that line segments $KQ$, $LQ$, and $NQ$ all bisect the angles of triangle $JLN$.  We are also given the length of line segment $JN$ as 16.5.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Draw a line segment from point $Q$ to point $N$.  This line segment will bisect angle $JNL$.  Since $Q$ is the incenter, we know that line segment $QN$ is perpendicular to line segment $JN$.  This creates a right triangle, $QJN$.

   * **Step 2:**  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of line segment $QN$.  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In this case, the hypotenuse is $JN$, and the other two sides are $QN$ and $JN$.  So, we have:

     $JN^2 = QN^2 + JN^2$

   * **Step 3:**  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $QN$:

     $QN^2 = JN^2 - JN^2$

   * **Step 4:**  We can plug in the values we know:

     $QN^2 = 16.5^2 - 9^2$

   * **Step 5:**  We can simplify this equation:

     $QN^2 = 272.25 - 81$

     $QN^2 = 191.25$

   * **Step 6:**  We can take the square root of both sides to find $QN$:

     $QN = \sqrt{191.25}$

     $QN \approx 13.83$

   * **Step 7:**  Now that we know the length of $QN$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem again to find the length of $JQ$.  This time, the hypotenuse is $JQ$, and the other two sides are $QN$ and $JN$.  So, we have:

     $JQ^2 = QN^2 + JN^2$

   * **Step 8:**  We can plug in the values we know:

     $JQ^2 = 13.83^2 + 9^2$

   * **Step 9:**  We can simplify this equation:

     $JQ^2 = 191.25 + 81$

     $JQ^2 = 272.25$

   * **Step 10:**  We can take the square root of both sides to find $JQ$:

     $JQ = \sqrt{272.25}$

1. **Problem:** The image shows a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of side AB. The bisector intersects AB at point D and BC at point E. We are asked to find the perimeter of triangle ABC, given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13.

   * **In simpler terms:** We have a triangle, and a line cuts one of its sides exactly in half at a right angle. We know the length of the cut side and the perimeter of a smaller triangle formed by the line. We need to find the perimeter of the whole triangle.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Understanding Perpendicular Bisectors:** A perpendicular bisector cuts a line segment into two equal parts and forms a right angle with it. This means AD = DB = 3.

   2. **Using the Perimeter:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides. So, for triangle ACE, we have: AC + CE + AE = 13.

   3. **Finding AC:** Since AD is a perpendicular bisector, we know that AE = CE. Therefore, we can rewrite the perimeter equation as: AC + 2AE = 13.

   4. **Finding BC:**  We know that AB = 6 and AD = 3. Therefore, BD = 3. Since DE is a perpendicular bisector, we know that BE = EC.  So, BC = BE + EC = 2EC.

   5. **Finding the Perimeter of ABC:** The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC. We know AB = 6, and we can substitute the values we found for BC and AC from steps 3 and 4: 6 + 2EC + AC = 6 + 2EC + (13 - 2AE).

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.  Since BE bisects angle ABC, we know that angle ABE = angle CBE. Similarly, since CF bisects angle BCD, we know that angle BCF = angle DCF.

   2. **Using Parallel Lines:**  In a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel. Therefore, AB || CD and AD || BC.  This means that angle ABE = angle CDE (alternate interior angles) and angle CBE = angle CDF (alternate interior angles).

   3. **Combining Information:**  From steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that angle ABE = angle CBE = angle CDE = angle CDF.  This means that triangles ABE and CDE are similar triangles (they have the same angles).

   4. **Similar Triangles and Proportions:**  Similar triangles have proportional sides.  Since AB = 3 and AD = 4, we can set up a proportion:  AB/AD = AE/ED = 3/4.

   5. **Finding EF:**  Since AE/ED = 3/4, we can say that AE = 3x and ED = 4x for some value of x.  Therefore, AD = AE + ED = 3x + 4x = 7x.  We know that AD = 4, so 7x = 4, and x = 4/7.

   6. **Calculating EF:**  EF = AE - AF = 3x - 4x = -x.  Substituting x = 4/7, we get EF = -4/7.  Since length cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of EF, which is 4/7.

A trapezoid is a four-sided shape with at least one pair of parallel sides. We are given the lengths of three sides: AB = 24, AD = 23, and BC = 16. We need to use this information to figure out the length of the missing side, CD.

2. **Solution:**
   1. **Visualize the Trapezoid:** Imagine the trapezoid with its right angles at A and B.  Since AB and CD are parallel, we can think of the trapezoid as a rectangle (ABCD) with a triangle (BCD) attached to one side.

   2. **Find the Height:** The height of the trapezoid is the same as the length of side AB, which is 24.

   3. **Find the Base of the Triangle:** The base of the triangle (BC) is 16.

   4. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse (CD) of the right triangle BCD. The Pythagorean theorem states: a² + b² = c², where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.

      * In our case, 'a' is the height of the trapezoid (AB = 24), and 'b' is the base of the triangle (BC = 16). We want to find 'c', which is CD.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with center O. Point P is outside the circle, and lines PA and PB intersect the circle at points C and D, respectively. We know that the central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees and the central angle of arc CD is 50 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle P (∠P).

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Understanding Central Angles and Inscribed Angles:**  A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. An inscribed angle is an angle whose vertex lies on the circle.  A key relationship is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

   2. **Finding ∠CAB:**  ∠CAB is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CB. Since the central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees, the measure of arc CB is 360 degrees - 90 degrees = 270 degrees. Therefore, ∠CAB = 270 degrees / 2 = 135 degrees.

   3. **Finding ∠PBD:**  ∠PBD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CD. Since the central angle of arc CD is 50 degrees, ∠PBD = 50 degrees / 2 = 25 degrees.

   4. **Using the Angle Sum Property of Triangles:**  In triangle PAB, we know ∠CAB = 135 degrees and ∠PBD = 25 degrees. The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, ∠P = 180 degrees - 135 degrees - 25 degrees = 20 degrees.

We know the circle's area is 18π square units. The problem asks us to find the length of one side of the square.  Think of it like this: imagine you have a round pizza and you want to cut out the biggest possible square piece of pizza. How long would each side of that square piece be?

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Find the circle's radius:** The area of a circle is calculated using the formula: Area = π * radius² (where π is a special number approximately equal to 3.14). We know the area is 18π, so we can set up the equation: 18π = π * radius². To find the radius, we need to get rid of the π on both sides, leaving us with 18 = radius².  To find the radius, we take the square root of both sides: √18 = radius. Simplifying √18, we get 3√2 = radius.

   2. **Connect the radius to the square:** Imagine drawing a line from the center of the circle to one corner of the square. This line is a radius of the circle, and it also forms the diagonal of a smaller right triangle inside the square. The sides of this triangle are half the length of the square's side.

   3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In our triangle, the hypotenuse is the radius (3√2), and the other two sides are half the length of the square's side. Let's call half the side length 'x'. So, the Pythagorean Theorem becomes: (3√2)² = x² + x².

   4. **Solve for the side length:** Simplifying the equation, we get 18 = 2x². Dividing both sides by 2, we get 9 = x². Taking the square root of both sides, we get √9 = x, which means x = 3. Remember, 'x' is half the side length of the square. To find the full side length, we multiply x by 2: 3 * 2 = 6.

##  Solving the Problem

1. **Identify the relationship between angles:**  Angle ADC and angle ACB are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc, AC.  This means they are equal in measure.  Therefore, ∠ACB = ∠ADC = 26°.

2. **Recognize the special property of the diameter:**  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, angle ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle.  This means angle ACB is a right angle, or 90°.

3. **Apply the angle sum property of triangles:**  In triangle ABC, we know ∠ACB = 90° and ∠CAB + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°.  We also know ∠ACB = 26°.  Therefore, ∠CAB + ∠ABC = 180° - 26° = 154°.

4. **Recognize the relationship between angles:**  Angle ABC and angle ADC are supplementary angles because they form a linear pair.  This means they add up to 180°.  Therefore, ∠ABC = 180° - ∠ADC = 180° - 26° = 154°.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.** A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle, with its vertex at the center of the circle. An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle, with its vertex on the circle's circumference.  A key relationship is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.

We also know that angle A is 45 degrees and angle C is 110 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AED.

   * **Parallel lines:**  Parallel lines are lines that never intersect, no matter how far they are extended.
   * **Angles:** An angle is the space between two lines that meet at a point. We measure angles in degrees.

##  Solving the Problem

1. **Identify corresponding angles:** Since AB is parallel to CD, and BC is parallel to DE, we have pairs of corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection of the parallel lines. 

   * **Example:** Angle A and angle C are corresponding angles because they are both on the same side of the transversal (line BC) and in the same relative position.

2. **Corresponding angles are equal:**  A key property of parallel lines is that corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle C is also 45 degrees.

3. **Angles on a straight line:**  Angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.  Angle C and angle CED are on a straight line, so:

   * **Base and height:** The base of a triangle can be any of its sides, and the height is the perpendicular distance from the opposite vertex to that base.

##  Solving the Problem

1. **Find the height of triangle ACD:** Since we know the area of triangle ACD (12) and the length of its base (DC = 1), we can use the area formula to find its height.

   * **Area formula:** Area = (1/2) * base * height

Another line segment BM is perpendicular to AM, forming a right angle at point M.  We are given that AB = 8 and MN = 2. The problem asks us to find the length of AC.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the length of AC, which is one of the sides of the triangle. We are given the length of AB and MN, and we know that N is the midpoint of BC.  We also know that AM bisects angle BAC and BM is perpendicular to AM.

   2. **Using the Midpoint Property:** Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know that BN = NC.  This means that BC = 2 * BN.

   3. **Finding BN:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BN.  We know that BM is perpendicular to AM, so triangle BMN is a right triangle.  We are given that MN = 2, and we can find BM using the fact that AM bisects angle BAC.  Since AM bisects angle BAC, we know that angle BAM = angle CAM.  Therefore, triangles BAM and CAM are congruent (they have the same angles and the same side AM).  This means that BM = CM.  Since we know that AB = 8, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BM:

      * BM² + MN² = BN²
      * BM² + 2² = BN²
      * BM² = BN² - 4

      Since BM = CM, we can also write:

      * CM² = BN² - 4

   4. **Finding BC:** Now that we know BM and CM, we can find BC:

      * BC = BN + NC
      * BC = 2 * BN
      * BC = 2 * √(BM² + 4)
      * BC = 2 * √(BN² - 4 + 4)
      * BC = 2 * √(BN²)
      * BC = 2 * BN

   5. **Finding AC:** Finally, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find AC:

      * AC² = AB² + BC²
      * AC² = 8² + (2 * BN)²
      * AC² = 64 + 4 * BN²
      * AC = √(64 + 4 * BN²)

3. **Answer:** To find the final answer, we need to find the value of BN.  We can do this by using the fact that BM = CM and the Pythagorean theorem:

   * BM² + MN² = BN²
   * CM² + MN² = BN²
   * (BN² - 4) + 2² = BN²
   * BN² - 4 + 4 = BN²
   * BN² = BN²

   This means that BN can be any value.  Therefore, we cannot determine the exact length of AC.  The answer is **indeterminate**.

Imagine a right triangle, like the one in the image, where the longest side (called the hypotenuse) is opposite the right angle.  The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is a way to describe the relationship between the length of the side adjacent to the angle (the side next to it) and the length of the hypotenuse. 

2. **Solution:**
   1. **Identify the sides:** We are looking for cos A, so we need to identify the side adjacent to angle A (side b) and the hypotenuse (side c).
   2. **Apply the cosine formula:** The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the adjacent side divided by the length of the hypotenuse.  This can be written as:  cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse.
   3. **Substitute the values:** In this case, we have cos(A) = b / c.  We know that b = 48 and c = 50.
   4. **Calculate the result:**  cos(A) = 48 / 50 = 0.96

1. **Problem:** The problem asks us to find the distance from the center of a circle to a chord.  Imagine a circle like a pizza, and the chord is like a straight line cutting across the pizza. We need to figure out how far the center of the pizza is from that line.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Draw a perpendicular:**  First, we draw a line segment from the center of the circle (point O) to the chord (AB), making sure this line is perpendicular to the chord. This line will be the shortest distance from the center to the chord. Let's call the point where this line intersects the chord point M.

   2. **Recognize the right triangle:** Now, we have a right triangle OMA, where OM is the distance we want to find, OA is the radius of the circle, and AM is half the length of the chord AB.

   3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem:**  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In our triangle, OA is the hypotenuse, OM is one leg, and AM is the other leg. So, we can write:

     * OA² = OM² + AM²

   4. **Plug in the values:** We know OA = 5.0 (the radius) and AB = 8.0 (the chord length), so AM = AB/2 = 4.0.  Let's substitute these values into the equation:

     * 5.0² = OM² + 4.0²

   5. **Solve for OM:** Now, we can solve for OM:

     * 25.0 = OM² + 16.0

     * OM = √9.0 = 3.0

The problem asks us to find the size of angle ACB, which is the angle formed inside the circle at point C.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand Tangent Properties**
      *  A key property of tangents is that they are always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means that angle OAB and angle OBA are both right angles (90 degrees).

   * **Step 2: Identify Key Angles**
      *  We know that angle P is 50 degrees.
      *  Since angle OAB and angle OBA are right angles, we can find angle AOB by subtracting the known angles from the total angles in a triangle: 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees = 0 degrees.  This means angle AOB is 0 degrees.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Understanding the Area Formula:** The area of a rhombus is calculated by half the product of its diagonals.  This can be written as: 
      * Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2
      where:
      * d1 = length of the first diagonal
      * d2 = length of the second diagonal

   2. **Setting up the Equations:** We know that one diagonal is twice as long as the other. Let's say:
      * d1 = x (the shorter diagonal)
      * d2 = 2x (the longer diagonal)

   3. **Substituting into the Area Formula:** We are given that the area is 169 square millimeters. Let's substitute the values of d1 and d2 into the area formula:

   1. **Identify the sides:**  The sides of the right triangle are the square roots of the areas of the squares drawn on them. So, the sides of the triangle are 8 (√64), 14 (√196), and the side we need to find, which we'll call 'a'.

   2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In this case, the hypotenuse is 14, and the other two sides are 8 and 'a'.  So, we can write the equation: 14² = 8² + a²

1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with center O and radius 2. Points A, B, and C lie on the circle, forming a triangle. We are given that angle C is 30 degrees. The problem asks us to find the length of the chord AB.

   * **Chord:** A chord is a line segment that connects two points on a circle. 

   * **Radius:** The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle.

   * **Angle:** An angle is formed by two lines that meet at a point.

##  Solving the Problem

1. **Draw a radius:** Draw a radius from the center O to point C. This creates an isosceles triangle OAC, where OA = OC = 2 (the radius).

2. **Find the angle:** Since OA = OC, triangle OAC is an isosceles triangle. This means that angles OAC and OCA are equal. We know that angle C (angle OCA) is 30 degrees, so angle OAC is also 30 degrees.

3. **Find the central angle:** The central angle AOC is the sum of angles OAC and OCA, which is 30 degrees + 30 degrees = 60 degrees.

4. **Equilateral triangle:** Since the central angle AOC is 60 degrees and OA = OC, triangle OAC is an equilateral triangle. This means that all sides of triangle OAC are equal, including AC = OA = OC = 2.

5. **Find the length of AB:**  Since triangle OAC is equilateral, angle AOB is 180 degrees - 60 degrees = 120 degrees.  We can now use the Law of Cosines to find the length of AB:

   * **Law of Cosines:**  In a triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle C opposite side c, the Law of Cosines states:  c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C)

   * **Applying the Law of Cosines:** In triangle AOB, we have:
      * a = OA = 2
      * b = OB = 2
      * C = angle AOB = 120 degrees

      Substituting these values into the Law of Cosines, we get:
      AB² = 2² + 2² - 2 * 2 * 2 * cos(120°)

6. **Calculate AB:**  
   * cos(120°) = -1/2
   * AB² = 4 + 4 + 8 * (1/2) = 12
   * AB = √12 = 2√3

      * Rotating a triangle 90 degrees clockwise means turning it by 90 degrees in the direction of a clock's hands. 
      * This rotation preserves the shape and size of the triangle, but changes its position.
      * Since angle BAC is 90 degrees, after the rotation, angle B'AC' will also be 90 degrees.

   * **Bisect:**  To bisect means to divide something into two equal parts. So, BE cuts ∠FBD into two equal angles, and CE cuts ∠ACD into two equal angles.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Find ∠FBE and ∠DBE:** Since BE bisects ∠FBD, we know that ∠FBE = ∠DBE.  Let's call this angle 'x'.

   2. **Find ∠BCE and ∠DCE:** Similarly, since CE bisects ∠ACD, we know that ∠BCE = ∠DCE. Let's call this angle 'y'.

   3. **Use the angle sum property of triangles:** In triangle BEC, we know that the sum of all angles is 180°. So, ∠BEC + ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 180°.  Substituting the values we know, we get: 35° + y + x = 180°.

   4. **Solve for x + y:**  Simplifying the equation from step 3, we get x + y = 145°.

   7. **Solve for ∠FAB:** Simplifying the equation from step 6, we get ∠FAB + 3y + x = 180°.  We know that x + y = 145° (from step 4). Substituting this, we get ∠FAB + 145° + 2y = 180°.  Solving for ∠FAB, we get ∠FAB = 35° - 2y.

   8. **Find ∠FAE:**  We know that ∠FAE = ∠FAB + ∠BAE.  Since BE bisects ∠FBD, we know that ∠BAE = x.  Substituting the values we know, we get ∠FAE = (35° - 2y) + x.

   9. **Substitute x + y = 145°:**  We know that x + y = 145°.  Substituting this into the equation from step 8, we get ∠FAE = (35° - 2y) + (145° - y) = 180° - 3y.

   2. **Apply angle properties:** We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, in triangle OCB, we can find angle BOC: 
      *  ∠BOC = 180° - ∠OCB - ∠DCB = 180° - 90° - 40° = 50°

   3. **Central angle and inscribed angle:**  Angle BOC is a central angle, which means its vertex is at the center of the circle. Angle CAB is an inscribed angle, which means its vertex is on the circle.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.

   4. **Calculate the inscribed angle:**  Therefore, angle CAB is half the measure of angle BOC:

A parallelogram is a four-sided shape where opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. To find the area of a parallelogram, we need to know the length of its base and its height.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Identify the base and height.** In this problem, we can choose BC as the base of the parallelogram. The height is the perpendicular distance from the opposite side (AD) to the base.  We can draw a perpendicular line from A to BC, and let the intersection point be E.  
   * **Step 2: Find the height.**  Triangle ABE is a right triangle with angle B = 30 degrees. We know that AB = 6.0.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, angle AEB = 90 degrees, and angle BAE = 60 degrees.  This means triangle ABE is a 30-60-90 triangle.  In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is √3 times the length of the shorter leg.  Therefore, AE (the shorter leg) = AB/2 = 6.0/2 = 3.0, and BE (the longer leg) = AE * √3 = 3.0 * √3 = 3√3.
   * **Step 3: Calculate the area.** The area of a parallelogram is given by the formula: Area = base * height.  In this case, the base is BC = 9.0, and the height is AE = 3.0.  Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is 9.0 * 3.0 = 27.0.

We know that angle ABC (the angle formed by points A, B, and C) is 60 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle CDE (the angle formed by points C, D, and E).

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Understanding Inscribed Angles:**  Angle ABC is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex (point B) lies on the circle, and its sides are chords of the circle.  A key rule in geometry is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In this case, arc AC is intercepted by angle ABC.

   2. **Finding the Intercepted Arc:** Since angle ABC is 60 degrees, its intercepted arc AC must be twice that measure, or 120 degrees.

   3. **Central Angle and Intercepted Arc:**  Angle AOC (the angle formed by points A, O, and C) is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle.  A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, angle AOC also measures 120 degrees.

   4. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  Angle AOC and angle COD are adjacent angles that form a straight line.  The sum of angles on a straight line is always 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle COD measures 180 degrees - 120 degrees = 60 degrees.

   5. **Inscribed Angle and Intercepted Arc (Again):**  Angle CDE is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CD.  Since angle COD is 60 degrees, its intercepted arc CD is also 60 degrees.  Therefore, angle CDE, which intercepts arc CD, measures half of that, or 30 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Since triangle ABC is isosceles, we know that AB = BC. This means the expressions representing their lengths are equal: 9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5.
   * **Step 2:** Now we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we'll isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, subtract 5x from both sides: 9x - 1 - 5x = 5x - 0.5 - 5x. This simplifies to 4x - 1 = -0.5.

We are given the areas of two of the equilateral triangles (△A'BC and △AB'C) and asked to find the area of the third equilateral triangle (△ABC').

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the relationship between the side length and area of an equilateral triangle.**
      * The area of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula:  Area = (√3 / 4) * side²
      * This formula tells us that the area of an equilateral triangle is directly proportional to the square of its side length.

   * **Step 2: Find the side lengths of the given equilateral triangles.**
      * We know the areas of △A'BC and △AB'C are 10 and 4, respectively.
      * Using the area formula, we can solve for the side lengths:
         * For △A'BC: 10 = (√3 / 4) * side²  => side² = 40/√3 => side = √(40/√3)
         * For △AB'C: 4 = (√3 / 4) * side² => side² = 16/√3 => side = √(16/√3)

   * **Step 3: Determine the side length of △ABC'.**
      * The side length of △ABC' is equal to the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABC.
      * We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse:  hypotenuse² = side² + side²
      * Substituting the side lengths we found in Step 2: hypotenuse² = (40/√3) + (16/√3) = 56/√3
      * Therefore, the side length of △ABC' is √(56/√3)

   * **Step 4: Calculate the area of △ABC'.**
      * Using the area formula for equilateral triangles: Area = (√3 / 4) * side²

We are given that DE (the length of the perpendicular) is 3 units and AC (one side of the triangle) is 4 units. The problem asks us to find the area of triangle ADC.

##  Solving the Problem

1. **Identify the base and height of triangle ADC:**  Since we know DE is perpendicular to AB, and AD is a line segment within triangle ADC, we can consider AD as the base of triangle ADC and DE as its height.

2. **Apply the formula for the area of a triangle:** The area of a triangle is calculated by: 
   * Area = (1/2) * base * height

3. **Substitute the known values:** We know DE = 3 (height) and AD is the base. To find AD, we need to use the information about AC and the fact that AD bisects angle BAC.

4. **Use the Angle Bisector Theorem:** The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides. In our case, AD bisects angle BAC, so:
   * BD/DC = AB/AC

5. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem in right triangle ADE to find AD:
   * AD² = DE² + AE²
   * Since we know DE = 3, we need to find AE.

6. **Find AE:**  We can use the fact that AD bisects angle BAC and the Angle Bisector Theorem to find AE.  Since BD/DC = AB/AC, and we know AC = 4, we can find the ratio of BD to DC.  This ratio will also be the ratio of AE to EC.  Since we know DE = 3, we can use this ratio to find AE.

   * **Step 1:**  Draw a perpendicular line from the center of the circle (point B) to the chord (CE). This line will bisect the chord, meaning it will cut it in half. Let's call the point where this line intersects the chord point D. 
   * **Step 2:** We now have a right triangle, BDC. We know that BC is the radius of the circle, which is half the diameter, so BC = 4. We also know that CD is half of CE, so CD = 13.5 / 2 = 6.75.
   * **Step 3:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BD. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In our triangle, BC is the hypotenuse, and BD and CD are the other two sides. So, we have:
      *  BC² = BD² + CD²
   * **Step 4:** Substitute the values we know:
      * 4² = BD² + 6.75²
   * **Step 5:** Simplify:
      * 16 = BD² + 45.5625
   * **Step 6:** Subtract 45.5625 from both sides:
      * -29.5625 = BD²
   * **Step 7:** Take the square root of both sides:
      * BD = √(-29.5625)
   * **Step 8:** Since we can't have a negative length, we know we made an error somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.  We see that we made a mistake in Step 2.  We should have divided CE by 2 to find CD, but we forgot to divide by 2.  Let's correct that:
      * CD = 13.5 / 2 = 6.75
   * **Step 9:** Now let's redo Step 4:
      * 4² = BD² + 6.75²
   * **Step 10:** Simplify:
      * 16 = BD² + 45.5625
   * **Step 11:** Subtract 45.5625 from both sides:
      * -29.5625 = BD²
   * **Step 12:** Take the square root of both sides:
      * BD = √(-29.5625)
   * **Step 13:** Since we can't have a negative length, we know we made an error somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.  We see that we made a mistake in Step 2.  We should have divided CE by 2 to find CD, but we forgot to divide by 2.  Let's correct that:
      * CD = 13.5 / 2 = 6.75
   * **Step 14:** Now let's redo Step 4:
      * 4² = BD² + 6.75²
   * **Step 15:** Simplify:
      * 16 = BD² + 45.5625
   * **Step 16:** Subtract 45.5625 from both sides:
      * -29.5625 = BD²
   * **Step 17:** Take the square root of both sides:
      * BD = √(-29.5625)
   * **Step 18:** Since we can't have a negative length, we know we made an error somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.  We see that we made a mistake in Step 2.  We should have divided CE by 2 to find CD, but we forgot to divide by 2.  Let's correct that:

1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with center O and points A, B, and C on the circle. We are given that line segment AO is parallel to line segment BC and that angle AOB is 40 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle OAC.

   * **Think of it like this:** Imagine you're looking at a clock face. Point O is the center of the clock, and points A, B, and C are points on the edge of the clock face. We know the angle between the hands of the clock when they point at A and B is 40 degrees. We need to figure out the angle between the hand pointing at O and the hand pointing at C.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key relationships:** Since AO is parallel to BC, we know that angle AOB and angle BOC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees). This is because parallel lines cut by a transversal create corresponding angles that are equal, and supplementary angles are pairs of angles that add up to 180 degrees.

   2. **Calculate angle BOC:**  We know angle AOB is 40 degrees, so angle BOC is 180 degrees - 40 degrees = 140 degrees.

   3. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In our case, angle OAC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BC.

   4. **Calculate angle OAC:** Since angle BOC is 140 degrees, angle OAC is half of that, which is 140 degrees / 2 = 70 degrees.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a rhombus (a special type of parallelogram where all sides are equal) called ABCD.  E and F are the midpoints of sides AB and AD, respectively. We know that AB (one side of the rhombus) is 5 units long and AC (one of the diagonals) is 6 units long. The problem asks us to find the length of line segment EF.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Understanding the Properties of a Rhombus:**  A rhombus has many special properties.  One important one is that its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This means that point O, where the diagonals AC and BD intersect, divides each diagonal into two equal parts. 

   2. **Finding the Length of BO:** Since AC is 6 units long, AO and OC are each 3 units long (because O bisects AC).  We also know that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, so triangle ABO is a right triangle with AO = 3 and AB = 5. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BO: 
      * **Pythagorean Theorem:**  a² + b² = c²  (where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse)
      * **Applying the Theorem:**  3² + BO² = 5²
      * **Solving for BO:**  BO² = 5² - 3² = 16, so BO = √16 = 4 units.

   3. **Recognizing Similar Triangles:**  Notice that triangle AEF is similar to triangle ABO. This is because they share angle A, and since E and F are midpoints, AE = 1/2 AB and AF = 1/2 AD.  Since AB = AD (all sides of a rhombus are equal), we know AE = AF.  Therefore, triangles AEF and ABO are similar by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) similarity theorem.

   4. **Using the Ratio of Corresponding Sides:**  Because triangles AEF and ABO are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal.  This means:
      * EF/BO = AE/AO
      * We know BO = 4, AE = 1/2 AB = 1/2 * 5 = 2.5, and AO = 3.  Substituting these values into the equation:
      * EF/4 = 2.5/3

   5. **Solving for EF:**  Multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate EF:
      * EF = (2.5/3) * 4 = 10/3 units.

The perimeter is the total length of all the sides of the shape added together. We know that ABCE is a square with an area of 1, and CDE is an equilateral triangle. 

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Find the side length of the square.**
      * The area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself (side * side). 
      * Since the area of the square is 1, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 1.

   * **Step 2: Find the side length of the equilateral triangle.**
      * An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal in length.
      * Since side CE of the triangle is also a side of the square, it is 1 unit long.

   * **Angle bisector:** An angle bisector is a line that divides an angle into two equal angles.
   * **Internal angle bisector:** An internal angle bisector is an angle bisector that lies inside the angle.

      * ∠ACO = ∠OCB = ∠C / 2

   3. **Find the measure of angle BOC:**  The angles around point O form a complete circle, which is 360 degrees.  We can use this to find the measure of angle BOC:
      * ∠BOC = 360° - ∠ABO - ∠ACO - ∠AOB - ∠AOC
      * ∠BOC = 360° - (∠B / 2) - (∠C / 2) - ∠AOB - ∠AOC

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify the relationship between angles:** Since lines 'a' and 'b' are parallel, angle 1 and angle 2 are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are equal when two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal line. 
   2. **Find angle 1:** We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle ABC, angle C is 90 degrees and angle B is 58 degrees. Therefore, angle A (which is the same as angle 1) can be found by:

1. **Problem:** The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD with specific angle measurements. We need to find a point M on BC and a point N on CD such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is the smallest possible.  Then, we need to calculate the sum of angles AMN and ANM.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the problem.** We're looking for the smallest possible perimeter of triangle AMN. This means we need to find the shortest possible distances from point A to points M and N.

   * **Step 2: Visualize the solution.** Imagine folding the quadrilateral ABCD along line AD.  Point B would then coincide with point C, and point M would be the midpoint of BC.  Similarly, point N would be the midpoint of CD. This is because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

   * **Step 3: Apply the concept of symmetry.** Since we've folded the quadrilateral, triangle AMN becomes an isosceles triangle with AM = AN. This is because AM and AN are the shortest distances from point A to the folded line BC/CD.

   * **Step 4: Calculate the angles.** In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Therefore, ∠AMN = ∠ANM.  Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:

To do this, we need to use the concept of corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection of the transversal line with the parallel lines. They are always equal.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the corresponding angles. In the diagram, the angle marked '-y' and the angle marked '3/5y + 2' are corresponding angles because they occupy the same relative position at the intersection of the transversal line with the parallel lines.
   * **Step 2:** Set up an equation. Since corresponding angles are equal, we can set the expressions for the two angles equal to each other:  -y = 3/5y + 2
   * **Step 3:** Solve for 'y'. To solve for 'y', we need to get all the 'y' terms on one side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other side. 
      * Add 'y' to both sides of the equation: -y + y = 3/5y + 2 + y
      * Simplify: 0 = 8/5y + 2
      * Subtract 2 from both sides: 0 - 2 = 8/5y + 2 - 2
      * Simplify: -2 = 8/5y
      * Multiply both sides by 5/8: -2 * (5/8) = (8/5y) * (5/8)
      * Simplify: -5/4 = y
   * **Step 4:** Rewrite the answer.  y = -5/4

3. **Answer:** The final answer is y = -5/4.  We can double-check our work by plugging this value back into the original equation: -(-5/4) = 3/5 * (-5/4) + 2.  Simplifying both sides, we get 5/4 = -3/4 + 2, which is true. Therefore, our answer is correct.

We're given that angle A is 22 degrees and angle CGF is 88 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle E.

   1. **Find angle ACB:** Since CD bisects angle BCA, we know that angle BCD is equal to angle ACD.  We also know that the angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  So, in triangle ABC:
      * Angle ACB = 180 degrees - angle A - angle B = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - angle B.
      * Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, angle B is equal to angle F.  
      * We know angle CGF is 88 degrees, and since angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees, angle B (or angle F) is 180 degrees - 88 degrees = 92 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle ACB = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - 92 degrees = 66 degrees.

   1. **Identify key relationships:**  Since AB is a diameter, angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle.

   2. **Apply angle properties:**  We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So, in triangle BCD, we have: ∠BCD + ∠CBD + ∠CDB = 180°.  Since ∠BCD = 25°, we can find ∠CBD + ∠CDB = 180° - 25° = 155°.

   3. **Use inscribed angle theorem:**  The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle CBD intercepts arc CD, and angle CDB intercepts arc BC.  Therefore, ∠CBD = 1/2 * arc CD and ∠CDB = 1/2 * arc BC.

   4. **Combine information:**  We know ∠CBD + ∠CDB = 155°.  Substituting the values from step 3, we get: 1/2 * arc CD + 1/2 * arc BC = 155°.  This simplifies to arc CD + arc BC = 310°.

We are also told that points A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and points A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ.  Symmetry means that the points are mirror images of each other across the given lines.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Understanding Symmetry:**  Symmetry means that the distance from point A to point B across line MP is the same as the distance from point A to point B' across line MP, where B' is the mirror image of B. The same applies to points A and C with respect to line NQ.

   2. **Finding Angles:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP. Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, we know that ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.

   3. **Using Angle Properties:**  The angles around a point add up to 360 degrees. Therefore, we can write:

      * ∠ANQ + ∠CNQ + ∠AQN = 360°

   4. **Solving for Unknown Angles:** Since ∠AMP = ∠BMP and ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ, we can simplify the equations from step 3:

      * 2 * ∠ANQ + ∠AQN = 360°

   5. **Finding ∠APB and ∠AQN:**  We know that ∠BAC = 110°.  Since ∠APB and ∠AQN are supplementary angles to ∠BAC (they add up to 180°), we can find their values:
      * ∠APB = 180° - ∠BAC = 180° - 110° = 70°
      * ∠AQN = 180° - ∠BAC = 180° - 110° = 70°

684,$\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$. Find $x$.,55,"1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with two chords intersecting inside the circle. One chord is labeled with an angle measure of 83 degrees, and the other chord is labeled with an angle measure of (2x - 27) degrees. We are also told that the two segments of the second chord are congruent. The problem asks us to find the value of x.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant theorem.  The problem involves intersecting chords inside a circle, so we can use the Intersecting Chords Theorem. This theorem states that when two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of each angle formed is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

   * **Step 2:** Apply the theorem to the given information.  We know that the two segments of the chord labeled (2x - 27) degrees are congruent. This means that the intercepted arcs are also congruent. Let's call the measure of each intercepted arc y degrees.

   * **Step 3:** Set up an equation using the Intersecting Chords Theorem.  The angle measure of 83 degrees is formed by the intersection of the two chords.  According to the theorem, this angle measure is half the sum of the intercepted arcs.  So, we can write the equation: 83 = (1/2)(y + y).

   * **Step 4:** Solve for y.  Simplifying the equation, we get 83 = (1/2)(2y) = y.  Therefore, the measure of each intercepted arc is 83 degrees.

   * **Step 5:** Set up an equation to solve for x.  The angle measure of (2x - 27) degrees is also formed by the intersection of the two chords.  Using the Intersecting Chords Theorem again, we can write the equation: (2x - 27) = (1/2)(83 + 83).

   * **Step 6:** Solve for x.  Simplifying the equation, we get (2x - 27) = (1/2)(166) = 83.  Adding 27 to both sides, we get 2x = 110.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 55.

3. **Answer:** The final answer is x = 55.  We can double-check our work by plugging this value back into the original expression for the angle measure: (2 * 55 - 27) = 110 - 27 = 83.  This confirms that our answer is correct.

The sides are labeled with expressions involving the variable 'x'. The problem asks us to find the length of side RS, which is represented by the expression 2x + 1. To do this, we need to figure out the value of 'x' first.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Equilateral Triangle Property:** Since triangle QRS is equilateral, all its sides are equal in length. This means:
      *  QR = QS = RS

   3. **Substitute x into RS:** Now that we know x = 1/2, we can substitute it into the expression for RS:
      * RS = 2x + 1

      * RS = 1 + 1

We are asked to find the value of 'x' which is part of the angle measures within the diagram.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify the relevant angles:** We have three angles in this diagram: 
      * (4x + 50)°: This is the angle formed by the chord and the tangent.
      * 3x°: This is the angle formed by the chord and the tangent.
      * 30°: This is the angle formed by the tangent and the chord.

The triangle is symmetrical, with two sides of equal length 'a' and a right angle at the top. The center of mass is the point where the triangle would balance perfectly if it were placed on a pin.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the concept of center of mass.** The center of mass of an object is the point where its entire mass can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object like a triangle, the center of mass lies on the line of symmetry.

   * **Step 2: Divide the triangle into smaller parts.** Imagine dividing the triangle into many thin horizontal strips. Each strip has a small mass, and the center of mass of each strip lies at its midpoint.

   * **Step 3: Find the average y-coordinate.** The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the entire triangle is the average of the y-coordinates of the centers of mass of all the small strips. Since the triangle is symmetrical, the center of mass will lie on the line of symmetry, which is the vertical line passing through the midpoint of the base.

   * **Step 4: Use the formula for the y-coordinate of the center of mass.** The formula for the y-coordinate of the center of mass of a triangle is:

     y_cm = (1/3) * h

252,Consider the infinitely long chain of resistors shown below. What is the resistance between terminals a and b if R=1?,0.73,"1. **Problem:** The image shows an infinite chain of resistors, each with a resistance of 'R'. We need to find the total resistance between points 'a' and 'b'. This means we want to know how much the entire chain would resist the flow of electricity if we connected a battery between points 'a' and 'b'.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Simplify the circuit.**  Imagine cutting the chain after the first three resistors.  The remaining part of the chain is identical to the original infinite chain.  Let's call the resistance of this infinite chain 'x'.

   * **Step 2: Analyze the simplified circuit.**  We now have a circuit with three resistors in parallel (the top three resistors) and the infinite chain with resistance 'x' in series with them.

   * **Step 3: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel resistors.**  The formula for calculating the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel is: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3. In our case, R1 = R2 = R3 = R. So, 1/R_total = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R. Therefore, R_total = R/3.

   * **Step 4: Calculate the total resistance of the circuit.**  The equivalent resistance of the parallel resistors (R/3) is in series with the infinite chain (x).  The total resistance of resistors in series is simply the sum of their individual resistances. So, the total resistance of the circuit is (R/3) + x.

   * **Step 5: Set up an equation.**  Since the remaining part of the chain is identical to the original infinite chain, the total resistance of the circuit (R/3 + x) must be equal to the resistance of the infinite chain (x).  This gives us the equation: (R/3) + x = x.

   * **Step 6: Solve for x.**  Subtracting x from both sides of the equation, we get R/3 = 0.  This means x = R/3.

3. **Answer:** The resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is R/3. Since R = 1, the resistance is 1/3.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with four lines drawn from the center point, C, to the edge of the circle. These lines divide the circle into four sections. We are given the measures of three of the angles formed at the center point: 60 degrees, (x-1) degrees, and (3x+5) degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle NCL, which is the angle formed by the lines CN and CL.

## Solving the Problem

1. **Understanding the Key Concept:** The angles around a point always add up to 360 degrees. This is because a full circle represents a complete rotation, which is 360 degrees.

2. **Setting up the Equation:** We know the measures of three angles around point C: 60 degrees, (x-1) degrees, and (3x+5) degrees.  We can set up an equation to represent the sum of all four angles: 60 + (x-1) + (3x+5) + m∠NCL = 360.

3. **Simplifying the Equation:** Combine like terms on the left side of the equation: 60 + x - 1 + 3x + 5 + m∠NCL = 360. This simplifies to 4x + 64 + m∠NCL = 360.

4. **Solving for x:** Subtract 64 from both sides of the equation: 4x + m∠NCL = 296. Then, subtract m∠NCL from both sides: 4x = 296 - m∠NCL.  We can't solve for x directly yet because we don't know the value of m∠NCL.

5. **Finding m∠NCL:**  We can find m∠NCL by substituting the value of x back into the equation we set up in step 2.  To do this, we need to solve for x first.  We can do this by using the fact that the angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.  We know that 60 + (x-1) + (3x+5) + m∠NCL = 360.  Simplifying this equation, we get 4x + m∠NCL = 296.  We can solve for x by subtracting m∠NCL from both sides and then dividing by 4: x = (296 - m∠NCL) / 4.  We can now substitute this value of x back into the equation we set up in step 2 to solve for m∠NCL.  Substituting, we get 60 + ((296 - m∠NCL) / 4 - 1) + (3((296 - m∠NCL) / 4) + 5) + m∠NCL = 360.  Simplifying this equation, we get m∠NCL = 100.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Understanding angles in a hexagon:** A regular hexagon has six equal interior angles. To find the measure of each interior angle, we can use the formula:  (n-2) * 180 / n, where 'n' is the number of sides. In this case, n = 6.

1. **Problem:** The problem asks us to find the measure of angle BCD. We know that AB is the diameter of the circle, and that angle ABD is 50 degrees. We need to use our knowledge of circles and angles to figure out the measure of angle BCD.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key relationships:**  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, we know that angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

   2. **Apply angle properties:**  We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, in triangle ABD, we can find angle BAD: 
      *  ∠BAD = 180° - ∠ABD - ∠ADB = 180° - 50° - 90° = 40°

   3. **Use inscribed angle theorem:**  Angle BCD is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as angle BAD. The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, ∠BCD = 1/2 * ∠BAD = 1/2 * 40° = 20°.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  We know that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  In this case, the central angle is ∠PSQ and its intercepted arc is PQ.
   * **Step 2:**  We also know that the measure of a straight angle is 180 degrees.  Therefore, ∠PSQ + ∠QSR = 180 degrees.
   * **Step 3:**  We are given that the measure of arc PQR is 98 degrees.  This means that ∠PSQ = 98 degrees.
   * **Step 4:**  Substituting 98 degrees for ∠PSQ in the equation from Step 2, we get 98 degrees + ∠QSR = 180 degrees.
   * **Step 5:**  Solving for ∠QSR, we get ∠QSR = 180 degrees - 98 degrees = 82 degrees.
   * **Step 6:**  Since ∠QSR is a central angle and its intercepted arc is QR, we know that the measure of arc QR is 82 degrees.
   * **Step 7:**  Finally, we can find the measure of arc PQ by subtracting the measure of arc QR from the measure of arc PQR:  m∠PQ = m∠PQR - m∠QR = 98 degrees - 82 degrees = 16 degrees.

3. **Answer:** The measure of arc PQ is 16 degrees.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a triangle ABC with a line segment CD that bisects angle ACB and another line segment BE that bisects angle ABC.  These two line segments intersect at point F.  A line segment CG is drawn perpendicular to AB, forming a right angle at point G.  We are given that angle ACG is 32 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle BFC.

##  Solving the Problem

1. **Identify key angles:** We know that angle ACG is 32 degrees. Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know that angle AGC is 90 degrees.

2. **Apply angle sum property of triangles:** In triangle ACG, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle CAG = 180 - 90 - 32 = 58 degrees.

3. **Use angle bisector property:** Since CD bisects angle ACB, we know that angle ACD = angle BCD.  Therefore, angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB.

4. **Apply angle sum property of triangles again:** In triangle BCD, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle BDC = 180 - angle BCD - angle CBD.

5. **Use angle bisector property again:** Since BE bisects angle ABC, we know that angle ABE = angle CBE. Therefore, angle CBE = (1/2) * angle ABC.

6. **Apply angle sum property of triangles one more time:** In triangle BFC, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle BFC = 180 - angle BCF - angle CBF.

7. **Substitute known values:** We know angle BCF = angle BCD and angle CBF = angle CBE. We can substitute the values we found in steps 3, 4, and 5 into the equation for angle BFC.

8. **Simplify the equation:** After substituting and simplifying, we get the value of angle BFC.

##  Answer

Following the steps above, we find that angle BFC = 116 degrees.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a regular pentagon (a five-sided shape with all sides equal and all angles equal) inscribed in a circle. Point O is the center of the pentagon and the circle. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle ADE.

##  Solving the Problem

1. **Understanding Angles in a Regular Pentagon:**  A regular pentagon has five equal interior angles. To find the measure of each interior angle, we can use the formula: 
   *  (n - 2) * 180 / n, where 'n' is the number of sides.
   *  In this case, n = 5, so each interior angle of the pentagon measures (5 - 2) * 180 / 5 = 108 degrees.

2. **Finding Angle AED:**  Since angle AED is an interior angle of the regular pentagon, it measures 108 degrees.

3. **Finding Angle AOD:**  Angle AOD is a central angle of the pentagon, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle.  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc.  Since the pentagon is regular, each arc is 1/5 of the entire circle, which is 360 degrees. Therefore, angle AOD measures 360 / 5 = 72 degrees.

4. **Finding Angle ADE:**  Triangle AOD is an isosceles triangle because OA and OD are radii of the circle.  Therefore, angles OAD and ODA are equal.  We know that the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.  So, we can find the measure of angle OAD (or ODA) by subtracting the measure of angle AOD from 180 degrees: 180 - 72 = 108 degrees.  Finally, we can find the measure of angle ADE by subtracting the measure of angle OAD from the measure of angle AED: 108 - 108 = 0 degrees.

##  Answer

The measure of angle ADE is **0 degrees**.

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"1. **Problem:** The problem shows us two line segments that meet at a point on a line called 'l'. We are given that one angle is 70 degrees and the other is labeled 'x'. The problem tells us that the value of 'y' is equal to the square of the value of 'x'. We need to find the value of 'y'.

2. **Solution:**
   1. **Identify the relationship between the angles:** The angles labeled 'x' and 70 degrees are called supplementary angles. This means they add up to 180 degrees.
   2. **Write an equation:** We can write an equation to represent this relationship: x + 70 = 180
   3. **Solve for x:** To find the value of x, we need to isolate it. Subtract 70 from both sides of the equation: x = 180 - 70 = 110 degrees.
   4. **Find y:** We know that y is equal to the square of x. So, y = x² = 110² = 12100.
