643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem:

As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ().

## Solution:

1. **Identify key relationships:**
    * **Diameter and Circle:**  CD is the diameter of the circle, meaning it passes through the center of the circle (O) and divides the circle into two equal halves.
    * **Parallel Lines:** DE is parallel to OA (DE ∥ OA). This means that the angles formed by these lines with the diameter CD are equal.

2. **Apply Angle Properties:**
    * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle (an angle formed by two chords with its vertex on the circle) is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Since ∠D is an inscribed angle intercepting arc CE, we can say: ∠D = 1/2 * arc CE.
    * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle (an angle formed by two radii with its vertex at the center of the circle) is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Since ∠COD is a central angle intercepting arc CE, we can say: ∠COD = arc CE.

3. **Calculate the measure of arc CE:**
    * We know ∠D = 50°. Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we can find the measure of arc CE: 
        * ∠D = 1/2 * arc CE
        * 50° = 1/2 * arc CE
        * arc CE = 50° * 2 = 100°

4. **Calculate the measure of ∠COD:**
    * Using the Central Angle Theorem, we know that ∠COD is equal to the measure of arc CE:
        * ∠COD = arc CE = 100°

5. **Calculate the measure of ∠C:**
    * Since DE ∥ OA, we know that ∠C and ∠COD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°).
    * Therefore: ∠C = 180° - ∠COD = 180° - 100° = 80°

## Answer:

The degree of ∠C is **80°**.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## Problem: 
Find the length of the hypotenuse, *h*, of a right triangle with one leg of length 4 and an angle of 60 degrees.

## Solution:
1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We have the length of the adjacent side (4) and we want to find the hypotenuse (*h*). The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is the cosine: 
    * **cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse**

2. **Apply the cosine ratio:** In this case, the angle is 60 degrees. So, we can write:
    * **cos(60°) = 4 / *h***

3. **Solve for *h*:** To isolate *h*, we can multiply both sides of the equation by *h* and then divide both sides by cos(60°):
    * ***h* * cos(60°) = 4**
    * ***h* = 4 / cos(60°)**

4. **Calculate the value of cos(60°):**  The cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2. 

5. **Substitute and solve:** Now we can substitute the value of cos(60°) into the equation:
    * ***h* = 4 / (1/2)**
    * ***h* = 4 * 2**
    * ***h* = 8**

## Answer:
The length of the hypotenuse, *h*, is 8.

△ABC is inscribed in a circle with center O. Given that ∠ABC = 70°, find the measure of ∠AOC.

## Solution:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  We can use the **Inscribed Angle Theorem** to solve this problem. This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Apply the theorem to ∠ABC:**  ∠ABC intercepts arc AC. Therefore, according to the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
    * m∠ABC = (1/2) * m(arc AC)
    * 70° = (1/2) * m(arc AC)
    * m(arc AC) = 70° * 2 = 140°

3. **Relate ∠AOC to arc AC:** ∠AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc AC as ∠ABC.

4. **Apply the Central Angle Theorem:** The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

5. **Calculate ∠AOC:** Since ∠AOC intercepts arc AC, we have:

The problem asks for the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3, given the following information:

* Charges: 
    * q1 = -q2 = 100 nC
    * q3 = -q4 = 200 nC
* Distance: a = 5.0 cm

## Solution:

To find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3, we need to consider the forces exerted by each of the other particles on particle 3 and then sum up their x-components.

**Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**

Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to particles 1, 2, and 4.

* **Force due to particle 1 (F13):** This force is attractive because q1 and q3 have opposite signs. It acts along the diagonal of the square.
* **Force due to particle 2 (F23):** This force is repulsive because q2 and q3 have the same sign. It acts horizontally to the right.
* **Force due to particle 4 (F43):** This force is attractive because q4 and q3 have opposite signs. It acts vertically downwards.

**Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of each force using Coulomb's Law.**

Coulomb's Law states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

* **Formula:** F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
    * F: Magnitude of the electrostatic force
    * k: Coulomb's constant (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
    * q1, q2: Magnitudes of the charges
    * r: Distance between the charges

* **F13:**
    * q1 = 100 nC = 100 × 10^-9 C
    * q3 = 200 nC = 200 × 10^-9 C
    * r = √(a^2 + a^2) = a√2 = 5√2 cm = 5√2 × 10^-2 m
    * F13 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (5√2 × 10^-2 m)^2 ≈ 0.036 N

* **F23:**
    * q2 = 100 nC = 100 × 10^-9 C
    * q3 = 200 nC = 200 × 10^-9 C
    * r = a = 5 cm = 5 × 10^-2 m
    * F23 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (5 × 10^-2 m)^2 ≈ 0.072 N

* **F43:**
    * q4 = 200 nC = 200 × 10^-9 C
    * q3 = 200 nC = 200 × 10^-9 C
    * r = a = 5 cm = 5 × 10^-2 m
    * F43 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (200 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (5 × 10^-2 m)^2 ≈ 0.144 N

**Step 3: Determine the x-component of each force.**

* **F13:** The x-component of F13 is F13 * cos(45°) ≈ 0.036 N * 0.707 ≈ 0.025 N
* **F23:** The x-component of F23 is F23 = 0.072 N (since it acts horizontally)

        * We can see that triangle $JQP$ is a right triangle with right angle at $P$.
    * **Step 3:** Apply the Pythagorean theorem.

        * The inradius of a triangle is equal to the area of the triangle divided by its semiperimeter.
        * We need to find the area of triangle $JLN$ and its semiperimeter.
    * **Step 5:** Find the area of triangle $JLN$.
        * We can use the formula for the area of a triangle: Area = (1/2) * base * height.
        * We can use $JL$ as the base and $QM$ as the height.
        * Area of triangle $JLN = (1/2) * 16.5 * 9 = 74.25$

In triangle ABC, the perpendicular bisector of AB intersects AB at point D and BC at point E. AE is connected. If AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, what is the perimeter of triangle ABC?

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the problem:** We are given a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of AB. We know the length of AB and the perimeter of triangle ACE. We need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

2. **Key property of perpendicular bisectors:** A perpendicular bisector of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts. Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

3. **Using the perimeter information:** The perimeter of triangle ACE is the sum of its sides: AC + CE + AE = 13.

4. **Finding AC:** Since AD is half of AB, and AE is a side of triangle ACE, we can find AC by subtracting AD from AE: AC = AE - AD.

5. **Finding BC:**  We know that CE is a side of triangle ACE and DE is a side of triangle BDE. Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that BE = DE. Therefore, BC = BE + CE = DE + CE.

6. **Calculating the perimeter of triangle ABC:** The perimeter of triangle ABC is the sum of its sides: AB + BC + AC. We can substitute the values we found in steps 4 and 5: AB + BC + AC = 6 + (DE + CE) + (AE - AD) = 6 + DE + CE + AE - AD.

7. **Simplifying the expression:** Since DE = BE and AD = DB, we can simplify the expression: 6 + DE + CE + AE - AD = 6 + BE + CE + AE - DB = 6 + BC + AE - DB.

8. **Final calculation:** We know that AB = 6, BC = BE + CE, and AE - DB = AC. Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC is 6 + BC + AC = 6 + (BE + CE) + (AE - AD) = 6 + BC + AE - AD = 6 + BC + AC = 6 + 13 = 19.

In parallelogram ABCD, the angle bisector of ∠ABC intersects AD at point E, and the angle bisector of ∠BCD intersects AD at point F. If AB = 3 and AD = 4, find the length of EF.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Properties of Parallelograms:**
    * **Opposite sides are equal:** AB = CD and AD = BC.
    * **Opposite angles are equal:** ∠ABC = ∠ADC and ∠BAD = ∠BCD.
    * **Consecutive angles are supplementary:** ∠ABC + ∠BAD = 180°.

2. **Using Angle Bisectors:**
    * Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE.
    * Similarly, since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, we have ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

3. **Identifying Similar Triangles:**
    * Notice that triangles ABE and CDE share ∠AED and have ∠ABE = ∠CDE (since ∠ABC = ∠ADC). Therefore, triangles ABE and CDE are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion.
    * Similarly, triangles BCF and ADF are similar by the AA similarity criterion.

4. **Using Proportions in Similar Triangles:**
    * Since triangles ABE and CDE are similar, we have the proportion: AE/DE = AB/CD.
    * Since AB = CD, we get AE = DE.
    * Similarly, from the similarity of triangles BCF and ADF, we get BF = CF.

5. **Finding EF:**
    * Since AE = DE and BF = CF, we have EF = (AE + DE) + (BF + CF) = 2AE + 2BF = 2(AE + BF).
    * Since AD = 4, we have AE + BF = AD/2 = 2.

One diagonal of a rhombus is twice as long as the other diagonal. If the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters, what are the lengths of the diagonals?

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Properties of a Rhombus:** A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length. Its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This means they divide the rhombus into four congruent right-angled triangles.

2. **Relating Diagonals to Area:** The area of a rhombus is half the product of its diagonals. We can express this mathematically as: 
    * Area of Rhombus = (1/2) * (Diagonal 1) * (Diagonal 2)

3. **Setting up the Equations:** Let's denote the shorter diagonal as 'd'. Since the longer diagonal is twice the length of the shorter diagonal, it can be represented as '2d'.

The image shows a right triangle with sides of length 8, 14, and an unknown side.  Squares are drawn on each side of the triangle, with the squares corresponding to the sides of length 8 and 14 having areas of 64 and 196, respectively. We need to find the area of the square labeled ""A"" on the unknown side of the triangle.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between the sides of a right triangle and the areas of the squares built on those sides. This relationship is known as the Pythagorean Theorem.

2. **Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  Mathematically, this is represented as:  a² + b² = c² where 'c' is the hypotenuse and 'a' and 'b' are the other two sides.

3. **Applying the Theorem:** In our problem, we know the areas of the squares built on two sides of the triangle.  The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of its side. Therefore, the sides of the squares are the square roots of their areas:
    * Side corresponding to area 64: √64 = 8
    * Side corresponding to area 196: √196 = 14

    * 64 + 196 = c²
    * 260 = c²
    * c = √260

5. **Calculating the Area of Square A:**  The area of square A is found by squaring the length of its side, which is the unknown side of the triangle (c):
    * Area of A = c² = (√260)² = 260

The image shows a circle with center O and radius 2. Points A, B, and C lie on the circle. Angle C is 30 degrees. We need to find the length of chord AB.

## Solution:

1. **Draw a radius from O to point C.** This creates an isosceles triangle OAC, where OA = OC = 2 (radius of the circle).

2. **Since angle C is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles in triangle OAC.**  The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Since OA = OC, triangle OAC is isosceles, and angles OAC and OCA are equal. Therefore:
    * Angle OAC = Angle OCA = (180 - 30) / 2 = 75 degrees.

3. **Focus on triangle OAB.**  Angle AOB is the central angle subtended by chord AB.  Since angle AOC is 75 degrees, and angle BOC is 30 degrees, angle AOB = 75 + 30 = 105 degrees.

4. **Apply the Law of Cosines to triangle OAB to find the length of AB.** The Law of Cosines states:
    * c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C)
    * Where c is the side opposite angle C, and a and b are the other two sides.

    * In our case:
        * c = AB (the side we want to find)
        * a = OA = 2 (radius)
        * b = OB = 2 (radius)
        * C = angle AOB = 105 degrees

    * Substituting these values into the Law of Cosines:
        * AB² = 2² + 2² - 2 * 2 * 2 * cos(105°)

5. **Calculate the value of AB.** Using a calculator, we find:
    * AB² = 8 - 8 * cos(105°) ≈ 11.46
    * AB ≈ √11.46 ≈ 3.39

3. **Applying Angle Properties:**  The angles within a triangle always add up to 180°.  Therefore, in triangle B'C'C:
    * ∠B'C'C + ∠CC'B' + ∠CB'C' = 180°
    * ∠B'C'C + 32° + 90° = 180°

    * A bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. 
    * Since BE bisects angle FBD, we know that angle FBE = angle EBD.
    * Similarly, since CE bisects angle ACD, we know that angle ACE = angle ECD.

2. **Finding Angle BEC:**

        * angle FBE = angle EBD = (1/2) * angle FBD
    * We also know that angle ABE + angle EBD = angle FBD.
    * Therefore, angle ABE = (1/2) * angle FBD.

    * Substituting the values we know: angle FAE + (angle ACE - 35 degrees) = angle ABE.
    * Since angle ABE = angle EBD and angle ACE = angle ECD, we can simplify the equation to: angle FAE + (angle ECD - 35 degrees) = angle EBD.

The problem involves a right triangle ABC with a right angle at A. Three equilateral triangles are constructed outwards on the sides of the triangle: A'BC, AB'C, and ABC'. The areas of triangles A'BC and AB'C are given as 10 and 4 respectively. We need to find the area of triangle ABC'.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Relationship between Areas and Sides:**
    * The area of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula: Area = (√3/4) * side²
    * This means the area of an equilateral triangle is directly proportional to the square of its side length.

2. **Finding the Side Lengths of the Equilateral Triangles:**
    * For triangle A'BC, we know the area is 10. Let the side length of this triangle be 'a'.
    * Using the area formula: 10 = (√3/4) * a²
    * Solving for 'a': a² = (40/√3) => a = √(40/√3)
    * Similarly, for triangle AB'C with an area of 4, let the side length be 'b'.
    * Using the area formula: 4 = (√3/4) * b²
    * Solving for 'b': b² = (16/√3) => b = √(16/√3)

3. **Relating the Side Lengths to the Sides of the Right Triangle:**
    * Notice that the side lengths 'a' and 'b' of the equilateral triangles are also the hypotenuses of the right triangles A'BA and B'CB respectively.
    * The sides of the right triangle ABC are the legs of these smaller right triangles.

4. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**
    * In right triangle A'BA, we have: a² = AB² + A'A²
    * In right triangle B'CB, we have: b² = BC² + B'B²
    * Since A'A = AB and B'B = BC (sides of the equilateral triangles), we can simplify these equations:
        * a² = 2 * AB²
        * b² = 2 * BC²

5. **Finding the Area of Triangle ABC':**
    * Let the side length of triangle ABC' be 'c'.
    * Using the area formula: Area of ABC' = (√3/4) * c²
    * We know c = AC, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABC.
    * Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABC: AC² = AB² + BC²
    * Substituting the values from step 4: c² = (a²/2) + (b²/2)
    * Therefore, the area of triangle ABC' = (√3/4) * [(a²/2) + (b²/2)]

6. **Calculating the Area:**
    * Substitute the values of 'a' and 'b' calculated in step 2:
    * Area of ABC' = (√3/4) * [(40/√3)/2 + (16/√3)/2]
    * Simplifying: Area of ABC' = (√3/4) * (28/√3) = 7

## Solution:

1. **Identify key relationships:**
    * **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle:**  ∠AOF is a central angle, and ∠F is an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc AF.  The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.
    * **Diameter and Inscribed Angle:**  Since AB is a diameter, ∠AEB is an inscribed angle subtended by the diameter, making it a right angle (90°).
    * **Midpoint and Angle Bisector:**  Point E is the midpoint of FEB, making OE an angle bisector of ∠FEB.

2. **Calculate ∠F:**
    * **Using the central angle and inscribed angle relationship:** ∠F = 1/2 * ∠AOF = 1/2 * 40° = 20°.

3. **Calculate ∠FEB:**
    * **Using the diameter and inscribed angle relationship:** ∠AEB = 90°.
    * **Since ∠AEB is a right angle and ∠F = 20°, we can find ∠FEB:** ∠FEB = ∠AEB - ∠F = 90° - 20° = 70°.

## Solution:

1. **Identify key relationships:**
    * **Diameter and Chord:**  The diameter of a circle bisects a chord if and only if it passes through the midpoint of the chord. In this case, CD is the diameter and G is the midpoint of EF, so CD bisects EF.
    * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc. ∠DCF is an inscribed angle intercepting arc DF.
    * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. ∠EOD is a central angle intercepting arc DF.

2. **Find the measure of arc DF:**
    * Since ∠DCF intercepts arc DF, and by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, ∠DCF = 1/2 * arc DF.
    * Therefore, arc DF = 2 * ∠DCF = 2 * 20.0° = 40.0°.

In the figure above, CDE is an equilateral triangle and ABCE is a square with an area of 1. What is the perimeter of polygon ABCDE?

## Solution:

1. **Find the side length of the square:** 
    * The area of a square is calculated by squaring the side length: Area = side²
    * We know the area of the square is 1, so: 1 = side²
    * To find the side length, we take the square root of both sides: √1 = √(side²)
    * Therefore, the side length of the square is 1.

2. **Find the side length of the equilateral triangle:**
    * Since ABCE is a square, all sides are equal, so BC = 1.
    * In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so CD = DE = CE = BC = 1.

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the polygon:**
    * The perimeter of a polygon is the total length of all its sides.
    * Perimeter of ABCDE = AB + BC + CD + DE + EA
    * Perimeter of ABCDE = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle BOC in triangle ABC, given that OB and OC are angle bisectors of angles B and C respectively, and angle A is 110 degrees.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Since OB bisects angle B, we have ∠ABO = ∠OBC. Similarly, since OC bisects angle C, we have ∠ACO = ∠OCB.

2. **Angle Sum Property of a Triangle:** The sum of all interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Applying this to triangle ABC, we get: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.

3. **Substituting Values:** We know ∠A = 110°. Substituting this into the equation from step 2, we get: 110° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.

4. **Solving for ∠B + ∠C:**  Subtracting 110° from both sides of the equation, we get: ∠B + ∠C = 70°.

5. **Focusing on Triangle BOC:** Now, let's look at triangle BOC. We know:
    * ∠BOC is the angle we need to find.
    * ∠OBC = 1/2 ∠B (since OB bisects ∠B)
    * ∠OCB = 1/2 ∠C (since OC bisects ∠C)

6. **Applying Angle Sum Property to Triangle BOC:** Using the angle sum property for triangle BOC, we get: ∠BOC + ∠OBC + ∠OCB = 180°.

7. **Substituting and Solving:** Substituting the values from step 5 into the equation from step 6, we get: ∠BOC + (1/2 ∠B) + (1/2 ∠C) = 180°.

    * Combining the terms with ∠B and ∠C, we get: ∠BOC + (1/2)(∠B + ∠C) = 180°.
    * From step 4, we know ∠B + ∠C = 70°. Substituting this, we get: ∠BOC + (1/2)(70°) = 180°.
    * Simplifying, we get: ∠BOC + 35° = 180°.
    * Subtracting 35° from both sides, we get: ∠BOC = 145°.

Therefore, ∠BOC = 145°.

In parallelogram ABCD, diagonals AC and BD intersect at point O. Given AC = 12.0, BD = 8.0, and AB = 7.0, find the perimeter of triangle OAB.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the location of points M and N on the sides BC and CD respectively, so that the perimeter of triangle AMN is as small as possible. This means we need to minimize the sum of the lengths AM, MN, and AN.

2. **Using the Reflection Principle:**  The key to solving this problem is to use the reflection principle.  Imagine reflecting point A across line BC to get point A'.  Similarly, reflect point A across line CD to get point A''.

3. **Analyzing the Reflections:**  Notice that:
    *  AM = A'M (because reflection preserves distances)
    *  AN = A''N (for the same reason)
    *  The perimeter of triangle AMN is AM + MN + AN = A'M + MN + A''N

4. **Minimizing the Perimeter:**  The shortest path from A' to A'' that passes through point M on BC and point N on CD is the straight line segment A'A''.  This is because any other path would create a longer distance.

5. **Finding the Angles:**  Since A'A'' is a straight line, ∠A'MA + ∠AMA'' = 180°.  Also, ∠A'MA = ∠AMN (because they are vertical angles) and ∠AMA'' = ∠ANM (for the same reason).

The image shows a diagram with two congruent triangles, ABC and DEF.  CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle E.

## Solution:

1. **Identify congruent angles:** Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle A = angle D = 22 degrees.

2. **Find angle BCD:**  CD bisects angle BCA, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts.  Since angle A = 22 degrees, and the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle BCA: 
    * Angle BCA = 180 degrees - angle A - angle B = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - 22 degrees = 136 degrees.
    * Angle BCD = angle BCA / 2 = 136 degrees / 2 = 68 degrees.

3. **Find angle DCG:**  Angles BCD and DCG are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore:
    * Angle DCG = 180 degrees - angle BCD = 180 degrees - 68 degrees = 112 degrees.

4. **Find angle DCE:**  Angles DCG and DCE are adjacent angles, meaning they share a common side and vertex.  We know angle CGF = 88 degrees, and the angles around a point add up to 360 degrees. Therefore:
    * Angle DCE = 360 degrees - angle DCG - angle CGF = 360 degrees - 112 degrees - 88 degrees = 160 degrees.

5. **Find angle E:**  Since triangle DCE is a triangle, the angles inside it add up to 180 degrees. Therefore:

* **Solution:**

    1. **Understanding Symmetry:**  Symmetry means that if we fold the figure along the line of symmetry, the two halves will perfectly overlap.

        * Similarly, ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ = 90°.

    3. **Using Angle Properties:**
        * Since ∠BAC = 110°, and ∠AMP = ∠BMP = 90°, we can find ∠MAP and ∠MBP:
            * ∠MAP = ∠MBP = (180° - 110°) / 2 = 35°

Find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of an isosceles right triangle with uniform areal density, where the length of each equal side is 'a'.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Concept:** The center of mass of an object is the point where its entire mass can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object like a triangle, the center of mass lies along its line of symmetry.

2. **Identifying the Line of Symmetry:** In this isosceles right triangle, the line of symmetry is the altitude drawn from the right angle vertex to the hypotenuse. This altitude divides the triangle into two congruent right-angled triangles.

3. **Finding the y-coordinate:**  The y-coordinate of the center of mass will be the distance from the base of the triangle to the point where the altitude intersects the hypotenuse.

The problem asks us to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b' in an infinitely long chain of resistors, where each resistor has a resistance of R = 1 ohm.

# Solution:
Here's how we can solve this problem:

1. **Simplify the Circuit:**  Imagine removing the first section of the circuit, leaving only the infinite chain starting from the second resistor. The resistance between points 'a' and 'b' will remain the same because the circuit is infinite.

2. **Identify the Pattern:** Notice that the remaining circuit is identical to the original circuit. This is the key to solving the problem.

3. **Set up an Equation:** Let 'x' represent the equivalent resistance of the infinite chain.  We can express the resistance of the original circuit in terms of 'x' as follows:

    * The first three resistors in the original circuit are in parallel. Their equivalent resistance is given by: 1/(1/1 + 1/1 + 1/1) = 1/3 ohm.
    * This equivalent resistance is in series with the remaining infinite chain, which has a resistance of 'x'.
    * Therefore, the total resistance of the original circuit is (1/3) + x.

4. **Solve for x:** Since the original circuit and the remaining infinite chain are identical, their resistances must be equal. This gives us the equation:

    * x = (1/3) + x

5. **Solve the Equation:** Subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get:

    * 0 = 1/3

    This equation has no solution. This means our initial assumption that the resistance of the infinite chain is finite is incorrect.

# Answer:
The equivalent resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' in this infinite chain of resistors is **infinite**.

Find the measure of angle NCL, denoted as  m∠NCL, in the given circle diagram where ∠NCR = (x - 1)°, ∠MCL = 60°, and ∠LCR = (3x + 5)°.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Concept:**  Angles around a point add up to 360°. This means that the sum of all the angles at the center of the circle (point C) must equal 360°.

2. **Setting up the Equation:** We can express this relationship as an equation:
   m∠NCR + m∠MCL + m∠LCR = 360°

3. **Substituting the Given Values:** Substitute the given angle measures into the equation:
   (x - 1)° + 60° + (3x + 5)° = 360°

4. **Simplifying the Equation:** Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
   4x + 64° = 360°

   m∠NCL = (x - 1)° + 60°
   m∠NCL = (74 - 1)° + 60°
   m∠NCL = 73° + 60°

In the figure above, ABCDEF is a regular hexagon, and its center is point O. What is the value of x?

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Regular Hexagons:** A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles. 

2. **Finding the Interior Angle of a Hexagon:** The sum of the interior angles of any polygon with *n* sides is given by the formula (n-2) * 180°.  For a hexagon (n=6), the sum of the interior angles is (6-2) * 180° = 720°. Since all angles in a regular hexagon are equal, each interior angle measures 720°/6 = 120°.

3. **Identifying the Angle at Point O:**  Angle BOC is one of the six central angles formed by connecting the center of the hexagon to two adjacent vertices. Since the hexagon is regular, these central angles are all equal.

4. **Calculating the Central Angle:** The six central angles form a complete circle, which has 360°. Therefore, each central angle measures 360°/6 = 60°.

5. **Finding x:** Angle BOC is 60°, and angle ABO is half of the interior angle of the hexagon, which is 120°/2 = 60°.  Therefore, x, which is the sum of angles ABO and BOC, is 60° + 60° = 120°.

Find the value of *x* in the given diagram, where angle *DCE* is (5*x* - 12) degrees and angle *DEC* is 3*x* degrees.

# Solution:
1. **Identify the relationship:**  Notice that angle *DCE* and angle *DEC* are angles in a triangle inscribed in a circle.  A key theorem in geometry states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Apply the theorem:**  Angle *DCE* intercepts arc *DE*, and angle *DEC* intercepts arc *DC*. Since the entire circle is 360 degrees, arc *DE* + arc *DC* = 360 degrees.

3. **Set up the equation:**  Using the theorem, we can write:
    *  angle *DCE* = (1/2) * arc *DE*
    *  angle *DEC* = (1/2) * arc *DC*

    Therefore, (5*x* - 12) = (1/2) * arc *DE* and 3*x* = (1/2) * arc *DC*.

4. **Solve for the arcs:**  Adding the two equations together, we get:
    * (5*x* - 12) + 3*x* = (1/2) * arc *DE* + (1/2) * arc *DC*
    * 8*x* - 12 = (1/2) * (arc *DE* + arc *DC*)

The degree measures of minor arc $\widehat{A C}$ and major arc $\widehat{A D C}$ are $x$ and $y$ respectively. If $m∠ABC = 70°$, find $x$.

# Solution:
1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc ADC.

2. **Applying the Formula:**  We can write the relationship as:  
   *  $m∠ABC = \frac{1}{2} * m\widehat{ADC}$

3. **Substituting Values:** We know that $m∠ABC = 70°$ and $m\widehat{ADC} = y$. Substituting these values into the formula:

Find the value of *x* to the nearest tenth, given a circle with a chord of length 15 and a tangent segment of length 8. The segment connecting the endpoint of the tangent segment to the endpoint of the chord on the circle has a length of 12.

## Solution:
This problem involves the use of a theorem called the **Tangent-Secant Theorem**. This theorem states that if a tangent and a secant are drawn to a circle from an external point, then the square of the tangent is equal to the product of the secant and its external segment.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Identify the tangent and secant:** In this problem, the segment of length 8 is the tangent, and the segment of length 12 + 15 = 27 is the secant.

2. **Apply the Tangent-Secant Theorem:** According to the theorem, the square of the tangent (8) is equal to the product of the secant (27) and its external segment (12). This can be written as: 
    * 8² = 27 * 12

3. **Solve for x:**  We know that the secant is made up of two segments: the external segment of length 12 and the internal segment of length *x*. Therefore, we can write the equation:
    * 8² = (x + 12) * 12

4. **Simplify and solve the equation:**
    * 64 = 12x + 144
    * -80 = 12x
    * x = -80/12
    * x = -6.67

5. **Consider the context:** Since we are dealing with lengths, the value of *x* cannot be negative. This indicates that there might be an error in the problem statement or the diagram. 

## Answer:
Based on the Tangent-Secant Theorem and the given information, the value of *x* should be -6.67. However, this answer is not physically possible as lengths cannot be negative. There might be an error in the problem statement or the diagram.

## Solution:

1. **Identify the key property:**  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, we know that ∠ACB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle.

2. **Apply the angle sum property of triangles:** In triangle ABC, we have: ∠ABC + ∠BAC + ∠ACB = 180 degrees.

3. **Substitute known values:** We know ∠ABD = 50 degrees, and since AB is a straight line, ∠ABC = 180 - ∠ABD = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. We also know ∠ACB = 90 degrees.

4. **Solve for ∠BAC:** Substituting the values into the angle sum property: 130 + ∠BAC + 90 = 180.  Therefore, ∠BAC = 180 - 130 - 90 = -40 degrees.

5. **Recognize the relationship between ∠BAC and ∠BCD:**  ∠BAC and ∠BCD are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc, CD.  Inscribed angles that intercept the same arc are equal.

6. **Determine ∠BCD:** Therefore, ∠BCD = ∠BAC = -40 degrees. However, angles are typically measured as positive values. Since a full circle is 360 degrees, we can add 360 to get the positive equivalent: ∠BCD = -40 + 360 = 320 degrees.

The image shows a regular pentagon ABCDE inscribed in a circle with center O. We need to find the measure of angle ADE.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Properties of Regular Polygons:** A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal.  Since ABCDE is a regular pentagon, all its interior angles are equal.

2. **Calculating the Interior Angle of a Regular Pentagon:** The sum of the interior angles of any polygon with *n* sides is given by the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees. For a pentagon (n=5), the sum of interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.  Therefore, each interior angle of a regular pentagon measures 540/5 = 108 degrees.

3. **Identifying the Central Angle:** Angle AOE is a central angle of the pentagon, formed by connecting two adjacent vertices of the pentagon to the center of the circle. Since the pentagon is regular, the central angle divides the circle into 5 equal parts. Therefore, angle AOE measures 360/5 = 72 degrees.

4. **Using Triangle Properties:** Triangle ADE is an isosceles triangle because AD and AE are radii of the circle and hence equal. Therefore, angles AED and DAE are equal.

5. **Applying Angle Sum Property:** The sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. In triangle ADE, we have:
    * Angle ADE + Angle AED + Angle DAE = 180 degrees
    * Since Angle AED = Angle DAE, we can write:
