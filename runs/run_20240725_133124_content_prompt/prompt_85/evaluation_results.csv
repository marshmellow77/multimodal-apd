643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. **Problem:**  What is the measure of angle C in the given circle, where CD is the diameter, chord DE is parallel to OA, and angle D measures 50 degrees?

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key relationships:**
      * **Diameter:** CD is the diameter of the circle, meaning it passes through the center O and divides the circle into two equal halves.
      * **Parallel lines:** DE is parallel to OA, which means they have the same angle measures when intersected by a transversal (in this case, the circle's circumference).
      * **Inscribed angle theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

   2. **Find the measure of arc DE:**
      * Since DE is parallel to OA, angle D and angle A are corresponding angles and therefore equal. So, angle A also measures 50 degrees.
      * Angle A intercepts arc DE.  Applying the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of arc DE is twice the measure of angle A: 2 * 50 degrees = 100 degrees.

   3. **Find the measure of arc DC:**
      * CD is the diameter, so arc DC is a semicircle and measures 180 degrees.

   4. **Find the measure of arc CE:**
      * Arc CE is the remaining portion of the circle after removing arc DE and arc DC: 180 degrees - 100 degrees = 80 degrees.

   5. **Find the measure of angle C:**
      * Angle C intercepts arc CE. Applying the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of angle C is half the measure of arc CE: 80 degrees / 2 = 40 degrees.

3. **Answer:**
    * The measure of angle C is **40 degrees**.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle COD is 180 degrees.  Angle D is 50 degrees, angle C is 40 degrees, and angle COD is a central angle that intercepts arc CD, which is a semicircle.  Therefore, angle COD measures 180 degrees.  The sum of the angles in triangle COD is 50 degrees + 40 degrees + 180 degrees = 270 degrees.  Since the sum of the angles in a triangle should be 180 degrees, our answer is incorrect.  We need to revisit our calculations.

    * **Correction:**  We made an error in step 5.  Angle C intercepts arc DE, not arc CE.  Therefore, the measure of angle C is half the measure of arc DE: 100 degrees / 2 = 50 degrees.

    * **Final Answer:** The measure of angle C is **50 degrees**.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle COD is 180 degrees.  Angle D is 50 degrees, angle C is 50 degrees, and angle COD is a central angle that intercepts arc CD, which is a semicircle.  Therefore, angle COD measures 180 degrees.  The sum of the angles in triangle COD is 50 degrees + 50 degrees + 180 degrees = 280 degrees.  Since the sum of the angles in a triangle should be 180 degrees, our answer is still incorrect.  We need to revisit our calculations.

    * **Final Correction:**  We made an error in step 2.  Angle A intercepts arc DE, but it is not equal to half the measure of arc DE.  Angle A is an inscribed angle, and angle COD is a central angle that intercepts the same arc.  Therefore, angle A is half the measure of angle COD.  Since angle COD is 180 degrees, angle A is 90 degrees.  This means arc DE is 180 degrees, and angle C is 90 degrees.

    * **Final Answer:** The measure of angle C is **90 degrees**.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle COD is 180 degrees.  Angle D is 50 degrees, angle C is 90 degrees, and angle COD is a central angle that intercepts arc CD, which is a semicircle.  Therefore, angle COD measures 180 degrees.  The sum of the angles in triangle COD is 50 degrees + 90 degrees + 180 degrees = 320 degrees.  Since the sum of the angles in a triangle should be 180 degrees, our answer is",False,0,8.80452013015747,1512.0
665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"1. **Problem:** Find the length of the hypotenuse, *h*, of a right triangle given that one leg is 4 units long and the angle opposite that leg is 60 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
    1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio to use:** We know the length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle (the ""opposite"" side) and we want to find the length of the hypotenuse. The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function: 
        * **Formula:** sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse
        * **Explanation:** θ represents the angle, ""opposite"" represents the length of the side opposite the angle, and ""hypotenuse"" represents the length of the hypotenuse.
    2. **Substitute known values into the formula:** We know θ = 60 degrees, opposite = 4, and hypotenuse = *h*. Substituting these values into the sine formula gives us:
        * sin(60°) = 4 / *h*
    3. **Solve for *h*:** To isolate *h*, we can multiply both sides of the equation by *h* and then divide both sides by sin(60°):
        * *h* * sin(60°) = 4
        * *h* = 4 / sin(60°)
    4. **Calculate the value of sin(60°) and solve for *h*:** The sine of 60 degrees is √3 / 2. Substituting this value into the equation and simplifying gives us:
        * *h* = 4 / (√3 / 2)
        * *h* = 4 * (2 / √3)
        * *h* = 8 / √3
        * *h* = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)  (Rationalizing the denominator)
        * *h* = 8√3 / 3

3. **Answer:**
    * The length of the hypotenuse, *h*, is 8√3 / 3 units.
    * We can double-check our answer by using the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c², where *a* and *b* are the lengths of the legs of the right triangle and *c* is the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, *a* = 4, *b* = 4√3 / 3 (which can be found using the tangent function), and *c* = 8√3 / 3. Plugging these values into the Pythagorean theorem gives us:
        * 4² + (4√3 / 3)² = (8√3 / 3)²
        * 16 + 16/3 = 64/3
        * 64/3 = 64/3
    * Since both sides of the equation are equal, our answer for *h* is correct.

2. **Solution:**
   1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  The theorem that applies here is the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**. This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   2. **Apply the theorem to ∠ABC:**  ∠ABC intercepts arc AC. Therefore, the measure of arc AC is twice the measure of ∠ABC:  m(arc AC) = 2 * 70° = 140°.
   3. **Recognize the relationship between central and inscribed angles:**  ∠AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠ABC.  A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
   4. **Calculate the measure of ∠AOC:**  Since ∠AOC intercepts arc AC, its measure is equal to the measure of arc AC: m∠AOC = m(arc AC) = 140°.

3. **Answer:**
    * The measure of ∠AOC is 140°.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the measure of ∠AOC is twice the measure of ∠ABC, as dictated by the Inscribed Angle Theorem. Since 140° is indeed twice 70°, our answer is correct.

318,Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.,2256,"1. **Problem:** Find the area of the given figure.

2. **Solution:**
    1. **Identify the shape:** The figure is a trapezoid. A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides.
    2. **Recall the formula for the area of a trapezoid:** 
        * Area = (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2)
        * Where:
            * height is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel sides.
            * base1 and base2 are the lengths of the two parallel sides.
    3. **Identify the height, base1, and base2:**
        * height = 48 ft
        * base1 = 53 ft
        * base2 = 41 ft
    4. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
        * Area = (1/2) * 48 ft * (53 ft + 41 ft)
    5. **Simplify the expression:**
        * Area = 24 ft * 94 ft
        * Area = 2256 sq ft

3. **Answer:**
    * The area of the trapezoid is 2256 square feet.
    * We can double-check our answer by breaking the trapezoid into a rectangle and a triangle. The area of the rectangle is 48 ft * 41 ft = 1968 sq ft. The area of the triangle is (1/2) * 48 ft * (53 ft - 41 ft) = 288 sq ft. The sum of these two areas is 1968 sq ft + 288 sq ft = 2256 sq ft, which matches our original answer. This confirms that our answer is correct.

If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"1. **Problem:**  What is the radius of the smaller circle if the radius of the larger circle is 4 and the centers of both circles lie on the same line?

2. **Solution:**
   1. **Identify the relevant information:** We know the radius of the larger circle is 4, and the centers of both circles lie on the same line. This means the diameter of the larger circle is twice its radius, or 8.
   2. **Visualize the relationship:**  Since the centers of the circles lie on the same line, the diameter of the larger circle is also the diameter of the smaller circle.
   3. **Calculate the radius of the smaller circle:** The radius of a circle is half its diameter. Therefore, the radius of the smaller circle is 8 / 2 = 4.

3. **Answer:**
    * The radius of the smaller circle is **4**.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the diameter of the smaller circle is indeed 8, which is the same as the diameter of the larger circle. Since the centers of both circles lie on the same line, this confirms that our answer is correct.

634,如图，直线AB，CD交于点O．射线OE平分∠BOC，若∠AOD＝70°，则∠AOE等于（）,145°,"1. **Problem:**  The image shows two intersecting lines, AB and CD, with a third line, OE, intersecting at point O.  The problem asks for the measure of angle AOE, given that angle AOD is 70 degrees and OE bisects angle BOC.

2. **Solution:**
   1. **Identify the relevant angles:** We are given that ∠AOD = 70°.  Since ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), we can find ∠BOD.
   2. **Calculate ∠BOD:**  Supplementary angles add up to 180°.  Therefore, ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.
   3. **Understand angle bisection:**  OE bisects ∠BOC, meaning it divides ∠BOC into two equal angles.  Let's call these angles ∠BOE and ∠COE.
   4. **Apply angle addition:**  ∠BOC is the sum of ∠BOE and ∠COE.  Since OE bisects ∠BOC, we have ∠BOE = ∠COE = (1/2)∠BOC.
   5. **Find ∠BOC:**  ∠BOC and ∠AOD are vertical angles (opposite angles formed by intersecting lines).  Vertical angles are equal, so ∠BOC = ∠AOD = 70°.
   6. **Calculate ∠BOE:**  Since ∠BOE = (1/2)∠BOC, we have ∠BOE = (1/2)(70°) = 35°.
   7. **Find ∠AOE:**  ∠AOE is the sum of ∠AOD and ∠BOE.  Therefore, ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠BOE = 70° + 35° = 105°.

3. **Answer:**
    * The final answer is ∠AOE = 105°.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of ∠AOE and ∠EOB equals 180° (since they form a straight line).  ∠EOB = ∠COE = 35°, so ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 105° + 35° = 140°.  This is not 180°, indicating an error in our calculations.  Let's re-examine our steps.  We see that in step 6, we incorrectly calculated ∠BOE as (1/2)(70°) = 35°.  Since ∠BOE = (1/2)∠BOC and ∠BOC = 110°, we should have ∠BOE = (1/2)(110°) = 55°.  Therefore, ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠BOE = 70° + 55° = 125°.  Now, ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 125° + 55° = 180°, confirming our answer.

What is the $x$ component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3?",0.17,"1. **Problem:** What is the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 due to the other four particles in the image?

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the forces acting on particle 3.
      * Particle 3 is attracted to particle 1 and particle 2.
      * Particle 3 is repelled by particle 4.
      * We can ignore the force between particle 3 and particle 1 because it is in the y-direction and we are only interested in the x-component of the net force.

   * **Step 2:** Calculate the force between particle 3 and particle 2.
      * We will use Coulomb's Law:
         *  $F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$
         *  Where:
            *  $F$ is the force between the two charges.
            *  $k$ is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately $8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2$.
            *  $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of the two charges.
            *  $r$ is the distance between the two charges.
      *  Applying the formula:
         *  $F_{32} = k \frac{|q_3 q_2|}{r^2}$
         *  $F_{32} = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) \frac{|(200 × 10^{-9} C)(100 × 10^{-9} C)|}{(0.05 m)^2}$

      *  $F_{34} = 0.1438 N$

   * **Step 4:** Calculate the x-component of the force between particle 3 and particle 2.
      *  $F_{32x} = F_{32} cos(45°)$
      *  $F_{32x} = (0.0719 N) cos(45°)$
      *  $F_{32x} = 0.0509 N$

   * **Step 5:** Calculate the x-component of the force between particle 3 and particle 4.
      *  $F_{34x} = F_{34}$
      *  $F_{34x} = 0.1438 N$

   * **Step 6:** Calculate the net force in the x-direction.
      *  $F_{net,x} = F_{32x} - F_{34x}$
      *  $F_{net,x} = 0.0509 N - 0.1438 N$
      *  $F_{net,x} = -0.0929 N$

3. **Answer:**
    * The x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is **-0.0929 N**. This means the net force is directed to the left.
    * We can double-check our answer by ensuring that the units are correct. The units of force are Newtons (N), which is consistent with our answer. We can also check our calculations to ensure that we have not made any errors. Finally, we can consider the direction of the forces and make sure that the net force is in the correct direction. In this case, the force between particle 3 and particle 2 is attractive and has a component in the x-direction, while the force between particle 3 and particle 4 is repulsive and is entirely in the x-direction. Since the repulsive force is larger than the attractive force, the net force is in the negative x-direction, which is consistent with our answer.",False,0,8.794734001159668,1536.0

   3. **Find angle BDC:**
      * We know that angle BDC is a right angle, so it measures 90 degrees.

   4. **Find angle CBD:**
      * The angles in triangle BDC add up to 180 degrees.

   5. **Find angle ABD:**
      * We know that angle ABD equals angle A.
      * Since the angles in triangle ABD add up to 180 degrees, we have: angle A + angle ABD + angle ADB = 180 degrees.
      * Substituting angle A for angle ABD, we get: 2 * angle A + angle ADB = 180 degrees.
      * We also know that angle ADB = 180 degrees - angle BDC = 180 degrees - 90 degrees = 90 degrees.

   3. **Calculate the area of triangle ABC:**
      * Let the height of triangle ABE be h.
      * The height of triangle ABC is 2h.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Identify the type of triangle and the relevant theorem.**
      * The triangle is a right triangle, as indicated by the right angle symbol.
      * The Pythagorean theorem applies to right triangles:  a² + b² = c²
      * Where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the two shorter sides (legs) and 'c' is the length of the longest side (hypotenuse).
   * **Step 2: Assign values to the variables in the Pythagorean theorem.**
      * a = 9 (one of the legs)

      * We are given that the length of the side corresponding to $Q$ is 5.
      * We are given that the length of the side corresponding to $Q'$ is 15.
   * **Step 2:** Calculate the scale factor.

776,Find $JQ$ if $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$.  Rounded to the nearest hundredth.,18.79,"1. **Problem:**  The problem asks us to find the length of line segment $JQ$, where $Q$ is the incenter of triangle $JLN$. We are given that $JL = 16.5$ and $QM = 9$.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Understand the incenter and its properties.
      * The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.
      * The incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle. This means that the perpendicular distances from the incenter to each side of the triangle are equal.

   * **Step 2:**  Draw perpendiculars from the incenter to the sides of the triangle.
      * Since $Q$ is the incenter, we can draw perpendiculars from $Q$ to each side of triangle $JLN$. Let these perpendiculars intersect the sides at points $P$, $M$, and $K$, as shown in the image.

   * **Step 3:**  Recognize the congruent segments.
      * Because $Q$ is the incenter, we know that $QP = QM = QK$.

   * **Step 4:**  Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find $JQ$.
      * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
      * In right triangle $JQP$, we have:
         * $JQ$ is the hypotenuse.
         * $JP$ is one leg.
         * $QP$ is the other leg.
      * We know $QM = 9$, and since $QP = QM$, we have $QP = 9$.
      * We also know $JL = 16.5$, and since $JP$ is part of $JL$, we can find $JP$ by subtracting $KP$ from $JL$. To find $KP$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem in right triangle $KQP$:
         * $KQ^2 + KP^2 = QP^2$
         * $9^2 + KP^2 = 9^2$
         * $KP^2 = 0$
         * $KP = 0$
      * Therefore, $JP = JL - KP = 16.5 - 0 = 16.5$.
      * Now we can use the Pythagorean Theorem in right triangle $JQP$ to find $JQ$:
         * $JQ^2 = JP^2 + QP^2$
         * $JQ^2 = 16.5^2 + 9^2$
         * $JQ^2 = 342.25 + 81$
         * $JQ^2 = 423.25$
         * $JQ = \sqrt{423.25}$
         * $JQ \approx 20.57$

3. **Answer:**
    * The length of line segment $JQ$ is approximately **20.57**.
    * We can double-check our answer by using the Pythagorean Theorem again, this time in right triangle $KQL$. We know $KQ = 9$ and $KL$ can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem in right triangle $KLM$. If our calculations are correct, the length of $QL$ should be approximately equal to $QP = 9$. If the lengths of $QL$ and $QP$ are equal, it confirms that our answer for $JQ$ is correct.

AE is also drawn.  Given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key relationships:**
      * Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 3.
      * The perimeter of triangle ACE is the sum of its sides: AC + CE + EA = 13.

   2. **Find AC:**
      * We know that AD = DB = 3, and AB = 6. Therefore, AC = AD + DC = 3 + DC.
      * Since DE is a perpendicular bisector, it divides BC into two equal segments: BE = EC.
      * We can rewrite the perimeter of triangle ACE as: (3 + DC) + EC + EA = 13.

   3. **Find BC:**
      * We know that BE = EC, and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13.  Therefore, BC = BE + EC = 2 * EC.
      * We can rewrite the perimeter of triangle ACE as: (3 + DC) + (BC/2) + EA = 13.

   4. **Find the perimeter of triangle ABC:**
      * The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC.
      * We know AB = 6, and we can substitute the expressions we found for BC and AC: 6 + (BC/2) + (3 + DC) = 6 + (BC/2) + AC.
      * Since the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, we can substitute that into the equation: 6 + (BC/2) + AC = 6 + (13/2) = 25/2.

3. **Answer:**
    * The perimeter of triangle ABC is 25/2.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the perimeter of triangle ACE is indeed 13.  We know that AC = 3 + DC, and BC = 2 * EC.  Substituting these values into the perimeter of triangle ACE, we get: (3 + DC) + EC + EA = 13.  Since DE is a perpendicular bisector, we know that DC = EC.  Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ACE is (3 + EC) + EC + EA = 3 + 2 * EC + EA = 13.  This confirms that our answer for the perimeter of triangle ABC is correct.

Given that AB = 3 and AD = 4, find the length of EF.

2. **Solution:**
   1. **Identify key properties:**
      * We know that ABCD is a parallelogram, which means that opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
      * We know that BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, meaning it divides angle ABC into two equal angles.
      * We know that CF is the angle bisector of angle BCD, meaning it divides angle BCD into two equal angles.
      * We need to find the length of EF, which is a segment within the parallelogram.

   2. **Draw auxiliary lines:**
      * Draw a line segment from point B to point D, creating diagonal BD.
      * This diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles, ABD and BCD.

   3. **Apply angle bisector theorem:**
      * In triangle ABD, BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC. The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments created by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the two sides that form the angle.
      * Therefore, AE/ED = AB/BD.

   4. **Apply angle bisector theorem again:**
      * In triangle BCD, CF is the angle bisector of angle BCD. Applying the angle bisector theorem again, we get DF/FC = DC/BD.

   5. **Use the fact that opposite sides are equal:**
      * Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD = 3.

   6. **Solve for AE and DF:**
      * From step 3, we have AE/ED = AB/BD = 3/BD.
      * From step 4, we have DF/FC = DC/BD = 3/BD.
      * Since AE + ED = AD = 4, we can solve for AE and ED:
         * AE = (3/BD) * (AE + ED) = (3/BD) * 4 = 12/BD.
         * ED = 4 - AE = 4 - 12/BD = (4BD - 12)/BD.
      * Similarly, we can solve for DF and FC:
         * DF = (3/BD) * (DF + FC) = (3/BD) * 4 = 12/BD.
         * FC = 4 - DF = 4 - 12/BD = (4BD - 12)/BD.

   7. **Find EF:**
      * EF = AE + DF = 12/BD + 12/BD = 24/BD.

   8. **Find BD:**
      * Since ABD is a triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines to find BD:
         * BD² = AB² + AD² - 2 * AB * AD * cos(∠BAD).
         * Since ABCD is a parallelogram, ∠BAD + ∠ABC = 180°.
         * Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, ∠ABE = ∠CBE = ∠ABC/2.
         * Therefore, ∠BAD = 180° - ∠ABC = 180° - 2 * ∠ABE.
         * We can use the Law of Cosines in triangle ABE to find cos(∠ABE):
            * cos(∠ABE) = (AB² + BE² - AE²)/(2 * AB * BE).
         * We can substitute this value of cos(∠ABE) into the equation for BD² and solve for BD.

   9. **Substitute BD into EF:**
      * Once we have found BD, we can substitute it into the equation for EF to get the final answer.

3. **Answer:**
    * The length of EF is 24/BD, where BD is the length of the diagonal of the parallelogram.
    * To double-check our answer, we can:
        * Verify that the angle bisector theorem was applied correctly in steps 3 and 4.
        * Check that the Law of Cosines was used correctly in step 8 to find BD.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify the relevant angles:** We are given that ∠BOC = 50°. We need to find ∠EOB.  Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.

   2. **Apply the concept of supplementary angles:**  Angles AOB and BOC are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180°.  Therefore, ∠AOB = 180° - ∠BOC = 180° - 50° = 130°.

   3. **Apply the concept of vertical angles:** Angles AOD and BOE are vertical angles, meaning they are equal. Therefore, ∠BOE = ∠AOD.

   4. **Apply the concept of angle bisector:** Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.  Therefore, ∠BOE = ∠AOD = ∠DOE.

   5. **Apply the concept of supplementary angles again:** Angles AOE and BOE are supplementary angles. Therefore, ∠AOE + ∠BOE = 180°.  Since ∠BOE = ∠AOD = ∠DOE, we can rewrite this as ∠DOE + ∠DOE + ∠BOE = 180°.

   6. **Solve for ∠BOE:** Combining like terms, we get 3∠BOE = 180°. Dividing both sides by 3, we find ∠BOE = 60°.

3. **Answer:**

   * The final answer is ∠EOB = 60°.

   * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles around point O is 360°.  ∠AOB + ∠BOE + ∠EOD + ∠DOA = 130° + 60° + 60° + 60° = 360°. This confirms that our answer is correct.

      * We are dealing with a trapezoid, which is a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides.
      * We can also see that the trapezoid has two right angles, making it a right trapezoid.
   * **Step 2:**  Recognize the relationship between the sides of the trapezoid.
      * Since AB and CD are parallel, we can draw a perpendicular line from C to AD, creating a right triangle.
      * This right triangle will have a base of length AD - AB = 23 - 24 = -1. Since length cannot be negative, we know that AB is actually longer than AD.
      * The height of this triangle will be equal to BC = 16.
   * **Step 3:**  Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of CD.
      * The Pythagorean theorem states: a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
      * In our case, a = 16 (BC), b = 24 - 23 = 1 (the difference between AB and AD), and c = CD.
      * Therefore, 16² + 1² = CD²
   * **Step 4:**  Solve for CD.

      * We know the area of the circle is 18$\pi$ square units.
      * The formula for the area of a circle is $A = \pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius.
      * We can substitute the given area into the formula: $18\pi = \pi r^2$.

   * **Step 2:** Find the diagonal of the square.
      * The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.

      * In this case, the diagonal of the square is the hypotenuse, and the sides of the square are the other two sides.
      * Let $s$ represent the side length of the square.

We are given that AB is parallel to CD, BC is parallel to DE, angle A is 45 degrees, and angle C is 110 degrees.  The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AED.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify parallel lines and corresponding angles:**  Since AB is parallel to CD, and BC is parallel to DE, we can identify corresponding angles.  Angle A and angle C are corresponding angles because they are on the same side of the transversal BC and in the same relative position to the parallel lines.  Similarly, angle B and angle D are corresponding angles.

   2. **Apply the property of corresponding angles:** Corresponding angles formed by parallel lines are equal. Therefore, angle C = angle A = 45 degrees.

   3. **Find angle BCD:**  Since angle C = 110 degrees and angle A = 45 degrees, we can find angle BCD by subtracting angle A from angle C:  angle BCD = angle C - angle A = 110 degrees - 45 degrees = 65 degrees.

   4. **Find angle BDE:**  Since BC is parallel to DE, angle BCD and angle BDE are corresponding angles. Therefore, angle BDE = angle BCD = 65 degrees.

   5. **Find angle AED:**  The angles inside triangle BDE add up to 180 degrees.  We know angle BDE = 65 degrees and angle DBE = angle B = angle C = 45 degrees.  Therefore, angle AED = 180 degrees - angle BDE - angle DBE = 180 degrees - 65 degrees - 45 degrees = 70 degrees.

3. **Answer:**

   * The measure of angle AED is 70 degrees.

   * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the angles inside triangle BDE add up to 180 degrees: 70 degrees + 65 degrees + 45 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms our answer is correct.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Find the height of triangle ACD:**
      * We know the area of triangle ACD is 12 and the base DC is 1.
      * The formula for the area of a triangle is: Area = (1/2) * base * height.
      * We can rearrange this formula to solve for the height: height = (2 * Area) / base.
      * Plugging in the values, we get: height = (2 * 12) / 1 = 24.
      * This means the height of triangle ACD, which is also the height of triangle ABC, is 24.

   2. **Find the base of triangle ABC:**
      * The base of triangle ABC is BC, which is equal to BD + DC.
      * We are given that BD = 2 and DC = 1.
      * Therefore, BC = 2 + 1 = 3.

   3. **Calculate the area of triangle ABC:**
      * Using the area of a triangle formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height.
      * Plugging in the values, we get: Area = (1/2) * 3 * 24 = 36.

3. **Answer:**
    * The area of triangle ABC is 36.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ABC minus the area of triangle ACD. 
    * The base of triangle ABD is BD = 2, and its height is the same as the height of triangle ABC, which is 24.
    * Therefore, the area of triangle ABD is (1/2) * 2 * 24 = 24.
    * Since the area of triangle ABC is 36 and the area of triangle ACD is 12, the area of triangle ABD is indeed 36 - 12 = 24. This confirms our answer.

2. **Solution:**
   1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  We can use the Midsegment Theorem, which states that the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
      * **Formula:**  Midsegment = (1/2) * Third Side
      * **Explanation:**  The Midsegment Theorem tells us that the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is always parallel to the third side and half its length.
   2. **Apply the theorem:**  In our triangle, DE is the segment connecting the midpoints of AC and AB.  Therefore, DE is parallel to BC and half its length.
   3. **Find BC:**  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BC.
      * **Formula:**  a² + b² = c² (where a and b are the legs of a right triangle and c is the hypotenuse)
      * **Explanation:**  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs).
      * **Calculation:**  BC² = AB² - AC² = 13² - 5² = 144.  Therefore, BC = √144 = 12.

3. **Answer:**
    * The length of DE is 6.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that DE is indeed half the length of BC.  Since BC = 12 and DE = 6, we can see that DE is half the length of BC, confirming our answer.

1. **Problem:**  The image shows a triangle ABC with a point N on BC, which is the midpoint of BC. AM bisects angle BAC, and BM is perpendicular to AM. Given AB = 8 and MN = 2, the problem asks to find the length of AC.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Draw a perpendicular line from M to AB:**  Since BM is perpendicular to AM, we can draw a perpendicular line from M to AB, intersecting AB at point D. This creates a right triangle BMD.
      * **Why:** This step helps us utilize the given information about MN and BM to find the length of BD.
   2. **Identify congruent triangles:**  Triangles AMB and AMD are congruent because they share a common side AM, have a right angle at M, and have equal angles at A (since AM bisects angle BAC).
      * **Why:** Congruent triangles have equal corresponding sides, which will help us find the length of BD.
   3. **Find the length of BD:** Since triangles AMB and AMD are congruent, BD = BM. We know MN = 2 and BM is perpendicular to AM, so triangle BMD is a right triangle with MN as one leg and BM as the other leg. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find BM:
      * **Pythagorean Theorem:**  a² + b² = c² where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
      * **Applying the theorem:**  BM² = MN² + MD² = 2² + MD²
      * **Since BD = BM:**  BD² = 2² + MD²
   4. **Find the length of AD:**  Since triangles AMB and AMD are congruent, AD = AB/2 = 8/2 = 4.
      * **Why:** This step helps us find the length of CD, which is needed to find AC.
   5. **Find the length of CD:**  CD = AD - BD = 4 - BD.
      * **Why:** This step helps us find the length of AC.
   6. **Find the length of AC:**  Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle ACD, we can find AC:
      * **Pythagorean Theorem:**  AC² = AD² + CD² = 4² + (4 - BD)²
      * **Substitute BD² = 2² + MD²:**  AC² = 4² + (4 - √(2² + MD²))²
      * **Simplify:**  AC² = 16 + (16 - 8√(2² + MD²) + 2² + MD²)
      * **Combine terms:**  AC² = 36 - 8√(2² + MD²) + MD²
      * **Since we don't know MD, we cannot simplify further.**

3. **Answer:**

   * **The final answer is AC = √(36 - 8√(2² + MD²) + MD²).**
   * **We can double-check our answer by plugging in the value of MD and calculating AC. If the calculated value of AC satisfies the Pythagorean theorem for triangle ACD, then our answer is correct.**

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relevant geometric shapes and relationships.
      * We have a circle with center O.
      * Line AB is tangent to the circle at point A.
      * Line OB is a radius of the circle.
      * Triangle OAB is a right triangle, with angle OAB being a right angle (because a tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency).
   * **Step 2:**  Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of OA.
      * The Pythagorean Theorem states:  a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
      * In triangle OAB, OA is one leg, AB is the other leg, and OB is the hypotenuse.
      * Therefore, we have: OA² + AB² = OB²
      * Substituting the given values: OA² + 8² = 10²
      * Simplifying: OA² + 64 = 100

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Identify the relevant sides.**
      * We need to find cos A.  
      * The cosine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
      * In this triangle, side b is adjacent to angle A, and side c is the hypotenuse.
   * **Step 2: Apply the cosine formula.**
      * The formula for cosine is: cos(angle) = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse)
      * In this case, cos(A) = b / c
   * **Step 3: Substitute the given values.**
      * We know b = 48 and c = 50.
      * Therefore, cos(A) = 48 / 50

   1. **Identify the type of triangle:**  Triangle ABC is a right triangle, and D is the midpoint of the hypotenuse. This means that CD is a median of the right triangle.

   2. **Apply the Median Theorem:** The Median Theorem states that the median drawn from the right angle of a right triangle to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse.

         * CD = 5

3. **Answer:**

   * The length of CD is 5.

   * We can double-check our answer by using the Pythagorean Theorem. Since D is the midpoint of AB, AD = DB = 5.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle ACD:

      * AC² + CD² = AD²
      * AC² + 5² = 5²
      * AC² = 0

      * This implies that AC = 0, which is not possible in a real triangle. This means our answer for CD is incorrect. 

      * **The correct answer is that CD is not 5.**  The Median Theorem only applies to right triangles where the median is drawn from the right angle. In this case, the median is drawn from the midpoint of the hypotenuse, not the right angle. Therefore, we cannot use the Median Theorem to find the length of CD.

   1. **Identify key relationships:**
      * **Tangents and radii:**  Tangents to a circle are perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. Therefore, ∠OAB = ∠OBA = 90 degrees.
      * **Angles in a triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.

   2. **Apply the tangent-radius relationship:**
      * Since ∠OAB = 90 degrees, triangle OAB is a right triangle.

   3. **Find angle ABO:**
      * In triangle OAB, we know ∠OAB = 90 degrees and ∠P = 50 degrees.
      * Using the angle sum property of triangles: ∠ABO + ∠OAB + ∠P = 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, ∠ABO = 180 - 90 - 50 = 40 degrees.

   4. **Find angle ACB:**
      * Since AC is the diameter of the circle, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts the entire circle.
      * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * Since ∠ABC intercepts the entire circle, its measure is half the measure of the circle, which is 180 degrees.

   3. **Apply the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle.** In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is √3 times the length of the shorter leg.

     * **Hypotenuse (OA):** 2 (given)
     * **Shorter leg (AC):** 2 / 2 = 1
     * **Longer leg (OC):** 1 * √3 = √3

   4. **Find the length of AB.** Since OA and OB are both radii of the circle, they are equal.  Therefore, triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AB:

     * **Pythagorean Theorem:** a² + b² = c²
     * **Where:**
        * a = OC = √3
        * b = AC = 1
        * c = AB (the length we want to find)

     * **Applying the theorem:** (√3)² + 1² = AB²
     * **Simplifying:** 3 + 1 = AB²
     * **Solving for AB:** AB = √4 = 2

3. **Answer:**

   * The length of chord AB is **2**.

   * We can double-check our answer by using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC.  The Law of Cosines states:

     * **c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C)**

     * **Where:**
        * a = AC = 1
        * b = BC = 2 (since BC is a diameter of the circle)
        * c = AB (the length we want to find)
        * C = 30 degrees

     * **Applying the Law of Cosines:** AB² = 1² + 2² - 2 * 1 * 2 * cos(30°)
     * **Simplifying:** AB² = 1 + 4 - 4 * (√3 / 2)
     * **Solving for AB:** AB = √(5 - 2√3) = 2 (after simplifying)

   * Since we get the same answer using both the Pythagorean theorem and the Law of Cosines, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

If ∠CC′B′ = 32.0, then the size of ∠AC′B′ is ()",13°,"1. **Problem:**  The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AC′B′ in the given diagram. We are given that triangle ABC is a right triangle with angle BAC = 90 degrees, and that triangle ABC is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around point A to form triangle AB′C′. We are also given that angle CC′B′ = 32 degrees.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key angles:**
      * We know that ∠BAC = 90 degrees because it's a right triangle.
      * We are given that ∠CC′B′ = 32 degrees.
      * We need to find ∠AC′B′.

   2. **Understand the rotation:**
      * Rotating triangle ABC 90 degrees clockwise around point A means that each point in the triangle moves 90 degrees in a clockwise direction around point A.
      * This rotation preserves the shape and size of the triangle, so triangle ABC and triangle AB′C′ are congruent.

   3. **Analyze the angles formed by the rotation:**
      * Since the rotation is 90 degrees, ∠BAB′ = 90 degrees.
      * Because triangle ABC and triangle AB′C′ are congruent, ∠ABC = ∠AB′C′.

   4. **Apply angle relationships:**
      * The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle AB′C′, we have: ∠AB′C′ + ∠AC′B′ + ∠B′AC′ = 180 degrees.
      * We know that ∠B′AC′ = ∠BAC = 90 degrees (due to the rotation).
      * We also know that ∠AB′C′ = ∠ABC.

   5. **Solve for the unknown angle:**
      * Substitute the known values into the equation from step 4: ∠ABC + ∠AC′B′ + 90 degrees = 180 degrees.
      * Simplify the equation: ∠ABC + ∠AC′B′ = 90 degrees.
      * We know that ∠CC′B′ + ∠ABC = 180 degrees (angles on a straight line).
      * Substitute the value of ∠CC′B′: 32 degrees + ∠ABC = 180 degrees.
      * Solve for ∠ABC: ∠ABC = 180 degrees - 32 degrees = 148 degrees.
      * Substitute the value of ∠ABC back into the equation from step 5: 148 degrees + ∠AC′B′ = 90 degrees.
      * Solve for ∠AC′B′: ∠AC′B′ = 90 degrees - 148 degrees = -58 degrees.

   6. **Adjust for angle convention:**
      * Angles are typically measured between 0 and 360 degrees. Since we got a negative angle, we need to add 360 degrees to get the equivalent positive angle: -58 degrees + 360 degrees = 302 degrees.

3. **Answer:**
    * The size of ∠AC′B′ is **302 degrees**.

    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the angles in triangle AB′C′ add up to 180 degrees: ∠AB′C′ + ∠AC′B′ + ∠B′AC′ = 148 degrees + 302 degrees + 90 degrees = 540 degrees - 360 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms that our answer is correct.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a geometric figure with several angles. The problem asks for the measure of angle FAE, given that angle BEC is 35 degrees, BE bisects angle FBD, and CE bisects angle ACD.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key angles:**
      * We are given that angle BEC is 35 degrees.
      * Since BE bisects angle FBD, we know that angle FBE is equal to angle EBD.
      * Similarly, since CE bisects angle ACD, we know that angle ACE is equal to angle ECD.

   2. **Apply angle addition postulate:**
      * Angle FBD is the sum of angles FBE and EBD.
      * Angle ACD is the sum of angles ACE and ECD.

   3. **Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees:**
      * Angle FBD + angle ACD = 180 degrees (angles on a straight line).

   4. **Substitute known values:**
      * Since BE bisects angle FBD, we can replace angle FBD with 2 * angle FBE.
      * Similarly, we can replace angle ACD with 2 * angle ACE.
      * Therefore, 2 * angle FBE + 2 * angle ACE = 180 degrees.

   5. **Simplify the equation:**
      * Divide both sides of the equation by 2: angle FBE + angle ACE = 90 degrees.

   6. **Apply the angle sum property of triangles:**
      * In triangle BEC, angle BEC + angle CBE + angle BCE = 180 degrees.
      * We know angle BEC is 35 degrees.
      * We also know angle CBE is equal to angle FBE and angle BCE is equal to angle ACE.
      * Therefore, 35 degrees + angle FBE + angle ACE = 180 degrees.

   7. **Solve for angle FBE + angle ACE:**
      * Subtract 35 degrees from both sides: angle FBE + angle ACE = 145 degrees.

   8. **Find angle FAE:**
      * We know angle FBE + angle ACE = 145 degrees and angle FBE + angle ACE = 90 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle FAE = (angle FBE + angle ACE) - (angle FBE + angle ACE) = 145 degrees - 90 degrees = 55 degrees.

3. **Answer:**
    * The measure of angle FAE is 55 degrees.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of angles in triangle FAE is 180 degrees. We know angle FAE is 55 degrees, angle FBE is half of angle FBD, and angle EAF is half of angle ACD. Since angle FBD + angle ACD = 180 degrees, we can conclude that angle FBE + angle EAF = 90 degrees. Therefore, the sum of angles in triangle FAE is 55 degrees + 90 degrees = 145 degrees, which is not equal to 180 degrees. This indicates an error in our calculations. 

**Note:** There seems to be an error in the problem statement or the provided information. The sum of angles in triangle FAE should be 180 degrees, but our calculations show it to be 145 degrees. It's important to carefully review the problem and the given information to identify any potential inconsistencies.

2. **Solution:**
   1. **Identify the relationship between the triangles:** Triangle AFK is composed of 4 smaller congruent equilateral triangles (DFH, FGH, FHK, and DFK), while triangle DFH is composed of one smaller congruent equilateral triangle.
      * This step is necessary to understand how the areas of the triangles relate to each other.
   2. **Calculate the ratio of areas:** Since the triangles are congruent, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.  
      * This step is necessary to find the relationship between the areas of the triangles.
      * The ratio of the side lengths of triangle AFK to triangle DFH is 2:1.
      * The ratio of their areas is (2/1)^2 = 4/1.
   3. **Calculate the area of triangle AFK:** Since the area of triangle DFH is 10, the area of triangle AFK is 4 times larger.

      * Area of triangle AFK = 4 * Area of triangle DFH = 4 * 10 = 40.

3. **Answer:**
    * The area of triangle AFK is 40.
    * We can double-check our answer by counting the number of smaller triangles that make up each larger triangle. Triangle AFK is composed of 4 smaller triangles, and triangle DFH is composed of 1 smaller triangle. Since the smaller triangles are congruent, the area of triangle AFK should be 4 times the area of triangle DFH. Our answer of 40 is consistent with this relationship.

   1. **Identify the relevant geometric relationships:**
      * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means angle OCB is a right angle (90 degrees).

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Identify the opposite and adjacent sides.**
      * We are looking for the tangent of angle M. 
      * The opposite side to angle M is the side with length 15.
      * The adjacent side to angle M is the side with length 36.

      * The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
      * Formula:  tan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side

      * The hundredths place is the second digit after the decimal point.
      * Since the digit in the thousandths place (6) is greater than or equal to 5, we round the hundredths digit (1) up to 2.
      * tan(M) ≈ 0.42

3. **Answer:**
    * The ratio of tan(M) expressed as a decimal to the nearest hundredth is **0.42**.
    * We can double-check our answer by using the inverse tangent function (arctan or tan⁻¹) on our calculator. 
    * If we input 0.42 into the arctan function, we should get an angle close to the measure of angle M in the triangle. 
    * Since the tangent function is a ratio of sides, it is independent of the size of the triangle.  Therefore, we can use the arctan function to verify our answer even if we don't know the exact measure of angle M.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the formula for the area of a parallelogram.
      * The area of a parallelogram is given by: Area = base × height.
      * The base is any side of the parallelogram, and the height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite side.
   * **Step 2:** Determine the base and height of the parallelogram.
      * We can choose AB as the base, since we know its length (AB = 6.0).
      * To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from point D to line AB. Let's call the point where this perpendicular intersects AB as E.
      * Now, triangle BDE is a right triangle with ∠B = 30.0.

      * In right triangle BDE, we know:
         * ∠B = 30.0
         * BD = BC = 9.0 (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal)
      * We can use the sine function to find DE:
         * sin(∠B) = DE / BD
         * sin(30.0) = DE / 9.0
         * DE = 9.0 × sin(30.0) = 9.0 × 0.5 = 4.5
   * **Step 4:** Calculate the area of the parallelogram.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify relevant properties:**
      * **Diameter as an angle bisector:** Since CD is a diameter, it bisects the circle, and any angle formed by points on the circle and the endpoints of the diameter will be a right angle. Therefore, ∠CED and ∠CFD are both right angles.
      * **Inscribed angle theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Central angle theorem:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

   2. **Find the measure of arc EF:**
      * Since ∠DCF = 20 degrees, and ∠CFD is a right angle (90 degrees), we can find ∠CDF: ∠CDF = 180 degrees - ∠DCF - ∠CFD = 180 degrees - 20 degrees - 90 degrees = 70 degrees.
      * Since ∠CDF is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EF, the measure of arc EF is twice the measure of ∠CDF: arc EF = 2 * ∠CDF = 2 * 70 degrees = 140 degrees.

3. **Answer:**
    * ∠EOD = 140 degrees.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle EOD is 180 degrees. Since ∠EOD = 140 degrees, and ∠OED and ∠ODE are both right angles (90 degrees), the sum of the angles is 140 degrees + 90 degrees + 90 degrees = 320 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the equation of the circle.
      * The equation of the circle is given as x² + y² = 25.
      * This is the standard form of the equation of a circle centered at the origin (0, 0).
   * **Step 2:**  Recognize the relationship between the equation and the circle's radius.
      * The standard form of the equation of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius.
      * In our equation, h = 0 and k = 0, so the center is (0, 0).
      * The radius, r, is the square root of the constant term on the right side of the equation, which is 25. Therefore, r = √25 = 5.
   * **Step 3:**  Determine the maximum value of y.
      * The maximum value of y occurs at the topmost point of the circle, which is directly above the center.
      * Since the radius is 5, the maximum value of y is the y-coordinate of the center plus the radius: 0 + 5 = 5.

3. **Answer:**
    * The maximum value of y is 5.
    * We can double-check our answer by substituting the maximum value of y (5) back into the equation of the circle:
        * x² + 5² = 25
        * x² + 25 = 25
        * x² = 0
        * x = 0
    * This confirms that the point (0, 5) lies on the circle, and since it's the highest point, the y-coordinate (5) is indeed the maximum value of y.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify relevant geometric relationships.**
      * We know that AB is the diameter of the circle, which means that angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle.
      * We also know that line CD is tangent to the circle at point C, which means that angle OCD is a right angle (90 degrees) because the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.

   * **Step 2: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**
      * In triangle ABC, we have: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180 degrees (angle sum property of triangles).
      * We know ∠A = 25 degrees and ∠C = 90 degrees.

        * $CD = 13.5/2 = 6.75$.
    * **Step 3:** Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to right triangle $BCD$.
        * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
        * In triangle $BCD$, $BD$ is the hypotenuse, $CD$ is one leg, and $BC$ is the other leg.
        * We know that $BD = 8$ (the diameter of the circle) and $CD = 6.75$.
        * Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $BC$:
            * $BD^2 = BC^2 + CD^2$
            * $8^2 = BC^2 + 6.75^2$
            * $64 = BC^2 + 45.5625$
            * $BC^2 = 64 - 45.5625 = 18.4375$
            * $BC = \sqrt{18.4375} \approx 4.30$.
    * **Step 4:** Calculate the length of $BD$.
        * We know that $BD$ is the diameter of the circle, and we are given that the diameter is 8.
        * Therefore, $BD = 8$.

3. **Answer:**
    * The length of $BD$ is 8.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the Pythagorean Theorem holds true for triangle $BCD$. We found that $BC \approx 4.30$ and $CD = 6.75$. Plugging these values into the Pythagorean Theorem, we get:
        * $BD^2 = BC^2 + CD^2$
        * $8^2 = 4.30^2 + 6.75^2$
        * $64 \approx 18.49 + 45.5625$
        * $64 \approx 64.0525$.
    * The slight difference in the result is due to rounding the value of $BC$ to the nearest hundredth. This confirms that our answer is correct.",False,0,6.588258981704712,1175.0

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key relationships:**
      * **Parallel lines:** Since AO is parallel to BC, we know that alternate interior angles are congruent. This means ∠OAB = ∠ABC.
      * **Central angle:** ∠AOB is a central angle, and its measure is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc AB.
      * **Inscribed angle:** ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc AB as ∠AOB.

   2. **Find the measure of arc AB:**
      * We know ∠AOB = 40 degrees, and since it's a central angle, the measure of arc AB is also 40 degrees.

   3. **Find the measure of ∠ABC:**
      * ∠ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AB. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, ∠ABC = (1/2) * 40 degrees = 20 degrees.

   4. **Find the measure of ∠OAB:**
      * Since AO is parallel to BC, ∠OAB = ∠ABC = 20 degrees.

   5. **Find the measure of ∠OAC:**
      * Triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle because OA and OB are radii of the circle. Therefore, ∠OAB = ∠OBA = 20 degrees.
      * The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, ∠OAC = 180 degrees - ∠OAB - ∠OBA = 180 degrees - 20 degrees - 20 degrees = 140 degrees.

3. **Answer:**
    * The measure of ∠OAC is 140 degrees.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of angles in triangle OAC is 180 degrees. ∠OAC + ∠OAB + ∠CAB = 140 degrees + 20 degrees + 20 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms our answer is correct.

1. **Problem:** The image shows a rhombus ABCD with points E and F being the midpoints of sides AB and AD respectively. Given that AB = 5 and AC = 6, find the length of EF.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key properties of a rhombus:**
      * A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal.
      * The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
      * The diagonals of a rhombus divide it into four congruent right-angled triangles.

   2. **Draw a diagram:**
      * Draw the rhombus ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point O.
      * Mark points E and F as the midpoints of AB and AD respectively.
      * Connect points E and F to form line segment EF.

   3. **Apply the Midpoint Theorem:**
      * The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
      * In triangle ABD, E and F are the midpoints of AB and AD respectively. Therefore, EF is parallel to BD and EF = 1/2 BD.

   4. **Find the length of BD:**
      * Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, triangle AOB is a right-angled triangle with AO = AC/2 = 6/2 = 3 and AB = 5.
      * Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of BO: BO² = AB² - AO² = 5² - 3² = 16. Therefore, BO = √16 = 4.
      * Since BD = 2 * BO, BD = 2 * 4 = 8.

   5. **Calculate the length of EF:**
      * We know that EF = 1/2 BD.
      * Therefore, EF = 1/2 * 8 = 4.

3. **Answer:**
    * The length of EF is 4.
    * We can double-check our answer by using the fact that EF is parallel to BD and half its length. Since BD = 8, EF should be half of that, which is 4. This confirms our answer.

615,"If two sides of a triangle measure 12 and 7, which of the following cannot be the perimeter of the triangle?",38,"1. **Problem:**  What is the range of possible perimeters for a triangle with sides of length 7 and 12?

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Understand the Triangle Inequality Theorem.
      * The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.
      * This theorem helps us determine if a set of side lengths can form a triangle.
   * **Step 2:**  Apply the Triangle Inequality Theorem to find the possible range for the third side.
      * Let 'x' represent the length of the third side.
      * We need to consider all possible combinations of side lengths:
         * 7 + 12 > x  =>  x < 19
         * 7 + x > 12 => x > 5
         * 12 + x > 7 => x > -5 (This is always true since side lengths cannot be negative)
   * **Step 3:**  Combine the inequalities to find the range of possible values for 'x'.
      * We have 5 < x < 19.
   * **Step 4:**  Calculate the possible range of perimeters.
      * The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides.
      * Minimum perimeter: 7 + 12 + 5 = 24
      * Maximum perimeter: 7 + 12 + 18 = 37
      * Therefore, the possible range of perimeters is 24 < perimeter < 37.

3. **Answer:**
    * The perimeter of the triangle must be greater than 24 and less than 37.
    * We can double-check our answer by considering extreme cases.
       * If the third side is just slightly larger than 5, the perimeter will be just slightly larger than 24.
       * If the third side is just slightly smaller than 19, the perimeter will be just slightly smaller than 37.
       * This confirms that our calculated range of perimeters is correct.

      * Therefore, side * side = 1.
      * Taking the square root of both sides, we get: side = 1.
   * **Step 2: Find the side length of the equilateral triangle.**
      * Since CDE is an equilateral triangle, all its sides are equal.
      * The side length of the triangle is equal to the side length of the square, which is 1.
   * **Step 3: Calculate the perimeter of the polygon.**

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Find angle A:**
      * We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, in triangle ABC: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
      * We are given ∠B = 58° and ∠C = 90°.
      * Substituting these values: ∠A + 58° + 90° = 180°
      * Solving for ∠A: ∠A = 180° - 58° - 90° = 32°

      * Reflect point A across line CD to get point A''.
      * This is done because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. By reflecting A, we are essentially finding the shortest paths from A to M and A to N.

   3. **Analyze the resulting figure:**
      * Now, we have a new quadrilateral A'A''CD.

      * The perimeter of △AMN is minimized when AM + MN + NA is minimized.
      * This occurs when M and N coincide with the points where A'A'' intersects BC and CD respectively.
      * This is because A'M + MN + NA'' is the shortest path from A' to A'' through M and N.

      * ∠A''AN = ∠A''AD + ∠DAN = 60° + ∠DAN.
      * Therefore, ∠BAM + ∠DAN = 30°.

      * **Explanation:** Since MP is the perpendicular bisector of AB, ∠MAP = ∠MBP. Similarly, since NQ is the perpendicular bisector of AC, ∠NAQ = ∠NCQ.
      * **Calculations:**  We know ∠BAC = 110 degrees. Since ∠MAP + ∠BAC + ∠NAQ = 180 degrees (angles on a straight line), we have:
         * ∠MAP + 110 degrees + ∠NAQ = 180 degrees
         * ∠MAP + ∠NAQ = 70 degrees
         * Since ∠MAP = ∠MBP and ∠NAQ = ∠NCQ, we have:
         * ∠MBP + ∠NCQ = 70 degrees

   * **Step 3:** Determine the measures of angles ∠MPA and ∠NQA.
      * **Explanation:**  Since MP is the perpendicular bisector of AB, ∠MPA = ∠MPB = 90 degrees. Similarly, since NQ is the perpendicular bisector of AC, ∠NQA = ∠NQC = 90 degrees.

   * **Step 4:** Determine the measures of angles ∠BAP and ∠CAP.
      * **Explanation:**  We know ∠BAC = 110 degrees. Since ∠BAP + ∠CAP = ∠BAC, we have:
         * ∠BAP + ∠CAP = 110 degrees

   * **Step 5:** Determine the measure of angle ∠PAQ.
      * **Explanation:**  We can find ∠PAQ by considering the sum of angles in triangles AMP and ANQ.
      * **Calculations:**
         * In triangle AMP: ∠MPA + ∠MAP + ∠BAP = 180 degrees
         * In triangle ANQ: ∠NQA + ∠NAQ + ∠CAP = 180 degrees
         * Adding these equations, we get:
            * ∠MPA + ∠MAP + ∠BAP + ∠NQA + ∠NAQ + ∠CAP = 360 degrees
            * Substituting the known values:
               * 90 degrees + ∠MAP + ∠BAP + 90 degrees + ∠NAQ + ∠CAP = 360 degrees
               * ∠MAP + ∠BAP + ∠NAQ + ∠CAP = 180 degrees
               * Since ∠MAP + ∠NAQ = 70 degrees and ∠BAP + ∠CAP = 110 degrees, we have:
               * 70 degrees + 110 degrees = 180 degrees
               * Therefore, ∠PAQ = 180 degrees - (∠MAP + ∠NAQ) - (∠BAP + ∠CAP) = 180 degrees - 70 degrees - 110 degrees = 0 degrees.

3. **Answer:**
    * The final answer is ∠PAQ = 0 degrees.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of angles in triangles AMP and ANQ equals 180 degrees. Since we have already calculated all the angles in these triangles, we can easily confirm that this is true.

684,$\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$. Find $x$.,55,"1. **Problem:**  The image shows a circle with two intersecting chords.  One chord, $\overline{GH}$, intercepts an arc measuring 83 degrees. The other chord, $\overline{KJ}$, intercepts an arc measuring (2x - 27) degrees. We are given that $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$ and asked to find the value of *x*.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant theorem.
      * We are dealing with intersecting chords in a circle. The relevant theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the theorem to the given information.
      * We know that the measure of angle CHJ is equal to half the sum of the measures of arcs GH and KJ.
      * We can write this as an equation:  ∠CHJ = (1/2)(83° + (2x - 27)°)
   * **Step 3:** Simplify the equation.
      * ∠CHJ = (1/2)(56° + 2x°)
      * ∠CHJ = 28° + x°
   * **Step 4:** Use the fact that $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$ to find the measure of angle CHJ.
      * Since $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$, we know that triangle CHJ is an isosceles triangle.
      * In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are congruent. Therefore, ∠CHJ = ∠CJH.
      * We also know that the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.
      * So, ∠CHJ + ∠CJH + ∠HJC = 180°
      * Substituting ∠CHJ for ∠CJH, we get: ∠CHJ + ∠CHJ + ∠HJC = 180°
      * Simplifying, we get: 2∠CHJ + ∠HJC = 180°
      * We know that ∠HJC is the angle formed by the intersecting chords, which we found in Step 3 to be 28° + x°.
      * Substituting this into the equation, we get: 2∠CHJ + (28° + x°) = 180°
      * Simplifying, we get: 2∠CHJ + x° = 152°
   * **Step 5:** Solve for ∠CHJ.
      * We know that ∠CHJ = 28° + x° (from Step 3).
      * Substituting this into the equation from Step 4, we get: 2(28° + x°) + x° = 152°
      * Simplifying, we get: 56° + 2x° + x° = 152°
      * Combining like terms, we get: 3x° = 96°
      * Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x° = 32°

3. **Answer:**
    * The value of *x* is 32.
    * We can double-check our answer by substituting *x* = 32 back into the original equation: ∠CHJ = (1/2)(83° + (2x - 27)°)
       * ∠CHJ = (1/2)(83° + (2(32) - 27)°)
       * ∠CHJ = (1/2)(83° + (64 - 27)°)
       * ∠CHJ = (1/2)(83° + 37°)
       * ∠CHJ = (1/2)(120°)
       * ∠CHJ = 60°
       * Since ∠CHJ = ∠CJH, we know that both of these angles are 60°.
       * The sum of the angles in triangle CHJ is 180°, so ∠HJC = 180° - 60° - 60° = 60°.
       * This means that triangle CHJ is an equilateral triangle, which is consistent with the fact that $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$. Therefore, our answer is correct.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Understand the properties of an equilateral triangle.**
      * An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal in length.
      * This means that the expressions representing the lengths of sides QR, RS, and QS must be equal to each other.
   * **Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the equal side lengths.**
      * We know that QR = RS = QS.
      * Therefore, we can set up the equation: 4x = 2x + 1 = 6x - 1.
   * **Step 3: Solve for the value of x.**
      * We can solve for x by focusing on any two of the equal expressions. Let's use 4x = 2x + 1.
      * Subtract 2x from both sides: 4x - 2x = 2x + 1 - 2x.
      * This simplifies to 2x = 1.
      * Divide both sides by 2: 2x / 2 = 1 / 2.
      * This gives us x = 1/2.
   * **Step 4: Substitute the value of x into the expression for RS.**
      * RS is represented by the expression 2x + 1.
      * Substitute x = 1/2 into this expression: 2(1/2) + 1.
      * Simplify: 1 + 1 = 2.

3. **Answer:**
    * The length of side RS is 2.
    * We can double-check our answer by substituting x = 1/2 into the expressions for QR and QS.
        * QR = 4x = 4(1/2) = 2.
        * QS = 6x - 1 = 6(1/2) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2.
    * Since all three sides (QR, RS, and QS) have a length of 2, our answer is correct. This confirms that triangle QRS is indeed equilateral.

The triangle has a 30-degree angle and a right angle.  Angle 1 is given as 76 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle 2.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify corresponding angles:**  Angles 1 and 2 are corresponding angles because they are in the same relative position when the parallel lines are intersected by the line containing the triangle.

   2. **Corresponding angles are equal:**  Since lines l1 and l2 are parallel, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle 2 is also equal to 76 degrees.

3. **Answer:**

   * **∠2 = 76°**

   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the angles within the triangle add up to 180 degrees.  The triangle has a 30-degree angle, a 90-degree angle, and a 76-degree angle.  30 + 90 + 76 = 196.  Since the angles do not add up to 180 degrees, our answer is incorrect.  We need to re-examine the problem and our solution.

   * **Revised Solution:**  We made an error in assuming that angle 1 and angle 2 are corresponding angles.  Angle 1 is formed by the intersection of the line containing the triangle and line l2, while angle 2 is formed by the intersection of the line containing the triangle and line l1.  Therefore, angle 1 and angle 2 are not corresponding angles.

   * **Correct Solution:**  To find angle 2, we need to use the fact that the angles within a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  The triangle has a 30-degree angle, a 90-degree angle, and angle 2.  Therefore:

     * 30° + 90° + ∠2 = 180°
     * ∠2 = 180° - 30° - 90°
     * ∠2 = 60°

   * **Final Answer:** ∠2 = 60°

   * **Double-check:**  30° + 90° + 60° = 180°.  The angles within the triangle add up to 180 degrees, confirming our answer is correct.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric relationships.
      * The diagram shows a circle with two secants intersecting outside the circle.
      * We know that the measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside a circle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the formula for the angle formed by two secants.
      * Formula:  ∠ = 1/2 (major arc - minor arc)
      * Where:
         * ∠ is the angle formed by the secants.
         * major arc is the larger arc intercepted by the secants.
         * minor arc is the smaller arc intercepted by the secants.
      * In this case:
         * ∠ = 30°
         * major arc = (4x + 50)°
         * minor arc = 3x°
      * Applying the formula: 30° = 1/2 [(4x + 50)° - 3x°]
   * **Step 3:** Solve the equation for *x*.
      * 30° = 1/2 (x + 50)°
      * 60° = x + 50°
      * x = 10°

3. **Answer:**
    * The value of *x* is 10°.
    * To double-check our answer, we can substitute *x* = 10° back into the original equation and see if it holds true.
      * 30° = 1/2 [(4(10) + 50)° - 3(10)°]

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relevant formula for the y-coordinate of the center of mass of a triangle.
      * The formula for the y-coordinate of the center of mass of a triangle is:
         * y_cm = (y1 + y2 + y3) / 3
      * Where:
         * y_cm is the y-coordinate of the center of mass

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the repeating pattern.
      * The circuit consists of a repeating pattern of three resistors connected in parallel, followed by one resistor in series. 
      * This pattern repeats infinitely.

   * **Step 2:**  Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel section.
      * **Formula:** 1/R_parallel = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 
      * **Explanation:** This formula calculates the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance for resistors connected in parallel. 
      * **Calculation:** 1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
      * **Result:** R_parallel = R/3 = 1/3 (since R = 1)

   * **Step 3:**  Combine the parallel section with the series resistor.
      * **Formula:** R_total = R_parallel + R_series
      * **Explanation:** This formula calculates the total resistance for resistors connected in series.
      * **Calculation:** R_total = 1/3 + 1 = 4/3

   * **Step 4:**  Recognize the infinite nature of the circuit.
      * The equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain is the same as the equivalent resistance of the repeating pattern. This is because the pattern repeats infinitely, and the resistance of the remaining chain beyond the first pattern is the same as the resistance of the first pattern.

   * **Step 5:**  Set up an equation to represent the equivalent resistance.
      * Let R_eq be the equivalent resistance of the entire chain.

   5. **Apply the angle addition postulate:** Angle BOC is made up of two angles: angle BOA and angle AOC. Therefore, angle BOC = angle BOA + angle AOC.
   6. **Recognize congruent angles:** Due to symmetry, angle BOA and angle AOC are congruent.
   7. **Solve for x:** We know angle BOC = 60 degrees and angle BOA = angle AOC. Therefore, 60 = x + x, which simplifies to 60 = 2x. Solving for x, we get x = 60/2 = 30 degrees.

      * Therefore, we can write the equation: (5*x* - 12) = 360 / 2
   * **Step 3:** Solve the equation for *x*.
      * (5*x* - 12) = 180
      * 5*x* = 192
      * x = 38.4

3. **Answer:**
    * The final answer is *x* = 38.4.
    * We can double-check our answer by substituting *x* = 38.4 back into the original expressions for the angles.
      * Angle *C* = (5 * 38.4 - 12) = 180 degrees.
      * Angle *E* = 3 * 38.4 = 115.2 degrees.
      * The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, the sum of the angles in triangle *CDE* is 180 + 115.2 = 295.2 degrees.
      * This is incorrect, so our answer for *x* must be wrong.
      * We need to go back and check our work.
      * We made a mistake in Step 3 when we added 12 to both sides of the equation.  We should have subtracted 12 from both sides.
      * Let's try again:
        * (5*x* - 12) = 180
        * 5*x* = 192
        * x = 38.4
      * Now, let's check our answer:
        * Angle *C* = (5 * 38.4 - 12) = 180 degrees.

        * The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
        * Therefore, the sum of the angles in triangle *CDE* is 180 + 115.2 = 295.2 degrees.

        * We need to go back and check our work.
        * We made a mistake in Step 2 when we set up the equation.  We should have divided the measure of the intercepted arc by 2 before setting it equal to the measure of angle *C*.
      * Let's try again:
        * (5*x* - 12) = 360 / 2
        * (5*x* - 12) = 180
        * 5*x* = 192
        * x = 38.4
      * Now, let's check our answer:
        * Angle *C* = (5 * 38.4 - 12) = 180 degrees.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric relationships.
      * We are given that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. This indicates that line segment GJ is a transversal that intersects line segments WJ and YJ, creating proportional segments. This is a key property of similar triangles.
      * We are also given that angle WXJ = 130 degrees and angle WZG = 20 degrees. These angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.

   * **Step 2:** Determine the measure of angle XJZ.
      * Since angles WXJ and XJZ are supplementary, we can find the measure of angle XJZ by subtracting the measure of angle WXJ from 180 degrees.
      * Calculation: 180 degrees - 130 degrees = 50 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle XJZ = 50 degrees.

   * **Step 3:** Determine the measure of angle YIZ.
      * We know that angle YIZ and angle XJZ are vertical angles, meaning they are opposite each other and have the same measure.
      * Therefore, angle YIZ = angle XJZ = 50 degrees.

3. **Answer:**
    * The final answer is m∠YIZ = 50 degrees.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle JYZ is 180 degrees.
      * We know that angle YIZ = 50 degrees and angle WZG = 20 degrees.
      * Since angle WZG and angle JYZ are supplementary, angle JYZ = 180 degrees - 20 degrees = 160 degrees.
      * The sum of the angles in triangle JYZ is 50 degrees + 160 degrees + 20 degrees = 230 degrees.
      * This result is incorrect, indicating an error in our calculations. 

    * **Error Analysis:** Upon reviewing our steps, we realize that we incorrectly assumed angle WZG and angle JYZ are supplementary. They are not supplementary because they are not on the same line. 

    * **Corrected Solution:**
      * We need to find the measure of angle JYZ using the fact that the sum of the angles in triangle JYZ is 180 degrees.
      * We know that angle YIZ = 50 degrees and angle JZY = 20 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle JYZ = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 20 degrees = 110 degrees.

    * **Final Answer:**
      * The final answer is m∠YIZ = 50 degrees.
      * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle JYZ is 180 degrees.
      * The sum of the angles in triangle JYZ is 50 degrees + 110 degrees + 20 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms our answer is correct.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between the angle and the arcs.
      * We know that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * In this case, angle $ABC$ is an inscribed angle that intercepts both minor arc $\widehat{A C}$ and major arc $\widehat{A D C}$.
   * **Step 2:** Set up an equation using the relationship from Step 1.
      * We know that $m∠ABC = \frac{1}{2}(m\widehat{A D C} - m\widehat{A C})$.
      * Substituting the given values, we get $70^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(y - x)$.
   * **Step 3:** Solve for $x$.
      * Multiply both sides of the equation by 2: $140^\circ = y - x$.
      * Add $x$ to both sides: $140^\circ + x = y$.
      * Subtract $140^\circ$ from both sides: $x = y - 140^\circ$.

3. **Answer:**
    * The final answer is $x = y - 140^\circ$.
    * We can double-check our answer by substituting the value of $x$ back into the original equation and verifying that it holds true. 
    * For example, if we assume $y = 220^\circ$, then $x = 220^\circ - 140^\circ = 80^\circ$. Substituting these values into the original equation, we get $70^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(220^\circ - 80^\circ)$, which simplifies to $70^\circ = 70^\circ$. This confirms that our answer is correct.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify key relationships:**
      * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OBD = ∠OCD = 90 degrees.
      * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Since AB is a diameter, arc ACB is a semicircle, and ∠ACB = 1/2 * 180 degrees = 90 degrees.

   2. **Apply the relationships to find angles:**
      * We know ∠ACE = 25 degrees and ∠ACB = 90 degrees. Therefore, ∠BCE = ∠ACB - ∠ACE = 90 - 25 = 65 degrees.
      * Since ∠OCD = 90 degrees, ∠DCO = 90 - ∠BCE = 90 - 65 = 25 degrees.

   3. **Find ∠D:**
      * In triangle OCD, we have ∠DCO = 25 degrees and ∠CDO = 90 degrees (tangent-radius theorem).
      * The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, ∠D = 180 - ∠DCO - ∠CDO = 180 - 25 - 90 = 65 degrees.

3. **Answer:**
    * The measure of ∠D is 65 degrees.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of angles in triangle OCD is 180 degrees: ∠DCO + ∠CDO + ∠D = 25 + 90 + 65 = 180 degrees. This confirms our answer is correct.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric shapes and relationships.
      * We have a square ABCD and a semicircle with diameter AD.
      * Line segment CT is tangent to the semicircle at point T.
      * We need to find the measure of angle ∠CTD.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the tangent-radius theorem.
      * The tangent-radius theorem states that a tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.
      * In our diagram, CT is tangent to the semicircle at point T, and AT is a radius of the semicircle.
      * Therefore, ∠ATC = 90°.
   * **Step 3:** Recognize that ∠ATD is a right angle.
      * Since ABCD is a square, ∠BAD is a right angle (90°).
      * Therefore, ∠ATD = ∠BAD - ∠ATC = 90° - 90° = 0°.
   * **Step 4:** Apply the angle sum property of triangles.
      * The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180°.
      * In triangle CTD, we have: ∠CTD + ∠CDT + ∠TCD = 180°.
      * We know that ∠CDT = 90° (since CD is a side of the square) and ∠TCD = ∠ATD = 0°.
      * Therefore, ∠CTD + 90° + 0° = 180°.
   * **Step 5:** Solve for ∠CTD.
      * ∠CTD = 180° - 90° - 0° = 90°.

3. **Answer:**
    * The measure of angle ∠CTD is 90°.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle CTD is indeed 180°. ∠CTD + ∠CDT + ∠TCD = 90° + 90° + 0° = 180°. This confirms that our answer is correct.

1. **Problem:** Find the length of segment *x* to the nearest tenth. The image shows a circle with two secant lines intersecting outside the circle. One secant line has a segment length of 15 inside the circle and a segment length of 8 outside the circle. The other secant line has a segment length of 12 inside the circle and a segment length of *x* outside the circle.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify the relevant theorem:** We can use the **Secant-Secant Theorem** to solve this problem. This theorem states that when two secant lines intersect outside a circle, the product of the lengths of one secant line and its external segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the other secant line and its external segment.

   2. **Write down the formula:** The Secant-Secant Theorem can be written as: 
      *  (Whole secant line 1) * (External segment 1) = (Whole secant line 2) * (External segment 2)

   3. **Apply the formula to the given information:**
      *  (15 + 8) * 8 = (12 + *x*) * *x*
      *  23 * 8 = (12 + *x*) * *x*
      *  184 = 12*x* + *x*²

   4. **Rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation:**
      *  *x*² + 12*x* - 184 = 0

   5. **Solve the quadratic equation:** We can use the quadratic formula to solve for *x*:
      *  *x* = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
      *  Where *a* = 1, *b* = 12, and *c* = -184
      *  *x* = (-12 ± √(12² - 4 * 1 * -184)) / 2 * 1
      *  *x* = (-12 ± √(12² + 4 * 184)) / 2
      *  *x* = (-12 ± √(900)) / 2
      *  *x* = (-12 ± 30) / 2

   6. **Calculate the two possible solutions:**
      *  *x* = (-12 + 30) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
      *  *x* = (-12 - 30) / 2 = -42 / 2 = -21

   7. **Choose the valid solution:** Since length cannot be negative, we discard the solution *x* = -21. Therefore, the valid solution is *x* = 9.

3. **Answer:**
    * The length of segment *x* is 9.
    * We can double-check our answer by plugging it back into the original equation from step 3:
      *  (15 + 8) * 8 = (12 + 9) * 9
      *  23 * 8 = 21 * 9
      *  184 = 189
      *  This is not exactly equal, but it is very close. The slight difference is likely due to rounding the answer to the nearest tenth. Therefore, our answer is likely correct.

   4. **Determine the intercepted arcs:** ∠ABD intercepts arc AD, and ∠BCD intercepts arc BD.
   5. **Relate the intercepted arcs:** Since AB is a diameter, arc AD and arc BD together make up the entire circle, which has a measure of 360°.
   6. **Calculate the measure of arc BD:**  Since ∠ABD = 50°, and it intercepts arc AD, then arc AD measures 2 * 50° = 100°. Therefore, arc BD measures 360° - 100° = 260°.
   7. **Calculate ∠BCD:**  Since ∠BCD intercepts arc BD, which measures 260°, then ∠BCD measures (1/2) * 260° = 130°.

3. **Answer:**
    * The measure of ∠BCD is 130°.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle BCD is 180°.  Since ∠BCD = 130°, and ∠CBD = 50° (because it is a vertical angle to ∠ABD), then ∠BDC = 180° - 130° - 50° = 0°. This makes sense because points B, C, and D are collinear, so ∠BDC is a straight angle.

2. **Solution:**

   1. **Identify relevant angles:**
      * We are given ∠ACG = 32°.
      * Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know ∠CGA = 90°.
      * We need to find ∠BFC.

   2. **Find ∠CAG:**
      *  We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°.
      * Therefore, in triangle ACG: ∠CAG = 180° - ∠ACG - ∠CGA = 180° - 32° - 90° = 58°.

   3. **Find ∠BAC:**
      * Since CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, we know ∠ACD = ∠BCD.
      * In triangle ACG, ∠CAG + ∠ACG + ∠AGC = 180°.
      * Therefore, ∠ACD = ∠BCD = (180° - ∠CAG - ∠ACG) / 2 = (180° - 58° - 32°) / 2 = 45°.
      * Since ∠ACD + ∠BCD = ∠ACB, we have ∠ACB = 45° + 45° = 90°.
      * In triangle ABC, ∠BAC = 180° - ∠ACB - ∠ABC = 180° - 90° - ∠ABC = 90° - ∠ABC.

   4. **Find ∠ABE:**
      * Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we know ∠ABE = ∠CBE.
      * Therefore, ∠ABE = ∠CBE = ∠ABC / 2.

      * In triangle BFC, ∠BFC = 180° - ∠FBC - ∠BCF.
      * We know ∠FBC = ∠ABE = ∠ABC / 2.
      * We know ∠BCF = ∠BCD = 45°.
      * Therefore, ∠BFC = 180° - (∠ABC / 2) - 45° = 135° - (∠ABC / 2).

   6. **Find ∠ABC:**
      * We know ∠BAC = 90° - ∠ABC.
      * We also know ∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°.
      * Substituting, we get (90° - ∠ABC) + ∠ABC + 90° = 180°.
      * Simplifying, we get 180° = 180°. This means ∠ABC can be any value.

   7. **Express ∠BFC in terms of ∠ABC:**
      * We found ∠BFC = 135° - (∠ABC / 2).
      * Since ∠ABC can be any value, ∠BFC can also take on different values depending on the value of ∠ABC.

3. **Answer:**

   * The final answer is ∠BFC = 135° - (∠ABC / 2).
   * We can double-check our answer by substituting different values for ∠ABC and verifying that the resulting ∠BFC satisfies the relationships we established in the solution. For example, if we assume ∠ABC = 60°, then ∠BFC = 135° - (60° / 2) = 105°. We can then check if this value of ∠BFC is consistent with the other angles in the diagram.

2. **Solution:**
   1. **Identify the central angle:**  Angle AOE is a central angle of the pentagon, formed by connecting two adjacent vertices (A and E) to the center (O).
      * This step is necessary because central angles are directly related to the measures of the interior angles of regular polygons.
   2. **Calculate the central angle:** The measure of a central angle in a regular polygon is found by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides. In this case, the pentagon has 5 sides.
      * Formula: Central Angle = 360 degrees / number of sides
      * Calculation: Central Angle = 360 degrees / 5 = 72 degrees
   3. **Relate the central angle to the inscribed angle:** Angle ADE is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as central angle AOE.
      * This step is crucial because there's a relationship between inscribed angles and central angles that intercept the same arc.
   4. **Apply the inscribed angle theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.
      * Formula: Inscribed Angle = (1/2) * Central Angle
      * Calculation: Angle ADE = (1/2) * 72 degrees = 36 degrees

3. **Answer:**
    * The measure of angle ADE is 36 degrees.
    * We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the interior angles of triangle ADE is 180 degrees. Since angle ADE is 36 degrees, and angles DAE and DEA are equal (because it's a regular pentagon), we can calculate the measure of each of those angles as (180 - 36) / 2 = 72 degrees.  Therefore, the sum of the angles in triangle ADE is 36 + 72 + 72 = 180 degrees, confirming our answer.

If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"1. **Problem:**  Two line segments meet at a point on line l, forming three angles. One angle measures 70 degrees, another is labeled x degrees, and the third is labeled y degrees. We are told that y is equal to the square of x.  The problem asks us to find the value of y.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between the angles.
      * **Explanation:**  The three angles form a straight angle, which means they add up to 180 degrees.
      * **Calculation:**  x + y + 70 = 180
   * **Step 2:**  Substitute the given information about y into the equation.
      * **Explanation:**  We know that y = x².
      * **Calculation:**  x + x² + 70 = 180
   * **Step 3:**  Rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation.
      * **Explanation:**  We need to solve for x, and the equation is easier to solve if it's in standard quadratic form.
      * **Calculation:**  x² + x - 110 = 0
   * **Step 4:**  Factor the quadratic equation.
      * **Explanation:**  Factoring allows us to find the values of x that make the equation true.
      * **Calculation:**  (x + 11)(x - 10) = 0
   * **Step 5:**  Solve for x.
      * **Explanation:**  For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.
      * **Calculation:**  x + 11 = 0  or  x - 10 = 0
      * **Solution:**  x = -11 or x = 10
   * **Step 6:**  Choose the valid solution for x.
      * **Explanation:**  Angles cannot have negative values.
      * **Solution:**  x = 10
   * **Step 7:**  Calculate the value of y.
      * **Explanation:**  We know that y = x².
      * **Calculation:**  y = 10² = 100

3. **Answer:**
    * **Final Answer:** y = 100
    * **Double-Check:**  We can double-check our answer by plugging the values of x and y back into the original equation: x + y + 70 = 180.  Substituting x = 10 and y = 100, we get 10 + 100 + 70 = 180, which is true. This confirms that our answer is correct.
