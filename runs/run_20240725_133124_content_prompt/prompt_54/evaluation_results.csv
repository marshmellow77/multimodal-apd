The image shows a circle with center O, diameter CD, and chords DE and OA. We are given that DE is parallel to OA and that angle D measures 50 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle C.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
    * We are given that DE || OA. This means that angle D and angle A are corresponding angles and therefore congruent. 
    * Since CD is a diameter, angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.
    * Angle CDO is half of angle COD because it is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as angle COD.

* **Step 2: Calculate the measure of angle A.**
    * Since angle D and angle A are corresponding angles and angle D measures 50 degrees, angle A also measures 50 degrees.

* **Step 3: Calculate the measure of angle CDO.**
    * Angle COD measures 180 degrees, and angle CDO is half of angle COD. Therefore, angle CDO measures 180/2 = 90 degrees.

* **Step 4: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**
    * In triangle CDO, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees. We know that angle CDO measures 90 degrees and angle D measures 50 degrees. Therefore, angle C measures 180 - 90 - 50 = 40 degrees.

The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees. The length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle is 4, and the length of the hypotenuse is represented by the variable *h*. The problem asks us to find the value of *h*.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio.**
    * We know the length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle (4) and we want to find the length of the hypotenuse (*h*). 
    * The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function:  sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse.

* **Step 2: Apply the sine function.**
    * In this case, sin(60°) = 4/ *h*.

* **Step 3: Solve for *h*.**
    * Multiply both sides of the equation by *h*: *h* * sin(60°) = 4.
    * Divide both sides by sin(60°): *h* = 4 / sin(60°).

* **Step 4: Calculate the value of sin(60°) and simplify.**
    * sin(60°) = √3/2.
    * Substitute this value into the equation: *h* = 4 / (√3/2).
    * Simplify by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2: *h* = 8/√3.

* **Step 5: Rationalize the denominator.**
    * Multiply the numerator and denominator by √3: *h* = (8/√3) * (√3/√3) = 8√3 / 3.

The image shows two intersecting lines, AB and CD, forming four angles.  One of the angles, ∠AOD, is labeled as 70°.  A ray OE is drawn bisecting ∠BOC.  The problem asks us to find the measure of ∠AOE.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between ∠AOD and ∠BOC.**
    *  ∠AOD and ∠BOC are vertical angles, meaning they are opposite angles formed by the intersection of two lines.
    *  Vertical angles are always congruent (equal in measure).
    *  Therefore, ∠BOC = ∠AOD = 70°.

* **Step 2: Understand the concept of angle bisector.**
    *  A ray that bisects an angle divides it into two congruent angles.
    *  Since OE bisects ∠BOC, we have ∠BOE = ∠COE = (1/2)∠BOC.

* **Step 3: Calculate the measure of ∠BOE.**
    *  We know ∠BOC = 70°.
    *  Therefore, ∠BOE = (1/2) * 70° = 35°.

* **Step 4: Determine the relationship between ∠AOE and ∠BOE.**
    *  ∠AOE and ∠BOE are adjacent angles, meaning they share a common side (OE) and a common vertex (O).
    *  The sum of adjacent angles on a straight line is always 180°.
    *  Therefore, ∠AOE + ∠BOE = 180°.

* **Step 5: Solve for ∠AOE.**
    *  We know ∠BOE = 35°.
    *  Substituting into the equation from Step 4: ∠AOE + 35° = 180°.

The image shows a square with four charged particles at its corners. The problem asks us to calculate the x-component of the net electrostatic force acting on particle 3, which is located at the bottom left corner of the square. We are given the charges of each particle, the distance between them (denoted by 'a'), and the coordinates of each particle.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**
    * Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to the other three particles: particle 1, particle 2, and particle 4.
    * We need to consider the direction of each force. 
    * The force between particle 3 and particle 1 is attractive (opposite charges) and acts along the diagonal of the square.
    * The force between particle 3 and particle 2 is repulsive (same charges) and acts horizontally to the right.
    * The force between particle 3 and particle 4 is repulsive (same charges) and acts vertically upwards.

* **Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of each force using Coulomb's Law.**
    * Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
    * Formula: F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
        * F is the electrostatic force
        * k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
        * q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges
        * r is the distance between the charges

    * Force between particle 3 and particle 1:
        * F31 = k * |q3 * q1| / (a√2)^2  (distance between 3 and 1 is a√2, the diagonal of the square)
    * Force between particle 3 and particle 2:
        * F32 = k * |q3 * q2| / a^2
    * Force between particle 3 and particle 4:
        * F34 = k * |q3 * q4| / a^2

* **Step 3: Resolve each force into its x and y components.**
    * The force between particle 3 and particle 2 is entirely in the x-direction.
    * The force between particle 3 and particle 4 is entirely in the y-direction.
    * The force between particle 3 and particle 1 needs to be resolved into its x and y components.
        * The angle between the force F31 and the x-axis is 45 degrees.
        * x-component of F31: F31x = F31 * cos(45°)
        * y-component of F31: F31y = F31 * sin(45°)

* **Step 4: Sum the x-components of all forces to find the net x-component of the force on particle 3.**
    * Net force in x-direction: Fnetx = F32 + F31x

* **Step 5: Substitute the values and calculate the final answer.**
    * Substitute the given values for charges (q1, q2, q3, q4), distance (a), and Coulomb's constant (k) into the equations from Step 2 and Step 3.
    * Calculate the x-components of each force.
    * Add the x-components to find the net x-component of the force on particle 3.

**3. Answer:**

After substituting the values and performing the calculations, the final answer for the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is approximately **1.80 x 10^-2 N**.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio.**
    * We know the lengths of the opposite side (9) and the hypotenuse (14) of the triangle. 
    * The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function:  sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse.

* **Step 2: Set up the equation.**
    * We can write the equation: sin(∠J) = 9/14.

* **Step 3: Solve for ∠J using the inverse sine function.**
    * To find the angle, we need to use the inverse sine function (arcsin or sin⁻¹).
    * ∠J = arcsin(9/14)

* **Step 4: Calculate the angle using a calculator.**
    * Using a calculator, we find that arcsin(9/14) ≈ 40.04°.

The image shows a 4x4 grid with each square having a side length of 1 unit.  Points A, B, and C are located at grid points, forming a triangle ABC.  A perpendicular line segment AD is drawn from point A to line BC, creating a right angle at point D. The problem asks us to find the length of line segment AD.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant triangles.**
    * We can see that triangle ABC is a right triangle, with the right angle at point B.
    * Triangle ABD is also a right triangle, with the right angle at point D.

* **Step 2: Determine the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC.**
    * By counting the grid squares, we can see that AB has a length of 4 units and BC has a length of 3 units.

* **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle ABC.**
    * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
    * In triangle ABC, AC is the hypotenuse.  Therefore, we can write: AC² = AB² + BC²
    * Substituting the known values: AC² = 4² + 3² = 16 + 9 = 25
    * Taking the square root of both sides: AC = √25 = 5 units

* **Step 4: Determine the length of BD.**
    * Since AD is perpendicular to BC, we know that triangle ABD is similar to triangle ABC.  This means that the corresponding sides of the two triangles are proportional.
    * Therefore, we can write the proportion: BD/BC = AB/AC
    * Substituting the known values: BD/3 = 4/5
    * Solving for BD: BD = (3 * 4) / 5 = 12/5 units

* **Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle ABD.**
    * We know that AB = 4 units and BD = 12/5 units.  We want to find AD.
    * Using the Pythagorean Theorem: AD² = AB² - BD²
    * Substituting the known values: AD² = 4² - (12/5)² = 16 - 144/25 = 196/25

   * **Formula:**  PC * CA = CD² and PD * DB = CD²
   * **Image Reference:**  We are applying the tangent-secant theorem to the segments PC, CA, PD, DB, and CD.

The image shows two similar figures, a smaller quadrilateral labeled ""Q"" and a larger quadrilateral labeled ""Q'"". The problem asks us to find the scale factor from Q to Q'.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify Corresponding Sides:**
    * We need to find the corresponding sides of the two quadrilaterals. Corresponding sides are sides that occupy the same relative position in each figure.
    * In the image, the side of Q with length 5 corresponds to the side of Q' with length x.

* **Step 2: Define Scale Factor:**
    * The scale factor is the ratio of the length of a side in the larger figure to the length of the corresponding side in the smaller figure.
    * In this case, the scale factor is the ratio of the length of the side of Q' (x) to the length of the corresponding side of Q (5).

* **Step 3: Use the Given Information:**
    * The image also shows that the distance between Q and Q' is 15. This means that the side of Q' is 15 units longer than the corresponding side of Q.
    * Therefore, we can write the equation: x = 5 + 15

The image shows a triangle JLN with an incenter Q. We are given the length of side JL as 16.5 and need to find the length of segment JQ.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Incenter**
   * The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. 
   * The incenter is also the center of the inscribed circle of the triangle, which means it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.

* **Step 2: Identify Relevant Triangles**
   * Focus on triangle JQN.  We know that JQ is the inradius of triangle JLN, and it is also the altitude of triangle JQN.

* **Step 3: Apply the Inradius Formula**
   * The inradius (r) of a triangle is calculated using the formula:  r = (Area of triangle) / (Semiperimeter of triangle)
   * In this case, we need to find the area and semiperimeter of triangle JLN.

* **Step 4: Calculate the Area of Triangle JLN**
   * We need more information to calculate the area of triangle JLN.  We can't directly use the given side length JL.  We need to find the length of the altitude from N to JL.  Let's call this altitude h.

* **Step 5: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**
   * Notice that triangle NLM is a right triangle with NM = 9.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of NL:  NL² = NM² + ML²
   * We need to find ML.  Since Q is the incenter, QM is also an inradius of triangle JLN.  Therefore, QM = JQ.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem again to find ML:  ML² = MQ² + QL²

* **Step 6: Calculate the Semiperimeter of Triangle JLN**
   * The semiperimeter (s) of a triangle is half the perimeter:  s = (JL + LN + NJ) / 2

* **Step 7: Calculate the Inradius (JQ)**
   * Now that we have the area and semiperimeter of triangle JLN, we can use the inradius formula to find JQ.

**3. Answer:**

Unfortunately, we cannot complete the solution without more information.  We need the length of either LN or NJ to calculate the area of triangle JLN and ultimately find JQ.

The image shows a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of side AB. The perpendicular bisector intersects AB at point D and BC at point E.  We are asked to find the perimeter of triangle ABC, given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the properties of a perpendicular bisector.**
    * A perpendicular bisector of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts and is perpendicular to the segment.
    * In this case, since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

* **Step 2: Use the perimeter information to find AC.**
    * The perimeter of triangle ACE is the sum of its sides: AC + CE + AE = 13.
    * We know that AE = AD + DE, and since DE is a perpendicular bisector, DE is also the altitude of triangle ABC. 
    * Therefore, AE = 3 + DE.

* **Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find DE.**
    * Triangle ADE is a right triangle with AD = 3 and AE = 3 + DE.
    * Applying the Pythagorean theorem: AD² + DE² = AE²
    * Substituting the values: 3² + DE² = (3 + DE)²
    * Expanding the equation: 9 + DE² = 9 + 6DE + DE²
    * Simplifying: 6DE = 0, so DE = 0.

* **Step 4: Calculate AC.**
    * Since DE = 0, AE = 3 + DE = 3.
    * Now we can find AC using the perimeter of triangle ACE: AC + CE + AE = 13.
    * Substituting the values: AC + CE + 3 = 13.
    * Therefore, AC + CE = 10.

* **Step 5: Calculate the perimeter of triangle ABC.**
    * The perimeter of triangle ABC is the sum of its sides: AB + BC + AC.
    * We know AB = 6 and AC + CE = 10.
    * Since BC = BE + CE, and BE = BD = 3, we have BC = 3 + CE.

The image shows a parallelogram ABCD with points E and F on side AD. Line BE bisects angle ABC, and line CF bisects angle BCD. Given that AB = 3 and AD = 4, the problem asks us to find the length of line segment EF.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify key properties of the parallelogram.**
    * In a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. Therefore, AD = BC = 4.
    * Opposite angles are also equal. So, ∠ABC = ∠CDA and ∠BCD = ∠DAB.

* **Step 2: Utilize angle bisector properties.**
    * Since BE bisects ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE.
    * Similarly, since CF bisects ∠BCD, we have ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

* **Step 3: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem.**
    * The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides.
    * Applying this to triangle ABE, we get AE/EB = AD/AB = 4/3.
    * Applying this to triangle DCF, we get DF/FC = AD/DC = 4/3.

* **Step 4: Express EF in terms of AE and DF.**
    * Since E and F are points on AD, we have EF = AD - AE - DF.

* **Step 5: Substitute the values and solve for EF.**
    * We know AD = 4, AE = (4/3)EB, and DF = (4/3)FC.
    * Substituting these values into the equation for EF, we get:
        * EF = 4 - (4/3)EB - (4/3)FC
    * Since EB + FC = BC = 4, we can simplify the equation:
        * EF = 4 - (4/3)(4) = 4 - 16/3 = -4/3

**3. Answer:**

The length of EF is **-4/3**. However, a length cannot be negative. This indicates an error in our calculations or an issue with the problem statement. It's important to double-check the given information and the steps taken to identify the source of the error.

The image shows two intersecting lines, AB and CD, at point O.  Line segment OD bisects angle AOE, and angle BOC is given as 50 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle EOB.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand Angle Bisector**
   * The problem states that OD bisects angle AOE. This means that angle AOD is equal to angle DOE. 
   * **Reasoning:** A bisector divides an angle into two equal parts.

* **Step 2: Identify Vertical Angles**
   * Angles BOC and AOD are vertical angles. Vertical angles are formed by two intersecting lines and are always equal.
   * **Reasoning:** Vertical angles are congruent.
   * **Formula:** ∠BOC = ∠AOD

* **Step 3: Calculate Angle AOD**
   * Since ∠BOC = 50 degrees, and ∠BOC = ∠AOD, then ∠AOD = 50 degrees.

* **Step 4: Understand Linear Pair**
   * Angles AOD and DOE form a linear pair. A linear pair is formed by two adjacent angles that share a common side and whose non-common sides form a straight line. The sum of the angles in a linear pair is always 180 degrees.
   * **Reasoning:** Linear pairs are supplementary.
   * **Formula:** ∠AOD + ∠DOE = 180°

* **Step 5: Calculate Angle DOE**
   * We know ∠AOD = 50 degrees. Using the formula for linear pairs, we can find ∠DOE:
      * 50° + ∠DOE = 180°
      * ∠DOE = 180° - 50° = 130°

* **Step 6: Understand Adjacent Angles**
   * Angles DOE and EOB are adjacent angles. Adjacent angles share a common vertex and a common side.
   * **Reasoning:** Adjacent angles share a common side.

* **Step 7: Calculate Angle EOB**
   * Since ∠DOE = 130 degrees and ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 180 degrees (linear pair), we can find ∠EOB:
      * 130° + ∠EOB = 180°
      * ∠EOB = 180° - 130° = 50°

The image shows a trapezoid ABCD with right angles at A and B. We are given the lengths of sides AB, AD, and BC, and we need to find the length of side CD.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the right triangle.**
   *  Notice that triangle ABC is a right triangle because it has a right angle at B.
   *  We know the lengths of AB and BC, which are the legs of the right triangle.

* **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem.**
   *  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs).
   *  In this case, AC is the hypotenuse, and AB and BC are the legs. So, we can write:  AC² = AB² + BC²

* **Step 3: Calculate the length of AC.**
   *  Substitute the given values: AC² = 24² + 16²
   *  Simplify: AC² = 576 + 256 = 832
   *  Take the square root of both sides: AC = √832 ≈ 28.84

* **Step 4: Recognize the relationship between AC and CD.**
   *  Notice that AC and CD are the bases of the trapezoid.
   *  Since AD is a vertical side, we can see that AC + CD = AD.

We are given that the central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees and the central angle of arc CD is 50 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle P.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles.**
    * We need to find ∠P.  
    * Notice that ∠P is an exterior angle of triangle PAB.
    * We know that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. 
    * Therefore, ∠P = ∠PAB + ∠PBA.

* **Step 2: Find ∠PAB.**
    * ∠PAB is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CB.
    * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * The central angle of arc CB is 360° - 90° - 50° = 220°.
    * Therefore, ∠PAB = 220°/2 = 110°.

* **Step 3: Find ∠PBA.**
    * ∠PBA is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AD.
    * The central angle of arc AD is 90° + 50° = 140°.
    * Therefore, ∠PBA = 140°/2 = 70°.

* **Step 4: Calculate ∠P.**
    * ∠P = ∠PAB + ∠PBA = 110° + 70° = 180°.

**3. Answer:**

∠P = 180°. 

This answer makes sense because the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°. Since we found that ∠PAB + ∠PBA = 180°, it follows that ∠P must be 180° to satisfy the triangle angle sum property.

* **Step 4:  Find the length of AM.**
    * We know that MN = 2 and BM is perpendicular to AM.  Therefore, triangle BMN is a right triangle with right angle at M.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of AM:

    * We know that AB/AC = BM/MC.  We can substitute the values we know:
        * 8/AC = √30/MC
        * AC = 8MC/√30

* **Step 7:  Find the length of AC.**
    * We know that N is the midpoint of BC, so BN = NC.  We also know that BM is perpendicular to AM, so triangle BMN is a right triangle.  Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BN:
        * BN² = BM² + MN²
        * BN² = 30 + 2² = 34
        * BN = √34
    * Since N is the midpoint of BC, we have BC = 2BN = 2√34.
    * Therefore, MC = BC - BN = 2√34 - √34 = √34.
    * Finally, we can substitute the value of MC into the equation we found for AC:
        * AC = 8MC/√30 = 8√34/√30 = 8√(34/30) = 8√(17/15)

642,"Line AB is tangent to circle O. If AB = 8 and OB = 10, find the diameter of the circle.",12,"**1. Problem:**

The image shows a circle with center O. Line AB is tangent to the circle at point A. We are given that the length of line segment AB is 8 and the length of line segment OB is 10. The problem asks us to find the diameter of the circle.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the right triangle.**
    *  The line segments OA, AB, and OB form a right triangle. This is because a tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. 
    *  In this case, OA is the radius, AB is the tangent, and OB is the hypotenuse.

* **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.**
    * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. 
    *  Mathematically, this is represented as:  a² + b² = c² where 'c' is the hypotenuse and 'a' and 'b' are the other two sides.
    *  In our triangle, we know:
        *  OB (hypotenuse) = 10
        *  AB = 8
        *  We need to find OA (radius)

* **Step 3: Solve for the radius (OA).**
    *  Using the Pythagorean Theorem: OA² + AB² = OB²
    *  Substitute the known values: OA² + 8² = 10²
    *  Simplify: OA² + 64 = 100
    *  Subtract 64 from both sides: OA² = 36
    *  Take the square root of both sides: OA = 6

* **Step 4: Calculate the diameter.**
    *  The diameter of a circle is twice the length of its radius.
    *  Therefore, the diameter of circle O is 2 * OA = 2 * 6 = 12.

The image shows a right triangle with sides labeled a, b, and c. We are given the lengths of all three sides: a = 14, b = 48, and c = 50. The problem asks us to find the cosine of angle A, denoted as cosA.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant sides.**
    *  We need to find cosA.  Remember that cosine is defined as the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse (SOH CAH TOA). 
    *  In this triangle, angle A is the focus. The adjacent side to angle A is side b (length 48), and the hypotenuse is side c (length 50).

* **Step 2: Apply the cosine formula.**
    *  The formula for cosine is: cos(angle) = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse)
    *  In this case, cosA = b / c

* **Step 3: Substitute the given values.**
    *  We know b = 48 and c = 50. Substitute these values into the formula: cosA = 48 / 50

The image shows a circle with center O and radius 5.0. A chord AB with length 8.0 is drawn within the circle. The problem asks us to find the distance from the center O to the chord AB.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Draw a perpendicular from the center to the chord.**
   * Draw a line segment from point O perpendicular to chord AB, intersecting AB at point M. This line segment represents the distance from the center O to the chord AB.
   * **Reasoning:**  A perpendicular line from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord. This is a fundamental property of circles.

* **Step 2: Identify the right triangle formed.**
   * The line segment OM, half of the chord AB (AM = MB = 4.0), and the radius OA form a right triangle OAM.
   * **Reasoning:** We have a right angle at point M because OM is perpendicular to AB.

* **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem.**
   * The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   * In triangle OAM, OA is the hypotenuse (radius = 5.0), AM is one leg (half the chord = 4.0), and OM is the other leg (the distance we need to find).
   * **Formula:**  OA² = AM² + OM²

The image shows a right triangle ABC with a right angle at C. Point D is the midpoint of the hypotenuse AB, and the length of AB is 10. The problem asks us to find the length of line segment CD.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant geometric properties.**
    * The image shows a right triangle, which means we can apply the Pythagorean theorem.
    * Point D is the midpoint of the hypotenuse, which means it divides the hypotenuse into two equal segments.

* **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem.**
    * The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (AB) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (AC and BC):  AB² = AC² + BC².
    * Since AB = 10, we have 10² = AC² + BC².

* **Step 3: Use the midpoint property.**
    * Since D is the midpoint of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 10/2 = 5.

* **Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ACD.**
    * Triangle ACD is also a right triangle with a right angle at C.
    * Applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ACD, we get: AD² = AC² + CD².
    * Substituting AD = 5, we have 5² = AC² + CD².

* **Step 5: Solve for CD.**
    * We have two equations:
        * 10² = AC² + BC²
        * 5² = AC² + CD²
    * Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get: 10² - 5² = BC² - CD².
    * Simplifying, we get: 75 = BC² - CD².
    * Since BC is half of AB, we have BC = AB/2 = 10/2 = 5.
    * Substituting BC = 5, we get: 75 = 5² - CD².
    * Solving for CD², we get: CD² = 5² - 75 = -50.
    * Since the square of a real number cannot be negative, there is no real solution for CD. This indicates an error in the problem statement or the image.

The image shows a circle with center O, diameter AC, and two tangents PA and PB drawn from an external point P. The angle between the tangents, ∠P, is given as 50 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle ACB, which is formed by the diameter and one of the tangents.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant properties.**
    * **Tangents and radii:**  Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Also, the radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent. This means ∠OAB = ∠OBC = 90 degrees.
    * **Angles in a triangle:** The sum of angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees.

* **Step 2: Analyze the angles formed by the tangents.**
    * Since PA and PB are tangents, we know ∠OAB = ∠OBC = 90 degrees.
    * The angle between the tangents, ∠P, is given as 50 degrees.
    * Therefore, in triangle PAB, we have: ∠PAB + ∠PBA + ∠P = 180 degrees.
    * Since ∠PAB = ∠PBA (tangents are equal), we can write: 2 * ∠PAB + 50 degrees = 180 degrees.
    * Solving for ∠PAB, we get: ∠PAB = (180 - 50) / 2 = 65 degrees.

* **Step 3: Determine the angle ACB.**
    * In triangle OAB, we have: ∠OAB + ∠OBA + ∠AOB = 180 degrees.
    * We know ∠OAB = 90 degrees and ∠OBA = 65 degrees (from Step 2).
    * Therefore, ∠AOB = 180 - 90 - 65 = 25 degrees.
    * Since AC is the diameter, ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the entire circle.
    * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between the diagonals and the area of a rhombus.**
    * The area of a rhombus is calculated by half the product of its diagonals. 
    * Formula: Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
    * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand angle bisectors.**
    *  The problem states that BE bisects angle FBD. This means that angle FBE is equal to angle EBD.
    *  Similarly, CE bisects angle ACD, meaning angle ACE is equal to angle ECD.

* **Step 2: Identify related angles.**
    *  Notice that angle BEC is an exterior angle of triangle BCE. 
    *  The exterior angle theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. 
    *  Therefore, angle BEC = angle BCE + angle CBE.

* **Step 3: Apply the angle bisector property.**
    *  We know that angle BEC = 35 degrees.
    *  Since BE bisects angle FBD, angle CBE = angle EBD.
    *  Similarly, since CE bisects angle ACD, angle BCE = angle ECD.
    *  Therefore, we can rewrite the equation from Step 2 as: 35 degrees = angle ECD + angle EBD.

* **Step 4: Find angle EBD and angle ECD.**
    *  Let's denote angle EBD and angle ECD as x.
    *  From Step 3, we have 35 degrees = x + x = 2x.

    * Since angle M and angle K are formed by the leg KL and the bases, they are supplementary. 
    * Therefore,  $m \angle K + m \angle M = 180^\circ$.
    * We know $m \angle M = 80^\circ$, so we can substitute to get: $m \angle K + 80^\circ = 180^\circ$.

The image shows a circle with center O and three points A, B, and C on the circle. A line segment CD is tangent to the circle at point C, and intersects line segment BC outside the circle. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle CAB, given that angle DCB is 40 degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
    * We are given that ∠DCB = 40°.
    * Since CD is tangent to the circle at C, we know that ∠OCB is a right angle (90°). This is because the radius of a circle is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of tangency.
    * We need to find ∠CAB.

* **Step 2: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**
    * In triangle OCB, we have: ∠OCB + ∠CBO + ∠BOC = 180° (angle sum property of triangles).
    * Substituting the known values: 90° + ∠CBO + ∠BOC = 180°.
    * Therefore, ∠CBO + ∠BOC = 90°.

* **Step 3: Utilize the inscribed angle theorem.**
    * ∠CAB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠BOC.
    * The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * Therefore, ∠CAB = (1/2) ∠BOC.

* **Step 4: Combine the information to solve for ∠CAB.**
    * From Step 2, we know ∠CBO + ∠BOC = 90°.
    * We are given ∠DCB = 40°.
    * Since ∠DCB and ∠CBO are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), we have ∠CBO = 180° - ∠DCB = 180° - 40° = 140°.
    * Substituting this into the equation from Step 2: 140° + ∠BOC = 90°.
    * Solving for ∠BOC: ∠BOC = 90° - 140° = -50°.
    * However, angles cannot be negative. This means that ∠BOC is actually 310° (360° - 50°).

The image shows a parallelogram ABCD with side lengths AB = 6.0 and BC = 9.0, and angle B measuring 30 degrees. The problem asks us to find the area of this parallelogram.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the base and height.**
   * In a parallelogram, any side can be considered the base. Let's choose BC as the base.
   * The height is the perpendicular distance from the opposite side (AD) to the base (BC).  We need to find this height.

* **Step 2: Use trigonometry to find the height.**
   * We can use the sine function in right triangle ABC:
      * sin(∠B) = (height) / (AB)
      * sin(30°) = (height) / 6.0
   * Solving for the height:
      * height = 6.0 * sin(30°)
      * height = 6.0 * (1/2) = 3.0

* **Step 3: Calculate the area of the parallelogram.**
   * The area of a parallelogram is given by:

**3. Answer:**

* The area of parallelogram ABCD is 27.0 square units. 
* We can double-check this by noting that the area of a parallelogram is also equal to the product of its base and the length of the altitude drawn to that base. In this case, the altitude is 3.0 and the base is 9.0, so the area is 3.0 * 9.0 = 27.0 square units.

* **Step 1: Identify the equal sides.**
   * The problem states that triangle ABC is isosceles. This means that two sides of the triangle are equal in length. 
   * From the image, we can see that AB = BC.

* **Step 2: Set up an equation.**
   * Since AB = BC, we can set the expressions representing their lengths equal to each other:
      * 9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5

* **Step 3: Solve for x.**
   * To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
      * Subtract 5x from both sides: 
         * 9x - 1 - 5x = 5x - 0.5 - 5x
         * 4x - 1 = -0.5

The image shows a right triangle ABC with a right angle at A.

The areas of triangles A'BC and AB'C are given as 10 and 4, respectively. The problem asks us to find the area of triangle ABC'.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between the areas of equilateral triangles and their side lengths.**

   * The area of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula: Area = (√3/4) * side² 
   * This formula tells us that the area of an equilateral triangle is directly proportional to the square of its side length.

* **Step 2: Find the side lengths of triangles A'BC and AB'C.**

   * Using the area formula from Step 1, we can solve for the side lengths of triangles A'BC and AB'C:
      * For triangle A'BC: 10 = (√3/4) * side² => side² = 40/√3 => side = √(40/√3)
      * For triangle AB'C: 4 = (√3/4) * side² => side² = 16/√3 => side = √(16/√3)

* **Step 3: Recognize that the side lengths of triangles A'BC and AB'C are also the lengths of sides BC and AC of the right triangle ABC.**

   * This is because the equilateral triangles are constructed on the sides of the right triangle.

* **Step 4: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of side AB.**

   * The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   * In this case, BC is the hypotenuse, and AC and AB are the other two sides.
   * Therefore, AB² = BC² - AC² = (√(40/√3))² - (√(16/√3))² = 24/√3
   * So, AB = √(24/√3)

* **Step 5: Calculate the area of triangle ABC'.**

   * Using the area formula for equilateral triangles from Step 1, we can find the area of triangle ABC':
      * Area of triangle ABC' = (√3/4) * AB² = (√3/4) * (24/√3) = 6

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
    * Since AB is a diameter, angle AEB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem).
    * Since E is the midpoint of FEB, line segment OE bisects chord FEB (a line segment from the center of a circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord).
    * Therefore, angle OEB is also a right angle.

* **Step 2: Apply angle properties.**
    * In triangle OEB, we have two right angles (OEB and OEB), and the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle BOE = 180 - 90 - 90 = 0 degrees. This means that points B, O, and E are collinear.

* **Step 3: Use the given information.**
    * We are given that angle AOF = 40 degrees.

    * Since G is the midpoint of chord EF, we know that line segment OG is perpendicular to chord EF. This is a property of circles: a line segment from the center of a circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.
    * We also know that angle DCF is 20 degrees.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
    * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, angle DCF is an inscribed angle intercepting arc DF. Therefore, the measure of arc DF is twice the measure of angle DCF, which is 2 * 20 degrees = 40 degrees.

* **Step 3: Determine the measure of central angle EOD.**
    * Central angle EOD intercepts the same arc DF as inscribed angle DCF. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, the measure of angle EOD is equal to the measure of arc DF, which is 40 degrees.

The image shows a square inscribed within a circle. The problem asks us to find the measure of a central angle of the circle.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the central angle.**
    * A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. In this case, the central angle is formed by two radii of the circle, connecting the center of the circle (point K, not shown in the image) to two adjacent vertices of the square. 
    * Since the square is inscribed in the circle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square.

* **Step 2: Understand the relationship between the central angle and the square.**

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the equation of the circle.**
    * The equation x² + y² = 25 represents a circle with its center at the origin (0, 0) and a radius of 5. This is because the standard form of the equation of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.
* **Step 2: Visualize the maximum value of y.**
    * The maximum value of y occurs at the point where the circle intersects the y-axis. This is because the circle is symmetrical about the y-axis, and the y-coordinate of the point on the circle farthest from the x-axis will be the maximum value of y.
* **Step 3: Find the y-coordinate of the intersection point.**
    * Since the circle intersects the y-axis at x = 0, we can substitute x = 0 into the equation of the circle:

The image shows a circle with a diameter of 24. A triangle is inscribed in the circle, with one side of the triangle coinciding with the diameter of the circle. The problem asks us to find the length of the side of the triangle labeled 'x'.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant geometric relationships.**
    * The triangle inscribed in the circle has one side that is the diameter of the circle. This means that the triangle is a right triangle, with the diameter as the hypotenuse.
    * We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides of a right triangle:  a² + b² = c², where 'a' and 'b' are the legs of the triangle and 'c' is the hypotenuse.

* **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem.**
    * We know the hypotenuse (c) is 24 and one leg (b) is 9. We need to find the other leg (a), which is represented by 'x'.

The image shows a circle with center O and three points A, B, and C on the circle.  The problem asks us to find the measure of angle BAO, given that angle ACB is 25 degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles ACB and BAO.**
    *  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex lies on the circle and its sides are chords of the circle.
    * Angle BAO is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle and its sides are radii of the circle.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
    *  Since CD is tangent to the circle at C, we know that angle OCB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because a tangent line is always perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
    *  Angle AOB is a straight angle (180 degrees) because AB is the diameter of the circle.

    * We can see that line segment BD is a radius of the circle, and line segment CE is a chord.

* **Step 2: Apply the relationship between the diameter, radius, and chord.**
    * The diameter of a circle is twice the length of its radius.
    * The perpendicular from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord.

* **Step 3: Calculate the length of CD.**
    * Since BD is a radius and AB is a diameter, BD = AB/2 = 8/2 = 4.

    * We are also given that angle AOB is 40 degrees.

* **Step 2: Calculate angle BOC.**
    * Since angle AOB and angle BOC are supplementary, we can find angle BOC by subtracting angle AOB from 180 degrees:

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify key properties of a rhombus.**
    * A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length. This means AB = BC = CD = DA = 5.
    * The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. This means that AO = OC and BO = OD, and angles AOB, BOC, COD, and DOA are all right angles.

* **Step 2: Apply the Midpoint Theorem.**
    * The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
    * In triangle ABD, E and F are the midpoints of AB and AD respectively. Therefore, EF is parallel to BD and EF = 1/2 BD.

* **Step 3: Find the length of BD.**
    * Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BD.

The image shows a triangle with two sides labeled 7 and 12. The problem asks us to determine which of the following options cannot be the perimeter of this triangle.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Triangle Inequality Theorem**

   The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. This theorem is crucial for determining possible perimeters.

* **Step 2: Apply the Theorem to the Given Triangle**

   Let's consider the possible scenarios:

   * **Scenario 1:** If the third side is less than 5 (12 - 7 = 5), the sum of the two shorter sides would be less than the longest side, violating the Triangle Inequality Theorem.

   * **Scenario 2:** If the third side is greater than 19 (12 + 7 = 19), the sum of the two longer sides would be less than the shortest side, again violating the theorem.

* **Step 3: Determine the Range of Possible Perimeters**

   Based on the Triangle Inequality Theorem, the third side of the triangle must be greater than 5 and less than 19. Therefore, the perimeter (sum of all sides) must be greater than 24 (7 + 12 + 5) and less than 38 (7 + 12 + 19).

The image shows a figure composed of a square and an equilateral triangle. The square, ABCE, has an area of 1. We need to find the perimeter of the entire polygon ABCDE.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Find the side length of the square.**
    * The area of a square is calculated by side length squared: Area = side²
    * We know the area is 1, so 1 = side²
    * Taking the square root of both sides, we get side = 1. 
    * Therefore, each side of the square ABCE has a length of 1.

* **Step 2: Find the side length of the equilateral triangle.**
    * Since ABCE is a square, side BC is also 1.
    * The triangle CDE is equilateral, meaning all sides are equal.
    * Therefore, side CD (and DE) also has a length of 1.

* **Step 3: Calculate the perimeter of the polygon.**
    * The perimeter is the total length of all the sides of the polygon.

The image shows a triangle ABC with two internal angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle BOC, given that angle A is 110 degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand Angle Bisectors**
   * Angle bisectors divide an angle into two equal angles.  
   * In this case, OB bisects angle ABC, meaning ∠ABO = ∠CBO.
   * Similarly, OC bisects angle ACB, meaning ∠ACO = ∠BCO.

* **Step 2: Apply the Angle Sum Property of Triangles**
   * The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
   * Applying this to triangle ABC: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.
   * We know ∠A = 110°, so ∠B + ∠C = 180° - 110° = 70°.

* **Step 3: Utilize the Angle Bisector Property**
   * Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, we can express the angles in triangle BOC in terms of the angles of triangle ABC:
      * ∠BOC = 180° - ∠OBC - ∠OCB 
      * ∠OBC = ∠ABC / 2 
      * ∠OCB = ∠ACB / 2

* **Step 4: Substitute and Solve**
   * Substitute the values we know:
      * ∠BOC = 180° - (∠ABC / 2) - (∠ACB / 2)
      * ∠BOC = 180° - (∠B + ∠C) / 2

    *  Angles 1 and 2 are corresponding angles, formed by the transversal line intersecting the parallel lines 'a' and 'b'.
    *  **Corresponding angles are equal.** This is a fundamental property of parallel lines.

* **Step 2: Find the measure of angle 1.**
    *  We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
    *  Therefore, in triangle ABC: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
    *  We are given ∠B = 58° and ∠C = 90°.
    *  Substituting these values: ∠A + 58° + 90° = 180°
    *  Solving for ∠A: ∠A = 180° - 58° - 90° = 32°
    *  Since angle 1 and angle A are alternate interior angles (formed on opposite sides of the transversal line), they are equal.

   * We need to find the location of points M and N on the sides of the quadrilateral that minimizes the perimeter of triangle AMN. This means we need to find the shortest possible path from A to M to N and back to A.

* **Step 2:  Using the Reflection Principle**

   * Reflect point A across line BC to get point A'.  Similarly, reflect point A across line CD to get point A''.
   * The reflection principle states that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Therefore, the shortest path from A to M to N to A is equivalent to the straight line path from A' to M to N to A''.

* **Step 3:  Finding the Minimum Perimeter**

   * The perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized when points M and N coincide with the intersection of line A'A'' and lines BC and CD, respectively.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Find angle ACB.**
    * Since CD bisects angle BCA, we know that angle ACD is equal to angle BCD.
    * We also know that angle A + angle ACB + angle B = 180 degrees (sum of angles in a triangle).
    * Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, angle A is equal to angle D, and angle B is equal to angle F.
    * Therefore, angle ACB = 180 degrees - angle A - angle B = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - angle F.
    * We can find angle F by using the fact that angle CGF + angle F + angle G = 180 degrees (sum of angles in a triangle).
    * So, angle F = 180 degrees - angle CGF - angle G = 180 degrees - 88 degrees - angle G.
    * Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, angle G is equal to angle E.
    * Therefore, angle ACB = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - (180 degrees - 88 degrees - angle E) = 88 degrees + angle E.

* **Step 2: Find angle ACD.**
    * Since CD bisects angle BCA, angle ACD = angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB = (1/2) * (88 degrees + angle E) = 44 degrees + (1/2) * angle E.

* **Step 3: Find angle E.**
    * Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, angle ACD is equal to angle FDE.
    * We also know that angle FDE + angle DEF + angle EFD = 180 degrees (sum of angles in a triangle).
    * Therefore, angle E = 180 degrees - angle FDE - angle EFD = 180 degrees - (44 degrees + (1/2) * angle E) - angle EFD.
    * Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, angle EFD is equal to angle B.
    * Therefore, angle E = 180 degrees - (44 degrees + (1/2) * angle E) - angle B.
    * We can find angle B by using the fact that angle A + angle ACB + angle B = 180 degrees (sum of angles in a triangle).
    * So, angle B = 180 degrees - angle A - angle ACB = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - (88 degrees + angle E) = 70 degrees - angle E.
    * Therefore, angle E = 180 degrees - (44 degrees + (1/2) * angle E) - (70 degrees - angle E).
    * Simplifying the equation, we get (3/2) * angle E = 66 degrees.
    * Solving for angle E, we get angle E = 44 degrees.

The image shows a triangle ABC with points M, N, P, and Q on its sides.  We are given that A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ.  The problem asks us to find the measure of angle PAQ.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand Symmetry**
   *  Symmetry means that if we fold the triangle along the line of symmetry, the two halves will perfectly overlap.
   *  Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, this means that line MP is the perpendicular bisector of line AB.  
   *  Similarly, line NQ is the perpendicular bisector of line AC.

* **Step 2: Identify Key Angles**
   *  Since MP is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP = 90°.
   *  Similarly, since NQ is the perpendicular bisector of AC, we know that ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ = 90°.

* **Step 3: Apply Angle Properties**
   *  The angles around point A add up to 360°.  Therefore, we can write:
      * ∠BAC + ∠PAQ + ∠QAN = 360°
   *  We are given that ∠BAC = 110°.  
   *  From Step 2, we know that ∠QAN = 90°.

* **Step 4: Solve for ∠PAQ**
   *  Substitute the known values into the equation from Step 3:
      * 110° + ∠PAQ + 90° = 360°
   *  Simplify the equation:
      * ∠PAQ + 200° = 360°
   *  Solve for ∠PAQ:
      * ∠PAQ = 360° - 200° = 160°

The image shows a circle with two chords intersecting inside the circle. One chord is labeled with an angle measure of 83 degrees, and the other chord is labeled with an angle measure of (2x - 27) degrees. We are given that the segments of the chords are congruent, meaning they have the same length. The problem asks us to find the value of x.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1:** Identify the relevant theorem.

   * The image shows two chords intersecting inside a circle. The theorem that applies to this situation is the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**. This theorem states that when two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of each angle formed is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

* **Step 2:** Apply the Intersecting Chords Theorem to the given information.

   * The angle measure of 83 degrees intercepts an arc that we can call arc GH.
   * The angle measure of (2x - 27) degrees intercepts an arc that we can call arc KJ.
   * According to the Intersecting Chords Theorem, we can write the following equation: 
      * 83° = (1/2) * (arc GH + arc KJ)

* **Step 3:** Use the given information about congruent segments to find the relationship between the intercepted arcs.

   * We are given that $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$. This means that arc CH and arc KJ have the same measure.

* **Step 4:** Substitute the relationship between the arcs into the equation from Step 2.

   * Since arc CH and arc KJ have the same measure, we can substitute arc KJ for arc CH in the equation:
      * 83° = (1/2) * (arc GH + arc KJ)
      * 83° = (1/2) * (arc GH + arc CH)

* **Step 5:** Recognize that arc GH and arc CH together make up the entire circle.

   * The measure of a full circle is 360 degrees. Therefore, we can write:
      * arc GH + arc CH = 360°

* **Step 6:** Substitute the value of arc GH + arc CH into the equation from Step 4.

   * 83° = (1/2) * (360°)
   * 83° = 180°

* **Step 7:** Solve for x.

   * 83° = (1/2) * (2x - 27)° + 180°
   * 83° = x - 13.5° + 180°
   * 83° = x + 166.5°
   * x = -83.5°

**3. Answer:**

The final solution is x = -83.5°. However, this answer doesn't make sense in the context of the problem because angles cannot have negative measures. This indicates that there might be an error in the problem statement or the image.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the properties of an equilateral triangle.**
   * An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal in length.
   * This means that QR = QS = RS.

* **Step 2: Set up an equation using the given side lengths.**
   * Since QR = QS, we can write the equation: 4x = 6x - 1.

* **Step 3: Solve for x.**
   * Subtract 4x from both sides of the equation: 0 = 2x - 1.
   * Add 1 to both sides: 1 = 2x.
   * Divide both sides by 2: x = 1/2.

* **Step 4: Substitute the value of x into the expression for RS.**
   * RS = 2x + 1.
   * Substitute x = 1/2: RS = 2(1/2) + 1.

* **Step 5: Simplify the expression.**
   * RS = 1 + 1.
   * RS = 2.

**3. Answer:**

The length of side RS is **2**. 

We can double-check our answer by substituting x = 1/2 into the expressions for QR and QS:

* QR = 4x = 4(1/2) = 2.
* QS = 6x - 1 = 6(1/2) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2.

Since QR = QS = RS = 2, our answer is correct. The triangle is indeed equilateral.

The image shows two parallel lines, l1 and l2, with a triangle placed between them. The triangle has a right angle and a 30-degree angle. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle 2, which is formed by the triangle and line l1. We are given that angle 1, formed by the triangle and line l2, measures 76 degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles 1 and 2.**
    *  Angles 1 and 2 are corresponding angles because they are on the same side of the transversal (the line that intersects the parallel lines) and in corresponding positions relative to the parallel lines.
    * **Reasoning:** Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal intersects two parallel lines. They occupy the same relative position at each intersection.

* **Step 2: Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate.**
    * The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the corresponding angles are congruent (equal in measure).
    * **Formula:** ∠1 = ∠2
    * **Reasoning:** Since l1 and l2 are parallel, and angle 1 and angle 2 are corresponding angles, they must have the same measure.

The image shows a circle with two chords intersecting inside the circle. One of the angles formed by the intersection is labeled as (4x + 50) degrees.  Another angle formed by the intersection is labeled as 3x degrees.  A third angle outside the circle is labeled as 30 degrees.  The problem asks us to find the value of x.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**
    * The problem involves angles formed by intersecting chords inside a circle.  The relevant theorem is the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**, which states that the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

* **Step 2: Apply the Intersecting Chords Theorem to the angle inside the circle.**
    * The angle inside the circle labeled (4x + 50) degrees intercepts two arcs.  One arc is the arc between the two chords, and the other arc is the remaining portion of the circle.  Let's call the measure of the smaller arc 'a' and the measure of the larger arc 'b'.  According to the Intersecting Chords Theorem:
        * (4x + 50) = (1/2)(a + b)

* **Step 3: Apply the Intersecting Chords Theorem to the angle outside the circle.**
    * The angle outside the circle labeled 30 degrees also intercepts the same two arcs (a and b).  According to the Intersecting Chords Theorem:
        * 30 = (1/2)(b - a)

* **Step 4: Solve the system of equations.**
    * We now have two equations with two unknowns (a and b):
        * (4x + 50) = (1/2)(a + b)
        * 30 = (1/2)(b - a)
    * We can solve for 'a' and 'b' by adding the two equations together:
        * (4x + 50) + 30 = (1/2)(a + b) + (1/2)(b - a)
        * 4x + 80 = b
    * Substitute this value of 'b' into either of the original equations to solve for 'a':
        * 30 = (1/2)(4x + 80 - a)
        * 60 = 4x + 80 - a
        * a = 4x + 20
    * Now we have expressions for both 'a' and 'b' in terms of 'x'.

* **Step 5: Use the angle formed by the intersecting chords to solve for x.**
    * We know that the angle inside the circle labeled (4x + 50) degrees is equal to half the sum of the intercepted arcs:
        * (4x + 50) = (1/2)(a + b)
    * Substitute the expressions we found for 'a' and 'b':
        * (4x + 50) = (1/2)(4x + 20 + 4x + 80)
        * (4x + 50) = (1/2)(8x + 100)
        * 4x + 50 = 4x + 50
    * This equation is true for any value of x.  This means that the angle labeled (4x + 50) degrees is not helpful in solving for x.

* **Step 6: Use the angle outside the circle to solve for x.**
    * We know that the angle outside the circle labeled 30 degrees is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs:
        * 30 = (1/2)(b - a)
    * Substitute the expressions we found for 'a' and 'b':
        * 30 = (1/2)(4x + 80 - (4x + 20))
        * 30 = (1/2)(60)
        * 30 = 30
    * This equation is also true for any value of x.  This means that the angle labeled 30 degrees is not helpful in solving for x.

* **Step 7: Use the angle labeled 3x degrees to solve for x.**
    * The angle labeled 3x degrees is adjacent to the angle labeled 30 degrees.  These two angles form a linear pair, which means they add",False,0,8.852261066436768,1478.0

The image shows an isosceles right triangle with sides of length 'a'. The problem asks us to find the y-coordinate of the triangle's center of mass.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the concept of the center of mass.**
    * The center of mass of an object is the point where its entire mass can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object like a triangle, the center of mass lies at its geometric center.
* **Step 2: Visualize the triangle's symmetry.**
    * The triangle is symmetrical about the y-axis. This means the center of mass must lie on the y-axis.
* **Step 3: Determine the y-coordinate of the center of mass.**
    * The y-coordinate of the center of mass is simply the average of the y-coordinates of the triangle's vertices.
    * The top vertex has a y-coordinate of 'a', and the two bottom vertices have a y-coordinate of 0.
    * Therefore, the y-coordinate of the center of mass is (a + 0 + 0) / 3 = a/3.

The image shows an infinite chain of resistors, each with a resistance of 'R'. The problem asks us to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b'.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the repeating pattern.**
   * The circuit consists of a repeating pattern of three resistors connected in parallel, followed by one resistor in series. This pattern repeats infinitely.

* **Step 2:  Simplify the repeating pattern.**
   * **Parallel Resistors:** The three resistors in parallel have an equivalent resistance (Rp) calculated using the formula:
      * 1/Rp = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
      * Rp = R/3
   * **Series Resistors:** The equivalent resistance of the parallel combination (Rp) is in series with another resistor (R). The total resistance of this repeating pattern (Rt) is:
      * Rt = Rp + R = R/3 + R = 4R/3

* **Step 3:  Represent the infinite chain as a simplified circuit.**
   * Imagine the infinite chain as a single equivalent resistance (Req) connected between points 'a' and 'b'. This equivalent resistance is equal to the resistance of the repeating pattern (Rt) plus the resistance of the rest of the infinite chain (Req).
   * This can be represented as: Req = Rt + Req

* **Step 4: Solve for the equivalent resistance (Req).**
   * Substitute Rt = 4R/3 into the equation: Req = 4R/3 + Req
   * Subtract Req from both sides: 0 = 4R/3
   * Since R is not zero, this equation has no solution. This means the equivalent resistance (Req) is infinite.

**3. Answer:**

The equivalent resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is **infinite**.

**Double-check:**

The infinite chain of resistors creates a situation where the current has an infinite path to flow. This means the resistance is effectively infinite, preventing any current from flowing through the circuit.

The image shows a rectangle ABCD divided into two identical squares. We are given that the area of each square is 9, and we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle ABCD.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Find the side length of each square.**
   * We know the area of a square is calculated by side length * side length (s * s).
   * Since the area of each square is 9, we have the equation s * s = 9.
   * To find the side length (s), we need to find the square root of 9.
   * The square root of 9 is 3, so the side length of each square is 3.

   * The length of the rectangle is equal to the sum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 3 + 3 = 6.
   * The width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square, which is 3.

* **Step 3: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.**

We are given that angle NCM measures 60 degrees, angle RCL measures (x-1) degrees, and angle LCN measures (3x+5) degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between angles in a circle.**
    * The angles formed by the radii at the center of a circle add up to 360 degrees. This is because they represent the entire circle.
    * We can write this as an equation:  ∠NCM + ∠MCL + ∠LCR + ∠RCN = 360°

* **Step 2: Substitute the given angle measures into the equation.**
    * We know ∠NCM = 60°, ∠LCR = (x-1)°, and ∠LCN = (3x+5)°.  
    * Substituting these values into the equation from Step 1, we get: 60° + ∠MCL + (x-1)° + (3x+5)° = 360°

* **Step 3: Simplify the equation and solve for x.**
    * Combine like terms: 60° + ∠MCL + 4x + 4° = 360°
    * Simplify: ∠MCL + 4x + 64° = 360°
    * Subtract 64° from both sides: ∠MCL + 4x = 296°
    * Since we are looking for ∠NCL, which is the same as ∠MCL, we can rewrite the equation as: ∠NCL + 4x = 296°

* **Step 4:  Solve for ∠NCL.**
    * We need to find the value of x to solve for ∠NCL.  
    * Notice that ∠NCL is also equal to the sum of ∠LCN and ∠RCL: ∠NCL = ∠LCN + ∠RCL
    * Substitute the given values: ∠NCL = (3x+5)° + (x-1)°
    * Simplify: ∠NCL = 4x + 4°
    * Now we have two equations with two unknowns:
        * ∠NCL + 4x = 296°
        * ∠NCL = 4x + 4°
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: (4x + 4°) + 4x = 296°

                                        8x = 292°

The image shows a regular hexagon ABCDEF with point O as its center.  We are asked to find the value of angle x, which is formed by connecting point B to point O.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the properties of a regular hexagon.**
    * A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles.
    * The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is 720 degrees.
    * Therefore, each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.

The image shows a circle with a triangle inscribed inside it.  The problem asks us to find the value of *x* given that two angles of the triangle are expressed in terms of *x*.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant geometric concept.**
    * The image shows a triangle inscribed in a circle.  We need to use the theorem that states: **The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.**

* **Step 2: Apply the theorem to the given angles.**
    * The angle at point *E* intercepts the arc *CD*.  Therefore, the measure of angle *E* is half the measure of arc *CD*.  We can write this as: 
        *  3*x* = (1/2) * measure of arc *CD*

    * The angle at point *C* intercepts the arc *DE*.  Therefore, the measure of angle *C* is half the measure of arc *DE*.  We can write this as:
        * (5*x* - 12) = (1/2) * measure of arc *DE*

* **Step 3: Recognize the relationship between the arcs.**
    * The arcs *CD* and *DE* together make up the entire circle.  Therefore, the sum of their measures is 360 degrees.

* **Step 4: Set up an equation to solve for *x*.**
    * We know that the measure of arc *CD* is twice the measure of angle *E* (3*x*) and the measure of arc *DE* is twice the measure of angle *C* (5*x* - 12).  We can write this as:
        * 2(3*x*) + 2(5*x* - 12) = 360

* **Step 5: Solve the equation for *x*.**
    * Simplify the equation:
        * 6*x* + 10*x* - 24 = 360
    * Combine like terms:
        * 16*x* - 24 = 360
    * Add 24 to both sides:
        * 16*x* = 384
    * Divide both sides by 16:

**3. Answer:**

* The solution to the problem is *x* = 24.
* We can double-check our answer by plugging it back into the original expressions for the angles:

    * Angle *C* = (5*x* - 12) = (5 * 24 - 12) = 108 degrees
    * The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, and 72 + 108 = 180, so our answer is correct.

We are given that the ratio of the lengths of line segments IJ to XJ is equal to the ratio of the lengths of line segments HJ to YJ. We are also given the measure of angle WXJ as 130 degrees and the measure of angle WZG as 20 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle YIZ.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
    * We are given that  m∠WXJ = 130° and m∠WZG = 20°.
    * We need to find m∠YIZ.
    * Notice that ∠WXJ and ∠YIZ are corresponding angles formed by the intersection of line segment GX and the line segment WZ.
    * Corresponding angles are equal when two lines are parallel.

* **Step 2: Determine if lines are parallel.**
    * We are given that  IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. This is the definition of the Side-Splitter Theorem.
    * The Side-Splitter Theorem states that if a line is parallel to one side of a triangle and intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally.
    * Therefore, line segment GX is parallel to line segment WZ.

* **Step 3: Apply the property of corresponding angles.**
    * Since line segment GX is parallel to line segment WZ, we know that corresponding angles are equal.
    * Therefore, m∠YIZ = m∠WXJ = 130°.

The image shows a circle with a point B outside the circle. A line segment connects point B to point A on the circle, and another line segment connects point B to point C on the circle. The problem asks us to find the measure of minor arc AC, represented by 'x', given that the measure of angle ABC is 70 degrees and the measure of major arc ADC is represented by 'y'.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between angles and arcs.**
   * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, angle ABC intercepts arc AC.
   * **Formula:**  ∠ABC = 1/2 * m(arc AC)

* **Step 2: Apply the formula to find the measure of arc AC.**
   * We know ∠ABC = 70°.
   * Substitute this value into the formula: 70° = 1/2 * x
   * Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x: 70° * 2 = x

* **Step 3: Calculate the value of x.**

228,"As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of circle O, DB and DC are respectively tangent to circle O at points B and C. If ∠ACE = 25.0, then the degree of ∠D is ()",50°,"**1. Problem:**

The image shows a circle with center O and diameter AB.  Line segments DB and DC are tangent to the circle at points B and C, respectively.  Angle ACE is given as 25 degrees.  The problem asks us to find the measure of angle D.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
    *  Since DB and DC are tangents to the circle, we know that angles OBC and OCB are right angles (90 degrees). This is because a tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
    *  Angle ACB is an exterior angle of triangle OBC.  Therefore, angle ACB is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles:  ∠ACB = ∠OBC + ∠OCB = 90° + 90° = 180°.
    *  Angle ACE is given as 25 degrees.

* **Step 2: Calculate angle BCD.**
    *  Angle BCD is supplementary to angle ACB, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, ∠BCD = 180° - ∠ACB = 180° - 180° = 0°.

* **Step 3: Apply the Tangent-Tangent Angle Theorem.**
    *  The Tangent-Tangent Angle Theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by two tangents drawn to a circle from an external point is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.
    *  In this case, angle D is formed by tangents DB and DC, and it intercepts arc BC.  Since arc BC is a semicircle (half of the circle), its measure is 180 degrees.
    *  Therefore, ∠D = (1/2) * (180° - 0°) = 90°.

The image shows a square ABCD with a semicircle drawn inside it, tangent to the square at point T.  The problem asks us to find the measure of angle ∠CTD.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify key angles and relationships.**
    *  We know that ∠BTC is a right angle because CT is tangent to the semicircle at point T. 
    *  We also know that ∠ABC is a right angle because ABCD is a square.

* **Step 2: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**
    *  In triangle BTC, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees. 
    *  Therefore, ∠BTC + ∠CBT + ∠CTB = 180°.
    *  Substituting the known values, we get 90° + 45° + ∠CTB = 180°.

* **Step 3: Solve for ∠CTB.**
    *  Combining like terms, we have 135° + ∠CTB = 180°.
    *  Subtracting 135° from both sides, we get ∠CTB = 45°.

* **Step 4: Recognize the relationship between ∠CTB and ∠CTD.**
    *  ∠CTB and ∠CTD are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180°.

* **Step 5: Calculate ∠CTD.**
    *  Since ∠CTB = 45°, we have ∠CTD = 180° - 45° = 135°.

757,Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.,7.2,"**1. Problem:**

The image shows a circle with two secant lines intersecting outside the circle. One secant line has a segment length of 15 inside the circle and a segment length of 12 outside the circle. The other secant line has a segment length of 8 outside the circle and a segment length of *x* inside the circle. The problem asks us to find the value of *x*, rounded to the nearest tenth.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Secant-Secant Theorem**

   The Secant-Secant Theorem states that when two secant lines intersect outside a circle, the product of the lengths of one secant line and its external segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the other secant line and its external segment.  

   * **Formula:**  *a* * ( *a* + *b* ) = *c* * ( *c* + *d* ) 
      * Where:
         * *a* and *b* are the segments of one secant line
         * *c* and *d* are the segments of the other secant line

* **Step 2: Apply the Theorem to the Image**

   * In the image, we have:
      * *a* = 12
      * *b* = 15
      * *c* = 8
      * *d* = *x*

   * Substitute these values into the Secant-Secant Theorem formula:
      * 12 * ( 12 + 15 ) = 8 * ( 8 + *x* )

* **Step 3: Solve for *x***

   * Simplify the equation:
      * 12 * 27 = 8 * ( 8 + *x* )
      * 324 = 64 + 8*x*
   * Subtract 64 from both sides:
      * 260 = 8*x*
   * Divide both sides by 8:
      * *x* = 32.5

**3. Answer:**

* The value of *x* is **32.5** to the nearest tenth. 
* We can double-check our answer by plugging it back into the original equation:
   * 12 * ( 12 + 15 ) = 8 * ( 8 + 32.5 )
   * 12 * 27 = 8 * 40.5
   * 324 = 324

The image shows a circle with center O and diameter AB. Points C and D lie on the circle.  We are given that angle ABD measures 50 degrees and need to find the measure of angle BCD.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships.**
    *  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, angle ACB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem: an inscribed angle that intercepts a diameter is a right angle).
    *  Angle ADB is also a right angle (same reason as above).

* **Step 2: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**
    * In triangle ABD, we have: ∠ABD + ∠ADB + ∠BAD = 180°
    * Substituting the known values: 50° + 90° + ∠BAD = 180°
    * Solving for ∠BAD: ∠BAD = 180° - 50° - 90° = 40°

* **Step 3: Use the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.**
    * In triangle BCD, we have: ∠BCD + ∠CBD + ∠CDB = 180°
    * We know ∠CBD = ∠BAD (both intercept the same arc BD) and ∠CDB = ∠ADB (both intercept the same arc AC).
    * Therefore, ∠BCD + 40° + 90° = 180°

* **Step 4: Solve for ∠BCD.**

The image shows a circle with center S.  A chord PR is drawn, and a diameter QS is drawn perpendicular to PR at point T. The arc PQR measures 98 degrees. We need to find the measure of arc PQ.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**
    * The problem involves a circle, a diameter, and a chord.  We can use the theorem that states:  ""If a diameter of a circle is perpendicular to a chord, then it bisects the chord and its arc.""

* **Step 2: Apply the theorem to the given information.**
    * Since QS is a diameter and is perpendicular to chord PR, it bisects PR and arc PQR. This means that arc PQ is half the measure of arc PQR.

* **Step 3: Calculate the measure of arc PQ.**
    * We know that arc PQR measures 98 degrees.  Therefore, arc PQ measures half of 98 degrees.

**3. Answer:**

* The measure of arc PQ is 98 degrees / 2 = 49 degrees. 
* We can double-check our answer by noting that arc QR also measures 49 degrees, and the sum of the two arcs (PQ and QR) equals the measure of arc PQR (98 degrees).

    * Solving for ∠GAC: ∠GAC = 180° - 32° - 90° = 58°

* **Step 3: Use the angle bisector property.**
    * CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, so ∠ACD = ∠BCD.

* **Step 4: Use the angle sum property of triangles again.**
    * In triangle BFC, we have: ∠BFC + ∠BCF + ∠CBF = 180° (Angle sum property of triangles)
    * We know ∠BCF = ∠BCD = 29°.

The image shows two line segments intersecting at a point on line l, forming three angles. One angle measures 70 degrees, another is labeled x degrees, and the third is labeled y degrees. The problem asks us to find the value of y, given that y is equal to the square of x.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between the angles.**
    * The angles labeled x and 70 degrees form a linear pair, meaning they are adjacent angles that add up to 180 degrees.
    * This is because they share a common side and their non-common sides form a straight line.
    * We can write this relationship as an equation: x + 70 = 180.

* **Step 2: Solve for x.**
