643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Alright, rookie, let's crack this case!

**1. Case File:**

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle C (∠C) in the given circle. We know that CD is the diameter of the circle, chord DE is parallel to OA, and the measure of angle D (∠D) is 50 degrees.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify Key Relationships**

   - **Diameter and Inscribed Angle:**  Since CD is the diameter, angle CAE is an inscribed angle that intercepts the entire circle.  Remember, an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

   - **Parallel Lines and Corresponding Angles:**  Because DE is parallel to OA, we have corresponding angles: ∠D = ∠OAE.

* **Step 2: Apply the Formulas**

   - **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  ∠CAE = 1/2 * 360° = 180° (because it intercepts the entire circle).

   - **Corresponding Angles:** ∠OAE = ∠D = 50°.

* **Step 3: Solve for ∠C**

   - We know ∠CAE = 180° and ∠OAE = 50°.  Therefore, ∠C = ∠CAE - ∠OAE = 180° - 50° = 130°.

**3. The Big Reveal:**

The measure of angle C (∠C) is **130 degrees**. 

We arrived at this answer by using the properties of inscribed angles, parallel lines, and corresponding angles.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"Alright, partner, let's crack this case! 

**1. Case File:** We need to find the length of the hypotenuse, represented by 'h', in a right-angled triangle. We know one angle is 60 degrees, and the side opposite that angle is 4 units long.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio.**  We have the opposite side (4) and need to find the hypotenuse (h). The trigonometric ratio that connects opposite and hypotenuse is the sine function (sin). 

* **Step 2: Write down the formula.** The sine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is equal to the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse.  
    *  sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse

* **Step 3: Plug in the values.** We know the angle is 60 degrees, the opposite side is 4, and the hypotenuse is 'h'. So, we have:
    * sin(60°) = 4 / h

* **Step 4: Solve for 'h'.**  We need to isolate 'h'. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 'h' and then divide both sides by sin(60°):
    * h * sin(60°) = 4
    * h = 4 / sin(60°)

* **Step 5: Calculate the value of sin(60°).**  You can use a calculator or a trigonometric table to find that sin(60°) = √3 / 2.

* **Step 6: Substitute the value and calculate 'h'.**
    * h = 4 / (√3 / 2)
    * h = 8 / √3

* **Step 7: Rationalize the denominator.** To get rid of the radical in the denominator, multiply both numerator and denominator by √3:
    * h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
    * h = 8√3 / 3

**3. The Big Reveal:** The length of the hypotenuse, 'h', is 8√3 / 3 units. 

We solved this case by using the sine function, plugging in the known values, and then solving for the unknown variable 'h'.  Remember, partner, the key is to identify the right trigonometric ratio and apply the formula correctly.

**1. Case File:**

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AOC, given that triangle ABC is inscribed in circle O and angle ABC measures 70 degrees.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1:  Understanding Inscribed Angles**

   An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share a common endpoint on the circle.  The key here is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

* **Step 2: Identifying the Central Angle**

   We need to find the central angle that subtends the same arc as angle ABC.  That central angle is angle AOC.

* **Step 3: Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem**

   The Inscribed Angle Theorem tells us that the measure of angle ABC is half the measure of angle AOC.  We can write this as a formula:

   ∠ABC = (1/2) ∠AOC

* **Step 4: Solving for ∠AOC**

   We know ∠ABC = 70 degrees.  Let's plug that into our formula and solve for ∠AOC:

   70 = (1/2) ∠AOC
   ∠AOC = 70 * 2
   ∠AOC = 140 degrees

**1. Case File:**

The problem asks us to find the radius of the smaller circle, given that the radius of the larger circle is 4 and that both circles share a common line with their centers.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Visualize the Problem:** Imagine the two circles. The larger circle has a radius of 4, meaning the distance from its center (P) to any point on its circumference is 4. The smaller circle's center (Q) lies on the same line as P and a point on the larger circle's circumference (R).

* **Step 2: Identify the Key Relationship:** Notice that the radius of the larger circle (4) is the sum of the radius of the smaller circle and the distance between the centers of the two circles (PQ).

* **Step 3:  Apply the Formula:** We can express this relationship mathematically:

    Radius of larger circle (PR) = Radius of smaller circle (QR) + Distance between centers (PQ)

    Since PR = 4, and PQ is also the radius of the smaller circle (QR), we can rewrite the equation as:

    4 = QR + QR

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify Key Angles:**  We know that angles AOD and BOC are vertically opposite angles.  Vertically opposite angles are always equal. Therefore, angle BOC is also 70 degrees.

* **Step 2: Bisector Property:**  Ray OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides angle BOC into two equal angles.  Let's call each of these smaller angles x.  So, angle BOE = angle COE = x.

* **Step 3: Angle Sum Property:**  The angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.  Therefore, angle AOD + angle BOC + angle BOE + angle COE = 360 degrees.

* **Step 4: Substitute and Solve:**  We know angle AOD = 70 degrees, angle BOC = 70 degrees, and angle BOE = angle COE = x.  Substituting these values into the equation from Step 3, we get:

**1. Case File:**

The math problem we need to solve is:  **Find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.**

We're given:

* Charges of the particles: 
    * q1 = -q2 = 100 nC (nanoCoulombs)
    * q3 = -q4 = 200 nC
* Distance between the particles: a = 5.0 cm (centimeters)

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Visualize the Forces**

   Imagine particle 3. It's being pushed or pulled by the other three particles (1, 2, and 4).  We need to figure out the direction and strength of each force.

* **Step 2: Coulomb's Law**

   The force between two charged particles is described by Coulomb's Law:

   ```
   F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2 
   ```

   Where:
   * F is the force
   * k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
   * q1 and q2 are the charges of the two particles
   * r is the distance between the centers of the two particles

* **Step 3: Calculate the Forces**

   Let's break down the forces acting on particle 3:

   * **Force due to particle 1 (F13):**
      *  q1 = -100 nC, q3 = 200 nC
      *  r = a (distance between particles 1 and 3)
      *  F13 = k * |q1 * q3| / a^2. Since q1 and q3 have opposite signs, the force is attractive, meaning it pulls particle 3 towards particle 1.

   * **Force due to particle 2 (F23):**
      *  q2 = 100 nC, q3 = 200 nC
      *  r = √(2a^2) (distance between particles 2 and 3, using the Pythagorean theorem)
      *  F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / (2a^2). Since q2 and q3 have opposite signs, the force is attractive, pulling particle 3 towards particle 2.

   * **Force due to particle 4 (F43):**
      *  q4 = -200 nC, q3 = 200 nC
      *  r = a (distance between particles 4 and 3)
      *  F43 = k * |q4 * q3| / a^2. Since q4 and q3 have the same sign, the force is repulsive, pushing particle 3 away from particle 4.

* **Step 4: Find the x-component of each force**

   * **F13:**  The force F13 is entirely in the y-direction, so its x-component is 0.

   * **F23:**  The force F23 is at a 45-degree angle to the x-axis.  The x-component of F23 is F23 * cos(45°) = F23 / √2.

   * **F43:**  The force F43 is entirely in the x-direction, so its x-component is F43.

* **Step 5: Add the x-components**

   The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of each individual force:

   *  Net x-component = F13x + F23x + F43x = 0 + F23 / √2 + F43

* **Step 6: Substitute and Calculate**

## 1. Case File:

The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle PCD, given that PA = 8.0 and CD is tangent to circle O.

## 2. Deduction Steps:

**Step 1: Understanding Tangents**

Remember, a tangent line to a circle touches the circle at exactly one point.  The key here is that the tangent line (CD) forms a right angle with the radius of the circle (OE) at the point of contact (E).

**Step 2:  Spotting the Key Relationships**

* **PA = PB:** Since PA and PB are tangents drawn from the same external point (P) to the circle, they are equal in length.
* **∠OEA = ∠OEB = 90°:**  As we discussed, tangents form right angles with the radius at the point of contact.
* **∠AEO = ∠BEO:**  Since OA and OB are radii of the same circle, they are equal. Therefore, triangles OEA and OEB are congruent (by the Hypotenuse-Leg congruence theorem).

**Step 3:  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of OE:

* **OE² + AE² = OA²** 
* Since OA is the radius of the circle, let's assume it's 'r'.
* We know PA = 8, and AE = PA - PE = 8 - r.
* Substituting these values into the equation:  r² + (8 - r)² = r²
* Simplifying the equation: 64 - 16r + r² = 0
* Solving for r: r = 4

**Step 4:  Calculating the Perimeter**

* **PC = PA - AC = 8 - r = 4**
* **PD = PB - BD = 8 - r = 4**

The problem asks us to find the length of line segment $JQ$, given that point $Q$ is the incenter of triangle $JLN$. We know the length of $JL$ is 16.5.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Understanding the Incenter:** The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  It's also the center of the triangle's inscribed circle.

* **Key Property:**  The incenter is equidistant from each side of the triangle. This means the distance from the incenter to each side is the same.

* **Visualizing the Solution:**  Let's draw a line segment from $Q$ to $JL$, making sure it's perpendicular to $JL$.  Let's call the point where this line segment intersects $JL$ point $P$.  Since $Q$ is the incenter, $QP$ is the radius of the inscribed circle.

* **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $QP$.  We know that $QM$ is 9, and $MN$ is also 9 (since $Q$ is equidistant from each side).  Therefore, $QN$ is 18.  Now, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $QPN$:

    * $QP^2 + PN^2 = QN^2$
    * $QP^2 + 9^2 = 18^2$
    * $QP^2 = 18^2 - 9^2$
    * $QP^2 = 243$
    * $QP = \sqrt{243}$

* **Finding JQ:** Now that we know $QP$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem again on triangle $JQP$:

    * $JQ^2 = JP^2 + QP^2$
    * $JQ^2 = 16.5^2 + (\sqrt{243})^2$
    * $JQ^2 = 272.25 + 243$
    * $JQ^2 = 515.25$
    * $JQ = \sqrt{515.25}$

**3. The Big Reveal:**

The final answer is $JQ = \sqrt{515.25} \approx 22.70$.

**Conclusion:**

By understanding the properties of the incenter and applying the Pythagorean Theorem, we successfully cracked the case and found the length of $JQ$.  Remember, partner, the key to solving complex problems is to break them down into smaller, manageable steps.

The image shows a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of AB intersecting AB at point D and BC at point E.  AE is also drawn. We are given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13. The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

## Deduction Steps:

1. **Understanding the Perpendicular Bisector:**  The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line that cuts the segment into two equal parts and forms a right angle with the segment. In our case, since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = 3.

2. **Using the Perimeter Information:** We are given that the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13. This means: AC + CE + AE = 13.

3. **Finding AC:** Since AD = DB = 3 and AB = 6, we know that AC = AE + EC.

4. **Substituting and Solving:**  We can substitute AC in the perimeter equation: (AE + EC) + CE + AE = 13. This simplifies to 2AE + 2CE = 13.

5. **Finding the Perimeter of Triangle ABC:** The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC. We know AB = 6 and AC = AE + EC.  To find BC, we can use the fact that BC = BE + EC.  Since DE is a perpendicular bisector, BE = EC.  Therefore, BC = 2EC.

6. **Putting it all Together:** The perimeter of triangle ABC is 6 + 2EC + (AE + EC).  We know 2AE + 2CE = 13, so 2EC = 13 - 2AE.  Substituting this into the perimeter equation, we get: 6 + (13 - 2AE) + (AE + EC) = 19 - AE + EC.

7. **Final Step:** We don't have enough information to find the exact values of AE and EC, but we can express the perimeter of triangle ABC in terms of AE and EC: **19 - AE + EC**.

## The Big Reveal:

The final answer is **19 - AE + EC**.  We cannot find a numerical answer without more information about the lengths of AE and EC. However, we have successfully expressed the perimeter of triangle ABC in terms of the given information.

The image shows a parallelogram ABCD with diagonals intersecting at point F.  The angle bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCD intersect AD at points E and F respectively. We are given that AB = 3 and AD = 4. The problem asks us to find the length of EF.

## Deduction Steps:

**Step 1: Understanding the Properties of Parallelograms**

* **Opposite sides are equal:** AB = CD and AD = BC.
* **Opposite angles are equal:** ∠ABC = ∠ADC and ∠BAD = ∠BCD.
* **Consecutive angles are supplementary:** ∠ABC + ∠BAD = 180°.

**Step 2: Using Angle Bisectors**

* **Angle bisector definition:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Therefore, ∠ABE = ∠CBE and ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

**Step 3: Identifying Similar Triangles**

* **Angle-Angle Similarity:** If two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, then the triangles are similar.
* **Triangle ABE and Triangle CDE:** ∠ABE = ∠CDE (alternate interior angles), ∠BAE = ∠DCE (alternate interior angles). Therefore, ΔABE ~ ΔCDE.
* **Triangle BCF and Triangle ADF:** ∠BCF = ∠ADF (alternate interior angles), ∠CBF = ∠DAF (alternate interior angles). Therefore, ΔBCF ~ ΔADF.

**Step 4: Using Proportions in Similar Triangles**

* **Similar triangles have proportional sides:** If ΔABE ~ ΔCDE, then AB/CD = AE/DE and BE/CE = AB/CD.
* **Similar triangles have proportional sides:** If ΔBCF ~ ΔADF, then BC/AD = BF/DF and CF/AF = BC/AD.

**Step 5: Solving for EF**

* **Using the proportions:** Since AB = CD = 3 and AD = BC = 4, we can write:
    * AE/DE = 3/3 = 1
    * BF/DF = 4/4 = 1
* **Adding the equations:** AE/DE + BF/DF = 1 + 1 = 2
* **Simplifying:** (AE + BF)/(DE + DF) = 2
* **Substituting:** (AE + BF)/AD = 2
* **Solving for AE + BF:** AE + BF = 2 * AD = 2 * 4 = 8
* **Since EF = AE + BF:** EF = 8

## The Big Reveal:

The length of EF is **8**.

We arrived at this answer by using the properties of parallelograms, angle bisectors, and similar triangles. We identified similar triangles and used their proportional sides to set up equations. By solving these equations, we found the length of EF.

**1. Case File:**

The problem we need to solve is:  Given that lines AB and CD intersect at point O, OD bisects ∠AOE, and ∠BOC = 50 degrees, find the measure of ∠EOB.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

   * We have two lines intersecting at a point, creating four angles.
   * We know one angle (∠BOC) and that OD bisects another angle (∠AOE).
   * Our goal is to find the measure of ∠EOB.

* **Step 2: Using Angle Properties**

   * **Vertical Angles:**  ∠BOC and ∠AOD are vertical angles, meaning they are equal. So, ∠AOD = 50 degrees.
   * **Angle Bisector:** OD bisects ∠AOE, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts. Let's call each of these parts x. So, ∠AOD = x and ∠DOE = x.

* **Step 3: Finding the Missing Angle**

   * We know that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB + ∠BOC = 360 degrees.
   * Substituting the values we know: 50 degrees + x + x + 50 degrees = 360 degrees.

* **Step 4: Solving for x**

   * Combining like terms: 2x + 100 degrees = 360 degrees.
   * Subtracting 100 degrees from both sides: 2x = 260 degrees.
   * Dividing both sides by 2: x = 130 degrees.

* **Step 5: Finding ∠EOB**

   * Since ∠DOE = x, we know ∠DOE = 130 degrees.
   * ∠EOB is the remaining angle around point O, so ∠EOB = 360 degrees - ∠AOD - ∠DOE - ∠BOC.
   * Substituting the values: ∠EOB = 360 degrees - 50 degrees - 130 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees.

**3. The Big Reveal:**

The final answer is ∠EOB = 130 degrees.

**1. Case File:**

We need to find the length of segment CD in trapezoid ABCD. We know that AB = 24, AD = 23, and BC = 16.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Visualize the Trapezoid**
   Imagine the trapezoid. It has two parallel sides (AB and CD) and two non-parallel sides (AD and BC).  Since AB and CD are parallel, we can draw a perpendicular line from C to AD, creating a right triangle. Let's call the point where this perpendicular line intersects AD as E.

* **Step 2: Identify the Right Triangle**
   We now have a right triangle,  CDE, where CE is the height of the trapezoid.  We know that BC = 16 and AB = 24, so AE = AB - BC = 24 - 16 = 8.

* **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
   The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In our triangle CDE, CD is the hypotenuse, DE is one leg, and CE is the other leg.

   The formula is:  CD² = DE² + CE²

* **Step 4: Find DE**
   We know AD = 23 and AE = 8, so DE = AD - AE = 23 - 8 = 15.

* **Step 5: Find CE**
   We know BC = 16 and AB = 24, so CE = AB - BC = 24 - 16 = 8.

* **Step 6: Solve for CD**
   Now we have all the pieces to solve for CD:

   CD² = DE² + CE²
   CD² = 15² + 8²
   CD² = 225 + 64
   CD² = 289

*  PA and PB intersect the circle at points C and D respectively.
*  The central angle of arc AB (⁀AB) is 90 degrees.
*  The central angle of arc CD (⁀CD) is 50 degrees.

## Deduction Steps:

1. **Understanding Central Angles and Inscribed Angles:**  The central angle of an arc is the angle formed by two radii drawn from the center of the circle to the endpoints of the arc. The inscribed angle of an arc is the angle formed by two chords that intersect on the circle, with their endpoints on the arc.

2. **The Inscribed Angle Theorem:** This theorem is crucial for solving this case. It states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

3. **Applying the Theorem:**
    *  Since the central angle of ⁀AB is 90 degrees, the inscribed angle ∠ACB is half of that, which is 45 degrees (90/2 = 45).
    *  Similarly, the central angle of ⁀CD is 50 degrees, so the inscribed angle ∠CPD is half of that, which is 25 degrees (50/2 = 25).

4. **Finding ∠P:**  We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle PBC:
    *  ∠P + ∠PCB + ∠PBC = 180 degrees
    *  ∠P + 45 degrees + 25 degrees = 180 degrees

Partner, we have a classic geometry case on our hands. The image shows a square perfectly inscribed within a circle. We know the area of the circle is 18π square units. Our mission is to find the length of one side of the square. 

## Deduction Steps:

1. **Circle Area:**  We know the area of a circle is calculated using the formula: **Area = πr²**, where 'r' is the radius of the circle. 
    * We're given the area (18π) and need to find the radius. Let's plug in the values: 18π = πr²
    * Divide both sides by π: 18 = r²
    * Take the square root of both sides: √18 = r
    * Simplify the radical: 3√2 = r.  So, the radius of the circle is 3√2 units.

2. **Diagonal of the Square:**  The key to solving this is understanding the relationship between the circle's diameter and the square's diagonal.  The diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the inscribed square. 
    * Since the radius is 3√2, the diameter (and the square's diagonal) is twice that: 2 * 3√2 = 6√2 units.

3. **Side Length of the Square:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length of the square.  The diagonal of the square divides it into two right-angled triangles. The diagonal is the hypotenuse, and the sides of the square are the legs.
    * Pythagorean Theorem: a² + b² = c² (where 'a' and 'b' are the legs, and 'c' is the hypotenuse)
    * In our case, a = b (since it's a square), and c = 6√2.  Let's call the side length 's'.
    * So, the equation becomes: s² + s² = (6√2)²
    * Simplify: 2s² = 72
    * Divide both sides by 2: s² = 36

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1:  Recognize the Key Relationship**

   The key here is that AB is the diameter of the circle. This means that ∠ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

* **Step 2:  Apply the Angle Sum Property of Triangles**

   In triangle ADC, we know ∠ADC = 26 degrees and ∠ACD = 90 degrees (since AC is a radius and CD is a chord, they are perpendicular).  The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.  Therefore:

   ∠CAD + ∠ACD + ∠ADC = 180 degrees
   ∠CAD + 90 degrees + 26 degrees = 180 degrees
   ∠CAD = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 26 degrees = 64 degrees

* **Step 3:  Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem**

   The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  ∠CAB intercepts the same arc as ∠CDB.  Since ∠CDB is a right angle (90 degrees), ∠CAB is half of that:

The image shows a right triangle with sides labeled a, b, and c. We are given the lengths of all three sides: a = 14, b = 48, and c = 50. The problem asks us to find the cosine of angle A, which is written as cosA.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Understanding Cosine:** Cosine is a trigonometric function that relates the angles of a right triangle to the lengths of its sides. Specifically, cosA is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse, with respect to angle A. 

* **Identifying Sides:** In our triangle, the adjacent side to angle A is side b (length 48), and the hypotenuse is side c (length 50).

**1. Case File:**

The problem asks us to find the distance from the center of a circle (point O) to a chord (line segment AB) within that circle. We know the radius of the circle is 5.0 and the length of the chord AB is 8.0.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Visualize the Problem**

   Imagine drawing a perpendicular line from the center of the circle (point O) to the chord (AB). This line will bisect the chord, meaning it will cut it in half. Let's call the point where this perpendicular line intersects the chord point M.

* **Step 2: Identify Key Shapes**

   We now have a right triangle formed by points O, M, and half of the chord (AM or BM).  The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius of the circle (5.0), and one leg is half the length of the chord (8.0 / 2 = 4.0).

* **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

   The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b):  c² = a² + b²

   In our case:
   * c = 5.0 (radius)
   * a = 4.0 (half the chord length)
   * b = the distance from the center to the chord (OM), which is what we need to find.

   So, the equation becomes: 5² = 4² + b²

* **Step 4: Solve for b**

   1. Calculate 5² = 25 and 4² = 16.
   2. Substitute these values back into the equation: 25 = 16 + b²
   3. Subtract 16 from both sides: 25 - 16 = b²
   4. Simplify: 9 = b²
   5. Take the square root of both sides: √9 = √b²

* **Step 1: Identify the Relationship:**  Notice that angles 1 and 2 are on the same side of the transversal line (c) and inside the parallel lines (a and b). These are called **consecutive interior angles**.

* **Step 2: Apply the Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem:** This theorem states that consecutive interior angles formed by parallel lines are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.

* **Step 3: Set up the Equation:** We know ∠1 = 50 degrees. Let ∠2 = x.  Therefore, we have the equation: 50 + x = 180

**1. Case File:**

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle ACB, given that PA and PB are tangents to circle O, AC is the diameter of circle O, and angle P is 50 degrees.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Tangent-Radius Theorem**

   Remember the Tangent-Radius Theorem? It states that a tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  This means that angle OAP and angle OBP are both right angles (90 degrees).

* **Step 2:  Angles in a Triangle**

   We know that the angles inside any triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's look at triangle PAB. We know angle P is 50 degrees, and angles OAP and OBP are both 90 degrees.  Therefore:

   ∠PAB + ∠PBA + ∠P = 180°
   ∠PAB + ∠PBA + 50° = 180°
   ∠PAB + ∠PBA = 130°

* **Step 3:  Inscribed Angle Theorem**

   The Inscribed Angle Theorem tells us that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the entire circle (360 degrees).  Therefore:

   ∠ACB = 1/2 * 360° = 180°

* **Step 4:  Angles on a Straight Line**

   Angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.  Since angle ACB is 180 degrees, and angle PAB + angle PBA = 130 degrees, we can find angle CAB:

   ∠CAB = 180° - (∠PAB + ∠PBA) = 180° - 130° = 50°

* **Step 5:  Angles in a Triangle (Again!)**

   Now, let's look at triangle CAB. We know angle CAB is 50 degrees, and angle ACB is 180 degrees.  Therefore:

   ∠CAB + ∠ACB + ∠CBA = 180°
   50° + 180° + ∠CBA = 180°
   ∠CBA = -50°

   Since angles cannot be negative, we know there's a mistake somewhere.  Let's go back and check our work.

* **Step 6:  The Catch**

   We made a mistake in Step 4.  Angle ACB is not 180 degrees, it's half of that, which is 90 degrees.  This is because AC is the diameter of the circle, and any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

   Let's correct our calculation:

   ∠CAB = 180° - (∠PAB + ∠PBA) = 180° - 130° = 50°

* **Step 7:  Final Calculation**

   Now, we can find angle CBA:

   ∠CAB + ∠ACB + ∠CBA = 180°
   50° + 90° + ∠CBA = 180°
   ∠CBA = 40°

**3. The Big Reveal:**

The final answer is ∠ACB = 90°.  We found this by using the Tangent-Radius Theorem, the Inscribed Angle Theorem, and the fact that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

**1. Case File:**

The image shows a rhombus with one diagonal twice as long as the other. We know the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters. Our mission is to find the lengths of both diagonals.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Rhombus**
    * A rhombus is a special type of parallelogram with all sides equal. 
    * The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. This means they cut each other in half and form four right-angled triangles inside the rhombus.

* **Step 2:  The Area Formula**
    * The area of a rhombus is calculated using the formula:  Area = (1/2) * (diagonal 1) * (diagonal 2)

* **Step 3:  Setting Up the Equations**
    * Let's call the shorter diagonal 'd'. 
    * The longer diagonal is twice the shorter diagonal, so it's '2d'.
    * We know the area is 169 square millimeters.  Let's plug these values into the area formula: 169 = (1/2) * (d) * (2d)

    * A quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon.  The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.  This is a crucial fact for solving our case.

* **Step 2:  Setting up the Equation**
    * We know that the angles of quadrilateral ABCD add up to 360 degrees.  Let's write that down as an equation:
        *  m∠A + m∠B + m∠C + m∠D = 360°
    * We are given that m∠A = 3x°, m∠B = 90°, m∠C = 90°, and m∠D = x°.  Let's substitute these values into our equation:
        * 3x° + 90° + 90° + x° = 360°

* **Step 3:  Solving for x**
    * Now we have an equation with only one unknown, x.  Let's solve for it:
        * 4x° + 180° = 360°
        * 4x° = 180°
        * x° = 45°

* **Step 4:  Finding m∠A**
    * We know that m∠A = 3x°.  Now that we know x = 45°, we can substitute it into this equation:

1. **Parallel Lines and Corresponding Angles:**  Since AB is parallel to CD, we know that angle ABF and angle BDC are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are equal when two lines are parallel. 

2. **Right Angle:** We are given that BD is perpendicular to CF, which means angle CBD is a right angle (90 degrees).

**1. Case File:**

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle CAB, given that angle DCB is 40 degrees and points A, B, and C lie on circle O, with line CD tangent to the circle at point C.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Tangent-Chord Theorem**

   The first clue is that line CD is tangent to the circle at point C.  This means we can use the Tangent-Chord Theorem. This theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

   In our case, the intercepted arc is arc CB.  So, we have:

   ∠DCB = 1/2 * arc CB

   Since ∠DCB = 40 degrees, we can find the measure of arc CB:

   arc CB = 2 * ∠DCB = 2 * 40 degrees = 80 degrees

* **Step 2: Inscribed Angle Theorem**

   Now, let's focus on angle CAB. This angle is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex is on the circle, and its sides are chords of the circle. The Inscribed Angle Theorem tells us that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

   In this case, the intercepted arc for angle CAB is arc CB.  Therefore:

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle OAB, given that angle C is 35 degrees.  We know that points A, B, and C lie on a circle with center O.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify Key Relationships**

   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In our case, angle C is inscribed in the circle and intercepts arc AB.
   * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle AOB is a central angle intercepting arc AB.

* **Step 2: Apply the Theorems**

   * Since angle C is 35 degrees, the measure of arc AB (the intercepted arc) is twice that, or 70 degrees (using the Inscribed Angle Theorem).
   * Angle AOB, being a central angle intercepting the same arc AB, also measures 70 degrees (using the Central Angle Theorem).

* **Step 3:  Find Angle OAB**

   * Triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle because OA and OB are radii of the circle.  Therefore, angles OAB and OBA are equal.
   * The sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.  So, in triangle AOB:  ∠OAB + ∠OBA + ∠AOB = 180 degrees.
   * Since ∠OAB = ∠OBA and ∠AOB = 70 degrees, we have: 2 * ∠OAB + 70 degrees = 180 degrees.
   * Solving for ∠OAB: 2 * ∠OAB = 110 degrees, so ∠OAB = 55 degrees.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understanding Parallelograms**
    * A parallelogram is a four-sided shape where opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
    * The area of a parallelogram is calculated by multiplying the base by the height.

* **Step 2: Finding the Height**
    * We know the base (AB = 6.0).  We need to find the height (the perpendicular distance from side AD to side BC).
    *  Since ∠B = 30.0 degrees, we can use trigonometry to find the height.
    *  Remember the trigonometric function sine (sin): sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse.
    *  In our case, the opposite side is the height, and the hypotenuse is BC.
    *  So, sin(30.0) = height / 9.0
    *  Solving for height: height = 9.0 * sin(30.0) = 9.0 * 0.5 = 4.5

We are given the areas of two of these equilateral triangles: △A'BC with an area of 10 and △AB'C with an area of 4. Our mission is to find the area of the third equilateral triangle, △ABC'.

## Deduction Steps:

1. **Understanding Equilateral Triangles:**  Partner, remember that an equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles equal to 60 degrees. This means that the area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using a simple formula:

   **Area of Equilateral Triangle = (√3 / 4) * side²**

2. **Finding the Sides:**  We need to find the lengths of the sides of the equilateral triangles to calculate their areas. Let's start with △A'BC. We know its area is 10. Using the formula above, we can write:

   10 = (√3 / 4) * BC²

   Solving for BC, we get:

   BC² = (40 / √3)
   BC = √(40 / √3)

3. **Applying the Same Logic:**  We can follow the same process for △AB'C, whose area is 4:

2. **Apply Angle Properties:**  We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°. In triangle AOF, we have:

    ∠AOF + ∠OAF + ∠OFA = 180°

    Since ∠AOF = 40°, we can find ∠OFA:

    ∠OFA = 180° - ∠AOF - ∠OAF = 180° - 40° - ∠OAF = 140° - ∠OAF

3. **Find ∠OAF:**  Notice that ∠OAF and ∠OFC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°) because they form a straight line.  Therefore:

    ∠OAF + ∠OFC = 180°

    We can substitute ∠OFC with ∠OFA + ∠F (since ∠OFC is the sum of these two angles):

    ∠OAF + ∠OFA + ∠F = 180°

    Now, substitute the value we found for ∠OFA:

    ∠OAF + (140° - ∠OAF) + ∠F = 180°

The problem we need to solve is: In a circle, two chords AB and CD intersect at point E. We know that ∠D = 35 degrees, ∠AEC = 105 degrees, and we need to find the measure of ∠C.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**

   - We're dealing with a circle and chords intersecting inside it.  Remember, a chord is a line segment that connects two points on the circle.
   - The angles we're working with are formed by these chords.

* **Step 2:  Key Formula**

   -  **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** This is our key to solving this case. It states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. 

* **Step 3:  Applying the Theorem**

   -  Let's look at ∠D. It's an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC.  
   -  Therefore, the measure of arc AC is twice the measure of ∠D, which is 2 * 35 degrees = 70 degrees.

The length of the diameter is 24, and one of the sides of the triangle is 9.  The other two sides of the triangle are labeled as x and 12.25.  We need to find the value of x.

## Deduction Steps:

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In our case, the hypotenuse is 12.25, and the other two sides are 9 and x.  So, we can write the equation:

   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In our case, angle ACB intercepts arc AB.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**

   * Since angle ACB is 25 degrees, the measure of arc AB is twice that, or 50 degrees.

* **Step 3: Central Angle Theorem**

   * The central angle theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle AOB is a central angle that intercepts arc AB.

* **Step 4: Calculate Angle AOB**

   * Since arc AB is 50 degrees, angle AOB is also 50 degrees.

* **Step 5: Triangle Properties**

   * We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Triangle AOB has angles BAO, ABO, and AOB.

* **Step 6: Solve for Angle BAO**

* AB is the diameter of circle O.
* Line segment CD is a tangent to the circle at point C.
* Angle A (∠A) measures 25 degrees.

## 2. Deduction Steps:

**Step 1: Identify Key Relationships**

* **Tangent-Radius Theorem:**  A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OCB is a right angle (90 degrees).

**Step 2: Apply Angle Properties**

* **Angles on a Straight Line:**  Angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees. So, ∠A + ∠BOC = 180 degrees.
* **Angles in a Triangle:** The angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So, ∠BOC + ∠CBO + ∠BCO = 180 degrees.

**Step 3: Solve for Unknown Angles**

* We know ∠A = 25 degrees.  Therefore, ∠BOC = 180 - 25 = 155 degrees.
* We know ∠CBO = 90 degrees (Tangent-Radius Theorem).
* Now, we can find ∠BCO: ∠BCO = 180 - ∠BOC - ∠CBO = 180 - 155 - 90 = -65 degrees.  However, angles cannot be negative. This means we made an error in our calculations.  Let's go back and check.

**Step 4: Correcting the Error**

* We made a mistake in assuming ∠BOC is an angle inside triangle BOC.  It's actually an exterior angle. 
* **Exterior Angle Theorem:** The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.  Therefore, ∠BOC = ∠CBO + ∠BCO.

**Step 5: Final Calculation**

* We know ∠BOC = 155 degrees and ∠CBO = 90 degrees.  Therefore, ∠BCO = 155 - 90 = 65 degrees.
* Finally, since ∠D and ∠BCO are alternate interior angles formed by a transversal line (CD) intersecting two parallel lines (AB and CD), they are equal.  Therefore, ∠D = ∠BCO = 65 degrees.

* We need to find points M and N on two sides of the quadrilateral to create a triangle AMN with the smallest possible perimeter.

**Step 2:  The Key Insight**

* **The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.** This is a fundamental principle in geometry.
* To minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, we need to minimize the lengths of AM, MN, and AN.

**Step 3:  Applying the Principle**

* **AM:** The shortest distance from A to BC is a perpendicular line from A to BC. Let's call the point where this perpendicular intersects BC as M.
* **AN:** Similarly, the shortest distance from A to CD is a perpendicular line from A to CD. Let's call the point where this perpendicular intersects CD as N.
* **MN:** Now, we have a straight line MN connecting points M and N.

**Step 4:  Analyzing the Triangle**

* We now have triangle AMN with AM and AN being perpendiculars to BC and CD respectively.
* Since ∠BAD = 120°, and ∠BAM and ∠DAN are both right angles, we can deduce that ∠MAN = 120° - 90° - 90° = -60°.
* However, angles cannot be negative. This means that ∠MAN is actually 360° - 60° = 300°.

**Step 5:  The Formula**

* **Angle Sum Property of a Triangle:** The sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180°.
* Therefore, in triangle AMN: ∠AMN + ∠ANM + ∠MAN = 180°

**Step 6:  Solving for the Unknown**

* Solving for ∠AMN + ∠ANM: ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 180° - 300° = -120°

**1. Case File:**

The image shows a set of parallel lines intersected by a transversal. We need to find the value of 'y'.  The angles marked with pink lines are corresponding angles.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Corresponding Angles:**  Remember, corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection of the transversal with the parallel lines. They are always equal. 
* **Setting up the Equation:** Since the angles marked with pink lines are corresponding angles, we can set their measures equal to each other: 
    *  20 - 5x = -y
    *  2x + 6 = -3/5y + 2
* **Solving for x:**  We have two equations with two unknowns (x and y). Let's solve for 'x' first.  We can use the first equation:
    * 20 - 5x = -y
    * 5x = 20 + y 
    * x = (20 + y)/5
* **Substituting x:** Now, let's substitute this value of 'x' into the second equation:
    * 2 * [(20 + y)/5] + 6 = -3/5y + 2
    * (40 + 2y)/5 + 6 = -3/5y + 2
* **Simplifying the Equation:** Let's get rid of the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5:
    * 40 + 2y + 30 = -3y + 10
    * 70 + 2y = -3y + 10
* **Solving for y:** Now, let's isolate 'y' on one side of the equation:
    * 70 - 10 = -3y - 2y
    * 60 = -5y
    * y = -12

The image presents a geometry problem. We need to find the measure of angle E (∠E) in triangle DEF. We are given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF (△ABC≌△DEF), CD bisects angle BCA (CD平分∠BCA), angle A is 22 degrees (∠A＝22°), and angle CGF is 88 degrees (∠CGF＝88°).

## Deduction Steps:

1. **Congruent Triangles:** Since △ABC≌△DEF, we know that corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, ∠A = ∠D = 22°.

2. **Angle Bisector:** CD bisects ∠BCA, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts. So, ∠BCD = ∠ACD.

3. **Angle Sum Property:** The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180°.  Therefore, in triangle ABC: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.

4. **Finding ∠C:** We know ∠A = 22°.  We also know that ∠C = ∠BCD + ∠ACD. Since CD bisects ∠BCA, ∠BCD = ∠ACD.  Therefore, ∠C = 2 * ∠BCD.

5. **Finding ∠BCD:**  We know ∠CGF = 88°.  Since ∠CGF and ∠BCD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°), we can find ∠BCD: ∠BCD = 180° - ∠CGF = 180° - 88° = 92°.

6. **Finding ∠C:** Now we can find ∠C: ∠C = 2 * ∠BCD = 2 * 92° = 184°.

7. **Finding ∠B:** Using the angle sum property in triangle ABC: ∠B = 180° - ∠A - ∠C = 180° - 22° - 184° = -26°.  This is impossible, as angles in a triangle cannot be negative. This indicates an error in the problem statement.

## Deduction Steps:

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**  We need to use some key geometric concepts to solve this. First, remember that the angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle. Since AB is the diameter, angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees).

2. **Angle Relationships:**  We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle BCD, we can find angle CBD: 
    *  ∠CBD = 180° - ∠BCD - ∠CDB = 180° - 25° - 90° = 65°

3. **Central Angle Theorem:**  The central angle theorem states that the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc. In our case, angle AOD is a central angle, and angle CBD is an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc (arc BD).

4. **Solving for the Central Angle:**  Using the central angle theorem, we can find the measure of angle AOD:
    * ∠AOD = 2 * ∠CBD = 2 * 65° = 130°

**1. Case File:**

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle ∠PAQ, given that ∠BAC = 110 degrees and points A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and points A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Symmetry and Angles:**  Remember, when two points are symmetrical with respect to a line, the line acts like a mirror. This means the angles formed on either side of the line are equal.

* **Applying Symmetry:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP. Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, we know that ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.

* **Angle Relationships:**  We can use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, ∠AMP + ∠BMP = 180 degrees and ∠ANQ + ∠CNQ = 180 degrees.

* **Solving for Missing Angles:** Since ∠AMP = ∠BMP and ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ, we can conclude that each of these pairs of angles measures 90 degrees (180 degrees / 2 = 90 degrees).

* **Finding ∠PAQ:** Now, let's focus on triangle PAQ. We know that ∠APQ = 90 degrees (from symmetry) and ∠AQP = 90 degrees (from symmetry).  The angles inside a triangle always add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, ∠PAQ = 180 degrees - ∠APQ - ∠AQP = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees = 0 degrees.

   The key to solving this is the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**. This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Step 2:  Identifying the Intercepted Arcs**

   * The inscribed angle with measure 83 degrees intercepts arc $\overline{CH}$.
   * The inscribed angle with measure (2x - 27) degrees intercepts arc $\overline{KJ}$.

* **Step 3:  Applying the Theorem**

   Since $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$, their intercepted arcs are also congruent.  Therefore, the measures of the inscribed angles intercepting these arcs are equal.

* **Step 4:  Setting up the Equation**

   We can set up an equation: 
   83 degrees = (2x - 27) degrees

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**  The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between angles formed by intersecting chords and angles formed by a tangent and a chord.  The theorem we need is: **The measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to one-half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.**

* **Step 2: Apply the theorem.**  Let's focus on the angle inside the circle, (4x + 50) degrees.  This angle intercepts two arcs.  One arc is the smaller arc between the two chords, and the other arc is the larger arc that goes all the way around the circle.  We don't know the measures of these arcs, but we can use the fact that the sum of the measures of the arcs in a circle is 360 degrees.

* **Step 3: Set up an equation.**  Let's call the measure of the smaller arc ""a"" and the measure of the larger arc ""b"".  We know that a + b = 360 degrees.  We also know that (4x + 50) degrees is half the sum of a and b.  So, we can write the equation:

    (4x + 50) = (1/2)(a + b)

* **Step 4: Substitute and solve.**  We know that a + b = 360 degrees.  Substituting this into our equation, we get:

    (4x + 50) = (1/2)(360)

    Simplifying, we get:

    4x + 50 = 180

    Subtracting 50 from both sides, we get:

**Deduction Steps:**

1. **Understanding Center of Mass:** The center of mass is the point where the entire mass of an object can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object like our triangle, it's the point where the object would balance perfectly.

2. **Symmetry and Intuition:** Since the triangle is symmetrical, we know the center of mass will lie on the line of symmetry, which is the vertical line passing through the right angle. This means the x-coordinate of the center of mass is already known (it's at the midpoint of the base).

3. **Dividing the Triangle:** Imagine dividing the triangle into thin horizontal strips. Each strip has a small mass, and the center of mass of each strip lies at its midpoint.

4. **Finding the Average:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the entire triangle is the average of the y-coordinates of the centers of mass of all these strips.

5. **The Formula:**  We can use the following formula to find the y-coordinate of the center of mass:

   y_cm = (1/A) * ∫(y * dA)

   Where:
   * y_cm is the y-coordinate of the center of mass
   * A is the total area of the triangle
   * y is the y-coordinate of a small strip
   * dA is the area of a small strip

6. **Applying the Formula:**
   * The area of the triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * a * a = a^2/2
   * The y-coordinate of a small strip at a distance y from the base is simply y.
   * The area of a small strip is approximately dA = (base of strip) * dy = (2 * (a - y)) * dy (since the base of the strip is twice the distance from the y-axis to the edge of the triangle)

7. **Integration:** Now we need to integrate the expression (y * dA) from y = 0 to y = a:

   ∫(y * dA) = ∫(y * 2 * (a - y) * dy) = ∫(2ay - 2y^2) dy = [ay^2 - (2/3)y^3] from 0 to a

8. **Evaluating the Integral:**
   * Plugging in the limits of integration, we get: [a^3 - (2/3)a^3] - [0 - 0] = (1/3)a^3

9. **Final Calculation:**
   * Finally, we divide the result by the total area of the triangle:
   * y_cm = (1/A) * ∫(y * dA) = (2/a^2) * (1/3)a^3 = (2/3)a

**The Big Reveal:**

We've got a circuit with an infinite number of resistors, each with a resistance of R. Our goal is to find the total resistance between points 'a' and 'b'.

**Deduction Steps:**

2. **The Key Insight:**  The resistance between 'a' and 'b' is the same as the resistance between 'a' and 'c'.  This is because the circuit to the right of 'c' is identical to the whole circuit, so it has the same resistance.

3. **Breaking it Down:** Let's analyze the circuit between 'a' and 'c'. We have three resistors in series (R + R + R = 3R) and one resistor in parallel with this series combination (R).

4. **Parallel Resistance:** To find the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel, we use the formula:

   1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ...

   In our case, we have:

   1/R_ac = 1/3R + 1/R

   Simplifying, we get:

   1/R_ac = 4/3R

**Final Answer:**  Since R = 1, the total resistance between 'a' and 'b' is 3/4.

Partner, we have a case! The image shows a circle with four points marked on its circumference: L, M, N, and R.  These points divide the circle into four sectors.  We know that angle MCN is 60 degrees, angle RCL is (3x + 5) degrees, and angle RCM is (x - 1) degrees.  The case is to find the measure of angle NCL, which we can represent as  m∠NCL.

## Deduction Steps:

1. **The Circle's Secrets:**  Remember, a circle has 360 degrees.  This means all the angles around the center point C add up to 360 degrees.  We can write this as an equation:

   m∠RCM + m∠MCN + m∠NCL + m∠LCR = 360°

2. **Plugging in the Clues:** We know the values of three of these angles:

   * m∠RCM = (x - 1)°
   * m∠MCN = 60°
   * m∠LCR = (3x + 5)°

   Let's substitute these values into our equation:

   (x - 1)° + 60° + m∠NCL + (3x + 5)° = 360°

3. **Solving for the Unknown:** Now we have an equation with only one unknown, m∠NCL. Let's simplify the equation:

   4x + 64° + m∠NCL = 360°

   Subtract 64° from both sides:

   4x + m∠NCL = 296°

   Subtract 4x from both sides:

   m∠NCL = 296° - 4x

4. **Finding the Value of x:**  We need to find the value of x to solve for m∠NCL.  Notice that angles RCM and RCL together form angle RCL.  This means:

   m∠RCM + m∠RCL = m∠RCL

   Substitute the values we know:

   (x - 1)° + (3x + 5)° = m∠RCL

   Simplify:

   4x + 4° = m∠RCL

   Since angle RCL is part of the circle, it must also be less than 360 degrees.  We can use this information to find the value of x.  Let's assume m∠RCL is less than 180 degrees.  This gives us:

   4x + 4° < 180°

   Subtract 4° from both sides:

   4x < 176°

   Divide both sides by 4:

   x < 44°

   Since x must be less than 44 degrees, we can try different values of x to see if they satisfy the conditions of the problem.  Let's try x = 40°.

   m∠RCM = (40 - 1)° = 39°
   m∠RCL = (3 * 40 + 5)° = 125°

   These values seem reasonable, so we can assume x = 40°.

5. **The Final Solution:** Now that we know x = 40°, we can find m∠NCL:

   m∠NCL = 296° - 4x = 296° - 4 * 40° = 296° - 160° = 136°

## The Big Reveal:

The measure of angle NCL, m∠NCL, is **136 degrees**.  We arrived at this answer by using the fact that the angles around a circle add up to 360 degrees, substituting the known values into an equation, solving for the unknown angle, and finding the value of x using the relationship between angles RCM and RCL.

    * The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is 720 degrees.

* **Step 2: Finding Each Interior Angle**
    * Since all angles are equal in a regular hexagon, each interior angle is 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.

* **Step 3: Focusing on Triangle ABO**
    * Triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle because OA and OB are radii of the hexagon.
    * Therefore, angles OAB and OBA are equal.

* **Step 4: Applying the Angle Sum Property**
    * The sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.
    * In triangle ABO, we have: angle OAB + angle OBA + angle AOB = 180 degrees.
    * Since angle OAB = angle OBA, we can write: 2 * angle OAB + angle AOB = 180 degrees.

* **Step 5: Finding Angle AOB**
    * Angle AOB is one-sixth of the total angle around point O (360 degrees).
    * Therefore, angle AOB = 360 degrees / 6 = 60 degrees.

* **Step 6: Solving for Angle OAB**
    * Substituting the value of angle AOB in the equation from Step 4: 2 * angle OAB + 60 degrees = 180 degrees.
    * Solving for angle OAB: 2 * angle OAB = 120 degrees, so angle OAB = 60 degrees.

* **Step 7: Finding Angle x**
    * Angle x is the same as angle OAB because they are alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines AB and CD.

Therefore, the value of x is **60 degrees**.

**2. Deduction Steps:**

* **The Key:**  The crucial piece of information here is that the inscribed angle ∠DCE is half the measure of the intercepted arc.  
* **The Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem:  ∠DCE = 1/2 * arc DE

   The given proportion IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ tells us that triangles IYJ and XHJ are similar.  Remember, similar triangles have the same shape but different sizes. Their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proportional.

* **Step 2: Finding Missing Angles**

   *  Since ∠WXJ and ∠GXJ are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°), we can find m∠GXJ:
      m∠GXJ = 180° - m∠WXJ = 180° - 130° = 50°

      m∠YZG = 180° - m∠WZG = 180° - 20° = 160°

   *  Because triangles IYJ and XHJ are similar, we know that:
      m∠YIJ = m∠XHJ (Corresponding angles are equal)

   *  We also know that m∠GXJ = 50°. Since ∠GXJ and ∠XHJ are adjacent angles, we can find m∠XHJ:

* **Detective AI:**  Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know that angle CGB is a right angle (90 degrees).  This is crucial because it allows us to use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.

**Step 3: Finding Angle BCG**

* **Rookie:**  Let's find angle BCG.
* **Detective AI:**  We know that angle ACG is 32 degrees and angle CGB is 90 degrees.  Since angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle BCG:

**Step 4: Finding Angle BCF**

* **Rookie:**  How do we find angle BCF?
* **Detective AI:**  We know that CD bisects angle ACB.  Therefore, angle BCF is half of angle ACB.  We can find angle ACB by using the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees:
    * Angle ACB = 180 degrees - angle BAC - angle ABC.
    * We don't know the values of angle BAC and angle ABC, but we can use the fact that BE and CD are angle bisectors.  This means:

    * Substituting these values into the equation for angle ACB:
        * Angle ACB = 180 degrees - 2 * angle ABE - 2 * angle CBE
    * Since angle ABE + angle CBE = angle ABC, we can simplify:
        * Angle ACB = 180 degrees - 2 * angle ABC
    * Now, we can find angle BCF:
        * Angle BCF = (1/2) * angle ACB = (1/2) * (180 degrees - 2 * angle ABC) = 90 degrees - angle ABC.

**Step 5: Finding Angle BFC**

* **Rookie:**  Finally, how do we find angle BFC?
* **Detective AI:**  We can use the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees:
    * Angle BFC = 180 degrees - angle BCF - angle CBF.
    * We know angle BCF = 90 degrees - angle ABC and angle CBF = angle CBE.  Substituting these values:
        * Angle BFC = 180 degrees - (90 degrees - angle ABC) - angle CBE = 90 degrees + angle ABC - angle CBE.
    * Since BE is an angle bisector, angle ABC = 2 * angle CBE.  Substituting this:
