132,如图，在4×4的正方形网格中，每个小正方形的边长均为1，点A，B，C都在格点上，AD⊥BC于D，则AD的长为（）,2,"The length of AD is 2.

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Count the units:**  Notice that AB has a length of 4 units (4 squares vertically) and BC has a length of 3 units (3 squares horizontally).

2. **Recognize the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Triangle ABC is a right triangle.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of AC:

   * a² + b² = c²
   * 4² + 3² = c²
   * 16 + 9 = c²
   * 25 = c²
   * c = 5

3. **Find the area of triangle ABC:**  The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  We can use either AB or BC as the base, and the corresponding height will be AD or CD.

   * Area of ABC = (1/2) * AB * AD = (1/2) * 4 * AD = 2AD
   * Area of ABC = (1/2) * BC * CD = (1/2) * 3 * CD = (3/2) * CD

4. **Equate the areas:** Since both expressions represent the area of the same triangle, they must be equal:

   * 2AD = (3/2) * CD

5. **Use similar triangles:**  Triangles ABC and ADC are similar (they have the same angles).  This means their corresponding sides are proportional:

   * AD/AB = CD/BC
   * AD/4 = CD/3

6. **Solve for AD:**  We now have two equations with two unknowns (AD and CD).  We can solve for AD:

   * From the area equation: CD = (4/3) * AD
   * Substitute this into the similar triangles equation: AD/4 = [(4/3) * AD]/3
   * Simplify: 3AD = 16AD
   * Solve for AD: 13AD = 0
   * Therefore, AD = 0.

However, this answer doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.  We made an error in our calculations.  Let's go back and check our work.

The error is in the step where we equate the areas.  We should have used the correct height for each base:

* Area of ABC = (1/2) * AB * AD = (1/2) * 4 * AD = 2AD
* Area of ABC = (1/2) * BC * AC = (1/2) * 3 * 5 = 7.5

Now, equating the areas:

* 2AD = 7.5
* AD = 7.5 / 2
* AD = 3.75

This answer is still incorrect.  The problem lies in our assumption that AC is the height for BC.  AC is the hypotenuse of the triangle, not the height.

Let's try again, using the correct height for each base:

* Area of ABC = (1/2) * AB * AD = (1/2) * 4 * AD = 2AD
* Area of ABC = (1/2) * BC * CD = (1/2) * 3 * CD = (3/2) * CD

Now, equating the areas:

* 2AD = (3/2) * CD

We also know from the similar triangles:

* AD/4 = CD/3

Solving for CD in the second equation:

* CD = (3/4) * AD

Substituting this into the first equation:

* 2AD = (3/2) * [(3/4) * AD]
* 2AD = (9/8) * AD
* (7/8) * AD = 0
* AD = 0

Again, we get an incorrect answer.  The problem is that we are trying to solve for AD using the area of the triangle, but we don't know the area of the triangle.  We need to find the area of the triangle first.

Let's try a different approach.  We know that the area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  We can use either AB or BC as the base, and the corresponding height will be AD or CD.  We also know that the area of a triangle is equal to half the product of its base and height.  Therefore, we can write:

* Area of ABC = (1/2) * AB * AD = (1/2)",False,0,8.68739104270935,1316.0
549,"As shown in the figure, PA and PB are tangent to ⊙O to A and B respectively. Point C and point D are the moving points on line segments PA and PB, and CD always remains tangent to circle O. If PA = 8.0, then perimeter of △PCD is ()",16,"The perimeter of △PCD is PC + CD + PD.

Since PA and PB are tangent to ⊙O, we know that OA = OB and ∠OAP = ∠OBP = 90°.

Therefore, △OAP and △OBP are congruent right triangles.

So, AP = BP = 8.0.

Since CD is tangent to ⊙O, we know that OC = OD and ∠OCD = ∠ODC = 90°.

Therefore, △OCD is an isosceles right triangle.

So, CD = OC√2.

Since PC = PA - AC and PD = PB - BD, we know that PC + PD = PA + PB - (AC + BD).

Since AC = OC and BD = OD, we know that AC + BD = OC + OD = 2OC.

Therefore, PC + PD = PA + PB - 2OC = 8.0 + 8.0 - 2OC = 16 - 2OC.

So, the perimeter of △PCD is PC + CD + PD = 16 - 2OC + OC√2 + 16 - 2OC = 32 - 4OC + OC√2.

Since OC is a constant, the perimeter of △PCD is also a constant.

Since CD bisects ∠ACB, we have ∠ACD = ∠BCD.  We know ∠DBC = 54°, and since ∠BCD and ∠DBC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°), we have:

∠BCD = 180° - ∠DBC = 180° - 54° = 126°

Therefore, ∠ACD = ∠BCD = 126°.

**2. Find ∠BDC:**

We know BD⊥CD, which means ∠BDC is a right angle:

∠BDC = 90°

**3. Find ∠ABD:**

In triangle BDC, we can use the angle sum property (angles in a triangle add up to 180°):

∠DBC + ∠BDC + ∠CDB = 180°
54° + 90° + ∠CDB = 180°
∠CDB = 36°

Since ∠ABD = ∠CDB (given), we have:

∠ABD = 36°

**4. Find ∠A:**

In triangle ABD, we can use the angle sum property:

∠A + ∠ABD + ∠ADB = 180°
∠A + 36° + 90° = 180°
∠A = 54°

**Therefore, the measure of ∠A is 54°.**",False,0,3.556826114654541,650.0

Since AD is the median of triangle ABC, we know that BD = DC.  Also, since E is the midpoint of AD, we know that AE = ED.

Therefore, triangles ABE and ADE share the same base AE and the same height (the perpendicular distance from D to AE).  This means that the area of triangle ABE is equal to the area of triangle ADE.

Similarly, triangles ADE and CDE share the same base DE and the same height (the perpendicular distance from A to DE).  This means that the area of triangle ADE is equal to the area of triangle CDE.

Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles ABE, ADE, and CDE, which is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that a bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.  In this case, we have:

$$\frac{JQ}{QN} = \frac{JL}{LN}$$

We know that $JL = 16.5$ and $LN = 9 + 16.5 = 25.5$.  We also know that $QN = QK$ because $\overline{KQ}$ bisects $\angle K$.  Let $x = JQ = QN$.  Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:

$$\frac{x}{x} = \frac{16.5}{25.5}$$

Simplifying, we get:

The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that a bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.  In our case, this means:

Since BM ⊥ AM, we have two right triangles: AMB and AMC.  We know AM = 2√15 and MN = 2.  Therefore, in right triangle AMN, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find AN:

AN² = AM² - MN² = (2√15)² - 2² = 56

Therefore, AN = √56 = 2√14.

**Understanding the Problem**

We are given a right triangle ABC with a right angle at A. Three equilateral triangles are constructed outwards on the sides of this triangle:

*  △A'BC on side BC
*  △AB'C on side AC
*  △ABC' on side AB

We know the areas of △A'BC and △AB'C are 10 and 4, respectively. We need to find the area of △ABC'.

**Key Concepts**

* **Area of an equilateral triangle:** The area of an equilateral triangle with side 's' is given by (√3/4) * s².
* **Pythagorean Theorem:** In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

**Solution**

1. **Find the sides of the equilateral triangles:**
   * Let the side of △A'BC be 'a'.  Its area is 10, so (√3/4) * a² = 10. Solving for 'a', we get a = √(40/√3).
   * Let the side of △AB'C be 'b'. Its area is 4, so (√3/4) * b² = 4. Solving for 'b', we get b = √(16/√3).

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   * In right triangle ABC, AC = b and BC = a. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we have AB² = AC² + BC².
   * Substituting the values of 'a' and 'b', we get AB² = (16/√3) + (40/√3) = 56/√3.

3. **Find the area of △ABC':**
   * The side of △ABC' is AB. Its area is (√3/4) * AB² = (√3/4) * (56/√3) = 14.

* Since AB is a diameter, angle AOB is a straight angle, measuring 180 degrees.
* We know angle AOF is 40 degrees.
* Therefore, angle EOB = angle AOB - angle AOF = 180 degrees - 40 degrees = 140 degrees.

**2. Find the measure of angle EBF:**

* Angle EBF is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc EF.
* The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* Since E is the midpoint of FEB, arc EF is half of arc FEB.
* Therefore, angle EBF = (1/2) * (1/2) * angle EOB = (1/4) * 140 degrees = 35 degrees.

**3. Find the measure of angle F:**

* Triangle EBF is an isosceles triangle because EB = EF (both are radii of the circle).
* Therefore, angle EFB = angle EBF = 35 degrees.
* Finally, angle F = 180 degrees - angle EFB - angle EBF = 180 degrees - 35 degrees - 35 degrees = **110 degrees**.

We are given a triangle ABC with an angle bisector AD. DE is perpendicular to AB, and we know DE = 3 and AC = 4. We need to find the area of triangle ADC.

**2. Use the angle bisector theorem:**

The angle bisector theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides. In our case, this means:

BD/DC = AB/AC

**3. Find AB:**

Since DE is perpendicular to AB, we have a right triangle ADE. We know DE = 3 and AD is the hypotenuse. Using the Pythagorean theorem:

AD² = DE² + AE²

We need to find AE. Since AD is the angle bisector, we know that angle BAD = angle CAD. Therefore, triangles ADE and ADC are similar. This means:

AE/AC = DE/DC

We can rewrite this as:

AE = (DE/DC) * AC

We don't know DC yet, but we can use the angle bisector theorem to find it. Let's assume BD = x, then DC = BC - x.

Substituting into the angle bisector theorem:

x/(BC - x) = AB/AC

We know AC = 4, but we don't know AB or BC. We need more information to solve for x and AB.

**4. Find the area of triangle ADC:**

The area of a triangle is given by:

Area = (1/2) * base * height

In triangle ADC, the base is AC = 4 and the height is DE = 3. Therefore:

Area of triangle ADC = (1/2) * 4 * 3 = 6

**Conclusion:**

We cannot find the exact values of BD, DC, and AB without more information. However, we can find the area of triangle ADC, which is **6 square units**.

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a quadrilateral ABCD with specific angle measures. We need to find points M and N on sides BC and CD, respectively, such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized.  Then, we need to find the sum of angles AMN and ANM.

**Solution**

1. **Symmetry:**  Notice that the problem has symmetry.  Since ∠BAD = 120° and ∠B = ∠D = 90°, we can reflect the figure across line AD. This reflection will map point B to point C, and point M to a point on CD.  This means that the optimal position for point N is the reflection of point M across line AD.

2. **Minimizing Perimeter:** To minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, we need to minimize the lengths of AM and AN.  Since AM and AN are reflections of each other, we only need to focus on minimizing AM.

3. **Shortest Distance:** The shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. Therefore, to minimize AM, we need to make AM perpendicular to BC.  Similarly, to minimize AN, we need to make AN perpendicular to CD.

4. **Angle Calculation:** Since AM is perpendicular to BC and AN is perpendicular to CD, we have:
   - ∠AMB = ∠AND = 90°

5. **Sum of Angles:** In triangle AMN, we have:
   - ∠AMN + ∠ANM + ∠MAN = 180°
   - ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 180° - ∠MAN

6. **Finding ∠MAN:** Since ∠BAD = 120° and AM and AN are perpendicular to BC and CD respectively, we have:
   - ∠MAN = 180° - ∠BAD = 180° - 120° = 60°

7. **Final Calculation:** Substituting the value of ∠MAN into the equation from step 5:
   - ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 180° - 60° = 120°

280,"In the figure above, ABCDEF is a regular hexagon, and its center is point O. What is the value of x?",60,"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Angles in a Hexagon:** A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is 720 degrees.  Therefore, each angle in a regular hexagon measures 720/6 = 120 degrees.

* **Central Angles:**  Point O is the center of the hexagon, so lines drawn from O to each vertex divide the hexagon into six congruent triangles.  Each of these triangles has a central angle at point O.  Since there are 360 degrees in a circle, each central angle measures 360/6 = 60 degrees.

* **Finding x:**  Angle BOC is one of the central angles, so it measures 60 degrees.  Angle ABO is half of angle ABC (since AB is a side of the hexagon), so it measures 120/2 = 60 degrees.  Therefore, angle x is the remaining angle in triangle ABO, and we can find it using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees:

   x = 180 - 60 - 60 = 60

737,Find the perimeter of the parallelogram.,78,"The perimeter of a parallelogram is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.  Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, we can find the perimeter by adding the lengths of two adjacent sides and multiplying by 2.

The length of one side is 23 ft.  To find the length of the other side, we can use trigonometry.  The angle between the 23 ft side and the dashed line is 60 degrees.  The dashed line is the opposite side of the angle, and the 23 ft side is the adjacent side.  Therefore, we can use the tangent function:

tan(60°) = opposite/adjacent = dashed line/23 ft
