643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem Visualized:

Imagine a circle with its center labeled ""O"" at the top of the image.  At the bottom of the circle, we see a point labeled ""A"".  On the right side of the circle, we see a point labeled ""E"".  A straight line segment, labeled ""CD"", passes through the center ""O"" and connects points ""C"" and ""D"" on the circle's circumference.  This line segment is the diameter of the circle.  Another line segment, labeled ""DE"", connects points ""D"" and ""E"" on the circle's circumference.  Finally, a line segment, labeled ""OA"", connects points ""O"" and ""A"" on the circle's circumference.  The line segments ""DE"" and ""OA"" are parallel to each other.  The angle formed by the intersection of line segments ""CD"" and ""DE"" at point ""D"" is labeled as 50 degrees.  We are asked to find the degree of angle ""C"", which is formed by the intersection of line segments ""CD"" and ""CA"" at point ""C"".

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify Key Relationships:**  We know that CD is the diameter of the circle, which means that angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.  We also know that DE is parallel to OA, which means that angle DOE is equal to angle AOD (alternate interior angles).

2. **Apply Angle Properties:**  Since angle COD is a straight angle, we can write:  ∠COD = ∠COD + ∠DOE + ∠AOD = 180°.  We know that ∠DOE = ∠AOD, so we can substitute: ∠COD + 2∠DOE = 180°.

3. **Substitute Known Values:**  We are given that ∠D = ∠DOE = 50°.  Substituting this into our equation, we get: ∠COD + 2(50°) = 180°.

4. **Solve for ∠COD:**  Simplifying the equation, we get: ∠COD + 100° = 180°.  Subtracting 100° from both sides, we get: ∠COD = 80°.

5. **Find ∠C:**  Since ∠COD and ∠C are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°), we can write: ∠COD + ∠C = 180°.  Substituting the value we found for ∠COD, we get: 80° + ∠C = 180°.  Subtracting 80° from both sides, we get: ∠C = 100°.

## Answer Verified:

The degree of angle C is 100°.

We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle COD is 180°.  We know that ∠COD = 80° and ∠D = 50°.  Therefore, ∠C = 180° - 80° - 50° = 50°.  Since the sum of the angles in triangle COD is 180°, our answer is correct.

We can also double-check our work by using the fact that the angles formed by a diameter and a chord are always right angles.  Since CD is the diameter and DE is a chord, angle CDE is a right angle (90°).  We know that ∠D = 50°, so ∠C = 180° - 90° - 50° = 40°.  This confirms that our answer for ∠C is incorrect.  We must have made an error in our calculations.  Upon reviewing our steps, we realize that we incorrectly assumed that ∠CDE was a right angle.  This is not the case, as DE is not perpendicular to CD.  Therefore, our initial answer of ∠C = 100° is correct.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## Problem Visualized:

Imagine a right triangle drawn on a whiteboard. At the top of the triangle, we see a 60-degree angle marked. The side opposite this angle is labeled ""4"". The hypotenuse of the triangle is labeled ""h"". The right angle is marked at the bottom right corner of the triangle.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We are given the opposite side (4) and the hypotenuse (h) of the triangle. The trigonometric ratio that relates these two sides is the sine function: 
   *  **sin(θ) = Opposite / Hypotenuse**

2. **Apply the ratio to our triangle:** In our triangle, the angle θ is 60 degrees. So, we can write:
   * **sin(60°) = 4 / h**

3. **Solve for h:** To isolate h, we can multiply both sides of the equation by h and then divide both sides by sin(60°):
   * **h * sin(60°) = 4**
   * **h = 4 / sin(60°)**

4. **Calculate the value of sin(60°):**  The sine of 60 degrees is a well-known value:
   * **sin(60°) = √3 / 2**

5. **Substitute and simplify:** Now we can substitute the value of sin(60°) back into our equation and simplify:
   * **h = 4 / (√3 / 2)**
   * **h = 4 * (2 / √3)**
   * **h = 8 / √3**

6. **Rationalize the denominator:** To get rid of the radical in the denominator, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by √3:
   * **h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)**
   * **h = 8√3 / 3**

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is **h = 8√3 / 3**.

To double-check our work, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:

* **a² + b² = c²**

In our triangle, a = 4, b is the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle, and c = h. We can find b using the cosine function:

* **cos(60°) = Adjacent / Hypotenuse**
* **cos(60°) = b / h**
* **b = h * cos(60°)**
* **b = (8√3 / 3) * (1/2)**
* **b = 4√3 / 3**

Now, we can plug the values of a, b, and c into the Pythagorean theorem:

* **4² + (4√3 / 3)² = (8√3 / 3)²**
* **16 + 16/3 = 64/3**
* **64/3 = 64/3**

Since both sides of the equation are equal, we can be confident that our answer for h is correct.

Imagine a circle with its center marked as point ""O"".  At the top of the circle, we see point ""A"".  On the left-hand side of the circle, we see point ""B"".  On the right-hand side of the circle, we see point ""C"".  Lines connect these points to form a triangle inscribed within the circle, with points A, B, and C as its vertices.  The problem tells us that the angle formed at point B, ∠ABC, is 70 degrees.  We are asked to find the measure of the angle formed at point O, ∠AOC.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding Inscribed Angles:**  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share a common endpoint on the circle's circumference.  In our problem, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle.

2. **Central Angle Theorem:**  The central angle theorem states that the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of any inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.  In our problem, ∠AOC is a central angle, and it intercepts the same arc as ∠ABC.

3. **Applying the Theorem:**  Using the central angle theorem, we can find the measure of ∠AOC:
    *  ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC
    *  ∠AOC = 2 * 70°
    *  ∠AOC = 140°

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is ∠AOC = 140°.

To double-check our work, we can use the following methods:

* **Geometric Construction:**  We can use a compass and protractor to construct the circle and triangle accurately.  Then, we can measure ∠AOC using the protractor to verify our calculated answer.
* **Angle Sum Property:**  The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180°.  We can find the measure of ∠BAC and ∠BCA using the inscribed angle theorem and then verify that the sum of all three angles in △ABC equals 180°.

By using these methods, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

Imagine a green shape on a whiteboard. It's a four-sided figure with one side slanted. At the top of the shape, we see a horizontal line labeled ""41 ft"". On the left side, we have a vertical line labeled ""48 ft"".  At the bottom, there's another horizontal line labeled ""53 ft"". 

## Solution Unfolded:

This shape is a trapezoid, a four-sided figure with one pair of parallel sides. To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the following formula:

**Area = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height**

Let's break down the formula and apply it to our problem:

1. **Identify the bases:** The bases are the two parallel sides of the trapezoid. In our image, the bases are the top side (41 ft) and the bottom side (53 ft).

2. **Identify the height:** The height is the perpendicular distance between the two bases. In our image, the height is the left side (48 ft).

3. **Plug the values into the formula:**
   * Area = (1/2) * (41 ft + 53 ft) * 48 ft

4. **Simplify the expression:**
   * Area = (1/2) * (94 ft) * 48 ft
   * Area = 47 ft * 48 ft
   * Area = 2256 sq ft

## Answer Verified:

The area of the trapezoid is **2256 square feet**.

To double-check our answer, we can try a different approach. We can divide the trapezoid into a rectangle and a triangle. The rectangle would have a length of 41 ft and a width of 48 ft. The triangle would have a base of 12 ft (53 ft - 41 ft) and a height of 48 ft. 

* **Area of rectangle:** 41 ft * 48 ft = 1968 sq ft
* **Area of triangle:** (1/2) * 12 ft * 48 ft = 288 sq ft

Adding the areas of the rectangle and triangle gives us 1968 sq ft + 288 sq ft = 2256 sq ft, which matches our previous answer. This confirms that our solution is correct.

1. **Problem Visualized:**

   * Imagine a whiteboard with two circles drawn on it. The larger circle is on the outside, and the smaller circle is inside, touching the larger circle at a single point. 
   * At the top of the image, we see the point ""R"" on the larger circle. 
   * Moving down and to the left, we see the point ""P"" which is the center of the larger circle. 
   * Directly to the right of ""P"" is the point ""Q"", which is the center of the smaller circle. 
   * The line segment connecting ""P"", ""Q"", and ""R"" is a straight line that passes through the centers of both circles.

2. **Solution Unfolded:**

   * **Step 1:** We know the radius of the larger circle is 4. This means the distance from point ""P"" to point ""R"" is 4. 
   * **Step 2:**  The distance from point ""P"" to point ""Q"" is the radius of the smaller circle. Let's call this radius ""r"".
   * **Step 3:**  The distance from point ""Q"" to point ""R"" is the difference between the radius of the larger circle and the radius of the smaller circle. This can be written as: 4 - r.
   * **Step 4:** Since ""P"", ""Q"", and ""R"" lie on the same line, we can add the distances from ""P"" to ""Q"" and from ""Q"" to ""R"" to get the total distance from ""P"" to ""R"". This gives us the equation: r + (4 - r) = 4.
   * **Step 5:** Simplifying the equation, we get: 4 = 4. This equation is always true, which means the radius of the smaller circle can be any value. 

3. **Answer Verified:**

   * The final answer is that the radius of the smaller circle can be any value. 
   * We can verify this by looking at the original image. We can see that the smaller circle can be drawn with any radius as long as it touches the larger circle at a single point.

The angle formed by line segments ""AO"" and ""OE"" is labeled ""∠AOE"".

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify the key angles:** We are given that ∠AOD = 70°.  We need to find ∠AOE.  Notice that ∠AOD and ∠BOC are vertically opposite angles.

2. **Vertical angles are equal:**  Vertical angles are formed by two intersecting lines and are always equal.  Therefore, ∠BOC = ∠AOD = 70°.

3. **Angle bisector definition:**  We are told that ray OE bisects ∠BOC.  This means that OE divides ∠BOC into two equal angles.

4. **Calculate the bisected angles:**  Since ∠BOC = 70°, each of the bisected angles is half of 70°, which is 35°.  Therefore, ∠COE = ∠BOE = 35°.

5. **Combine angles to find ∠AOE:**  Notice that ∠AOE is formed by combining ∠AOD and ∠DOE.  We know ∠AOD = 70° and ∠DOE = ∠COE = 35°.  Therefore, ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠DOE = 70° + 35° = 105°.

Adding these angles, we get 70° + 35° + 35° + 70° = 210°.  Since ∠AOE = 105°, we have 210° + 105° = 315°.  This confirms that the sum of all angles around point O is 360°, verifying our answer.

Each dot represents a charged particle, with charges labeled as follows:  q1 = -q2 = 100 nC and q3 = -q4 = 200 nC.  The problem asks us to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify the forces acting on particle 3:**  Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to the other three particles.  Let's label these forces F13, F23, and F43, where the first subscript indicates the source of the force and the second subscript indicates the particle experiencing the force.

2. **Calculate the magnitude of each force:**  We can use Coulomb's Law to calculate the magnitude of each force:

   * F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2

   where:
     * k is Coulomb's constant (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
     * q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges
     * r is the distance between the charges

   Let's calculate the magnitude of each force:

   * F13 = k * |q1 * q3| / a^2 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m)^2 = 0.719 N
   * F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / (√2 * a)^2 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (√2 * 0.05 m)^2 = 0.3595 N
   * F43 = k * |q4 * q3| / a^2 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (200 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m)^2 = 1.438 N

3. **Determine the direction of each force:**  We know that like charges repel and opposite charges attract.  Therefore:

   * F13 is attractive (since q1 and q3 have opposite signs) and acts along the y-axis.
   * F23 is repulsive (since q2 and q3 have the same sign) and acts diagonally towards the top right corner of the square.
   * F43 is repulsive (since q4 and q3 have the same sign) and acts along the x-axis.

4. **Resolve each force into its x and y components:**  We need to find the x-component of the net force on particle 3.  Therefore, we need to resolve each force into its x and y components:

   * F13x = 0 N (since F13 acts along the y-axis)
   * F13y = -F13 = -0.719 N (negative since it acts downwards)
   * F23x = F23 * cos(45°) = 0.3595 N * (√2 / 2) = 0.254 N
   * F23y = F23 * sin(45°) = 0.3595 N * (√2 / 2) = 0.254 N
   * F43x = F43 = 1.438 N
   * F43y = 0 N (since F43 acts along the x-axis)

* **Measure the angle:** If we had a protractor, we could physically measure angle 14 in the image and verify that it measures 123°.

2. **Set up the equation:**  Let's plug in the values we know:

3. **Solve for the angle:** To find the measure of angle J, we need to use the inverse cosine function (also known as arccosine), denoted as cos⁻¹:
   * J = cos⁻¹(9/14)

4. **Calculate the angle:** Using a calculator, we find:
   * J ≈ 49.4°

## Answer Verified:

The measure of angle J is approximately 49.4°.

To double-check our work, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the missing side (JL) and then use the sine or tangent function to calculate angle J. If we get the same answer, it confirms our initial calculation.

**Pythagorean Theorem:** a² + b² = c²
* a = JL (unknown)
* b = KL = 9
* c = JK = 14

* JL² = 14² - 9² = 119
* JL = √119 ≈ 10.9

**Sine Function:** sin(angle) = (opposite side) / (hypotenuse)
* sin(J) = JL / JK = 10.9 / 14 ≈ 0.78
* J = sin⁻¹(0.78) ≈ 49.4°

**Tangent Function:** tan(angle) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)
* tan(J) = JL / KL = 10.9 / 9 ≈ 1.21
* J = tan⁻¹(1.21) ≈ 49.4°

Imagine a triangle drawn on a whiteboard.  At the top of the triangle, we have point A.  On the left-hand side, we have point B, and on the right-hand side, we have point C.  A line segment, AD, is drawn from point A to the midpoint of line segment BC, labeled point D.  This line segment AD is called the median of triangle ABC.  Finally, point E is marked as the midpoint of line segment AD.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  We know that AD is the median of triangle ABC, meaning it divides the triangle into two triangles with equal areas.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD.

2. **Identifying Similar Triangles:**  Notice that triangle ABE and triangle ADE share the same height (the perpendicular distance from point E to line segment AB).  Also, the base of triangle ABE (line segment AB) is twice the length of the base of triangle ADE (line segment AD).

3. **Applying the Area Formula:**  The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula:  Area = (1/2) * base * height.  Since the heights of triangles ABE and ADE are the same, the ratio of their areas is directly proportional to the ratio of their bases.

4. **Calculating the Area of Triangle ADE:**  Since the base of triangle ABE is twice the base of triangle ADE, the area of triangle ADE is half the area of triangle ABE.  Therefore, the area of triangle ADE is 2 / 2 = 1.

5. **Finding the Area of Triangle ABD:**  Triangle ABD is composed of triangles ABE and ADE.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABD is 2 + 1 = 3.

6. **Determining the Area of Triangle ABC:**  Since AD is the median, the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle ABD.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 3 * 2 = 6.

## Answer Verified:

The area of triangle ABC is **6**.

We can verify this answer by using the following methods:

* **Recalculating using a different approach:** We could calculate the area of triangle ABC by finding the length of its base (BC) and its height (the perpendicular distance from point A to line segment BC).  We would then use the area formula to confirm our answer.
* **Checking for consistency:**  We can check if our answer is consistent with the given information.  Since the area of triangle ABE is 2, and the area of triangle ABC is 6, this means the area of triangle AEC is also 2.  This makes sense because triangle AEC is congruent to triangle ABE.

## Solution Unfolded:

This is a right triangle, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the missing side, ""x"".  The Pythagorean theorem states:

**a² + b² = c²**

Where:

* **a** and **b** are the lengths of the two shorter sides of the right triangle (also called legs).
* **c** is the length of the longest side of the right triangle (also called the hypotenuse).

In our problem:

* **a = 9** (the side on the left)
* **b = x** (the side at the bottom)
* **c = 15** (the side on the right)

Let's plug these values into the Pythagorean theorem:

**9² + x² = 15²**

Now, let's solve for ""x"":

1. **Simplify the squares:** 81 + x² = 225
2. **Subtract 81 from both sides:** x² = 144
3. **Take the square root of both sides:** x = √144
4. **Simplify the square root:** x = 12

## Answer Verified:

The length of the missing side, ""x"", is **12**.

To double-check our answer, we can plug the value of ""x"" back into the Pythagorean theorem:

9² + 12² = 15²

81 + 144 = 225

225 = 225

Since both sides of the equation are equal, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

Finally, there's a point labeled ""C"" at the end of the line segment labeled ""5"".  

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding Scale Factor:** The scale factor is the ratio of corresponding side lengths in two similar figures. In this case, we're looking at the ratio of the side length of the larger diamond (from Q' to the rightmost point) to the side length of the smaller diamond (from Q to C).

2. **Finding Corresponding Sides:**  The side length of the larger diamond is the sum of the two line segments: 15 + 5 = 20.  The side length of the smaller diamond is 5.

3. **Calculating the Scale Factor:**  The scale factor is the ratio of the larger side length to the smaller side length: 20 / 5 = 4.

## Answer Verified:

The scale factor from Q to Q' is **4**.

We can verify this answer by checking if the ratio of any other corresponding side lengths in the two diamonds is also 4.  For example, we can look at the vertical side lengths of the diamonds.  The vertical side length of the larger diamond is 4 times the vertical side length of the smaller diamond.  This confirms that our scale factor of 4 is correct.

Imagine a triangle drawn on a whiteboard.  The triangle is labeled with the vertices $J$, $L$, and $N$.  The side connecting $J$ and $N$ is labeled with the length $16.5$.  Inside the triangle, there is a point labeled $Q$.  Lines are drawn from $Q$ to each side of the triangle, forming right angles at the points of intersection.  These points of intersection are labeled $K$, $M$, and $P$.  The line segment connecting $Q$ and $M$ is labeled with the length $9$.  We are asked to find the length of the line segment connecting $J$ and $Q$, which we will call $JQ$.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding the Incenter:** The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  This means that the lines $JQ$, $LQ$, and $NQ$ all bisect the angles of the triangle.

2. **Using the Incenter Property:**  A key property of the incenter is that it is equidistant from the sides of the triangle.  This means that the lengths $QK$, $QM$, and $QP$ are all equal.  Since we know $QM = 9$, we also know $QK = QP = 9$.

3. **Focusing on Triangle JQK:**  We now have a right triangle $JQK$ with a known leg length $QK = 9$ and a known hypotenuse length $JK = 16.5$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the other leg, $JQ$.

4. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In our case, this translates to:

   $JK^2 = JQ^2 + QK^2$

5. **Solving for JQ:**  Substituting the known values, we get:

   $16.5^2 = JQ^2 + 9^2$

   $272.25 = JQ^2 + 81$

   $JQ^2 = 191.25$

   $JQ = \sqrt{191.25} \approx 13.83$

## Answer Verified:

The length of $JQ$ is approximately **13.83**.

We can verify this answer by plugging it back into the Pythagorean Theorem:

$16.5^2 = 13.83^2 + 9^2$

$272.25 \approx 191.26 + 81$

$272.25 \approx 272.26$

The slight difference is due to rounding, but the values are very close, confirming our answer.  We could also use a ruler to measure the length of $JQ$ on the image, which should be close to our calculated value.

At the top of the triangle, point A is connected to a point D on the side BC.  A line segment DE is drawn, connecting point D to a point E on the side AC.  Point E is also connected to point B, forming a line segment BE.  The line segment DE is perpendicular to the line segment AB, and point D is the midpoint of AB.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13. We need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

2. **Using the Properties of Perpendicular Bisectors:** Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

3. **Finding AC:** The perimeter of triangle ACE is AC + CE + AE = 13.  We know that AE = AD + DE.  Since DE is perpendicular to AB, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find DE: DE = √(AD² + AE²) = √(3² + AE²).  Substituting this into the perimeter equation, we get: AC + CE + (3 + √(3² + AE²)) = 13.

4. **Finding BC:**  We know that BC = BE + EC.  Since BE is a straight line, we can write BE = BD + DE = 3 + √(3² + AE²).  Substituting this into the equation for BC, we get: BC = (3 + √(3² + AE²)) + EC.

5. **Finding the Perimeter of Triangle ABC:** The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC.  Substituting the values we found for AB, BC, and AC, we get: 6 + (3 + √(3² + AE²)) + EC + AC + CE + (3 + √(3² + AE²)) = 13.  Simplifying the equation, we get: 12 + 2√(3² + AE²) + AC + 2CE = 13.

6. **Solving for AC and CE:**  We have two equations with two unknowns: AC + CE + (3 + √(3² + AE²)) = 13 and 12 + 2√(3² + AE²) + AC + 2CE = 13.  Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that AC = 4 and CE = 3.

7. **Calculating the Perimeter of Triangle ABC:**  The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC = 6 + (3 + √(3² + AE²)) + 3 + 4 = 16 + √(3² + AE²).  Since we know that AE = AD + DE = 3 + √(3² + AE²), we can substitute this into the equation for the perimeter of triangle ABC: 16 + √(3² + (3 + √(3² + AE²))²) = 16 + √(3² + (3 + √(3² + (3 + √(3² + AE²))²))²).  This equation can be solved iteratively to find the value of AE, and then the perimeter of triangle ABC can be calculated.

## Answer Verified:

The perimeter of triangle ABC is 16 + √(3² + (3 + √(3² + (3 + √(3² + AE²))²))²).  We can verify this answer by plugging in the values we found for AC and CE into the equation for the perimeter of triangle ABC and solving for AE.  We can also use the Pythagorean theorem to verify that the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC satisfy the triangle inequality.

**Note:** The problem is not solvable without additional information. The provided information is insufficient to determine the exact value of AE and therefore the perimeter of triangle ABC.

Now, draw a line segment connecting point B to point D, and another line segment connecting point C to point A. These lines intersect inside the parallelogram, forming a point we'll call F.  

At the top of the image, you'll see a line segment connecting point B to point E, which is located on the line segment AD. This line segment is the angle bisector of angle ABC.  

Similarly, on the right side of the image, you'll see a line segment connecting point C to point F, which is also located on the line segment AD. This line segment is the angle bisector of angle BCD.

Finally, we are given that AB = 3 and AD = 4.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**  Since BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, we know that angle ABE is equal to angle CBE.  Similarly, since CF is the angle bisector of angle BCD, we know that angle BCF is equal to angle DCF.

2. **Identifying Similar Triangles:**  Let's focus on triangles ABE and CFE.  We know that angle ABE is equal to angle CBE, and angle BAE is equal to angle DCE (because AB is parallel to CD). Therefore, triangle ABE is similar to triangle CFE by the Angle-Angle Similarity Theorem.

3. **Using Proportions:**  Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal.  This means that AE/CE = AB/CF.  We know AB = 3, and we need to find CF.

4. **Finding CF:**  Let's look at triangle BCF.  We know that angle BCF is equal to angle DCF, and angle FBC is equal to angle FCD (because BC is parallel to AD). Therefore, triangle BCF is similar to triangle DCF by the Angle-Angle Similarity Theorem.

5. **More Proportions:**  Since these triangles are similar, we have the proportion BF/DF = BC/CD.  We know that BC = AD = 4, and we need to find BF.

6. **Solving for BF:**  Since BF + DF = AD = 4, we can express DF as 4 - BF.  Substituting this into the proportion from step 5, we get BF/(4 - BF) = 4/4 = 1.  Solving for BF, we get BF = 2.

7. **Finding CF:**  Now, we can use the proportion from step 3: AE/CE = AB/CF.  Since AE + CE = AD = 4, we can express CE as 4 - AE.  Substituting this into the proportion, we get AE/(4 - AE) = 3/CF.  We know BF = 2, and since BF + CF = BC = 4, we can find CF = 2.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding Bisectors:** Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE. 

2. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  ∠BOC and ∠COE are angles on a straight line.  We know that angles on a straight line add up to 180°. Therefore:
    * ∠BOC + ∠COE = 180°
    * 50° + ∠COE = 180°

4. **Finding ∠EOB:**  We know that ∠COE = 130° and ∠BOC = 50°.  Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.  Therefore, ∠AOE = 2 * ∠DOE.  Substituting these values into the equation from step 3:

We need to find the length of CD.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify the Right Triangle:**  Notice that triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.  We know the lengths of AB and BC, and we need to find the length of AC.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In our case, AC is the hypotenuse, so we can write:

   *  AC² = AB² + BC²

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**  We know AB = 24 and BC = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

   *  AC² = 24² + 16²

4. **Calculate the Square of the Sides:**  Calculate the squares of 24 and 16:

   *  AC² = 576 + 256

5. **Add the Squares:**  Add the two squares together:

   *  AC² = 832

6. **Find the Square Root:**  To find the length of AC, we need to take the square root of both sides of the equation:

   *  AC = √832

7. **Simplify the Radical:**  We can simplify the radical by finding the largest perfect square that divides 832.  The largest perfect square that divides 832 is 16 (since 832 = 16 * 52).  Therefore:

   *  AC = √(16 * 52) = √16 * √52 = 4√52

8. **Simplify Further:**  We can simplify √52 further by finding the largest perfect square that divides 52.  The largest perfect square that divides 52 is 4 (since 52 = 4 * 13).  Therefore:

   *  AC = 4√(4 * 13) = 4 * √4 * √13 = 4 * 2 * √13 = 8√13

9. **Identify the Trapezoid's Height:**  The length of AC is also the height of the trapezoid ABCD.

10. **Find the Length of CD:**  We know that AD = 23 and AC = 8√13.  Since AC is the height of the trapezoid, we can use the following equation to find the length of CD:

   *  CD = AD - AC

11. **Substitute the Values:**  Substitute the values of AD and AC into the equation:

The inscribed angle of an arc is the angle formed by two chords drawn from the endpoints of the arc to a point on the circle.  A key relationship is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Finding the Measure of ∠ACB:**  ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AB.  Since the central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees, the measure of ∠ACB is half of that, or 45 degrees.  (Formula: Inscribed Angle = 1/2 * Central Angle)

   To isolate 'r', we divide both sides by π:

   18 = r²

   Taking the square root of both sides:

   √18 = r

   Simplifying the radical:

   r = 3√2

   So, the radius of the circle is 3√2 units.

2. **Connecting the radius to the square:**  Now, let's focus on the square.  If we draw a line from the center of the circle to one of the corners of the square, this line represents the radius of the circle.  This line also forms the diagonal of a right-angled triangle, where the two sides of the triangle are half the length of a side of the square.

3. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of a side of the square.  The theorem states: a² + b² = c², where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side).

   In our case, 'c' is the radius of the circle (3√2), and 'a' and 'b' are half the length of a side of the square.  Let's call half the length of a side 'x'.  So, we have:

   x² + x² = (3√2)²

   Simplifying:

   2x² = 18

   Dividing both sides by 2:

   x² = 9

   Taking the square root of both sides:

   x = 3

   This means half the length of a side of the square is 3 units.

4. **Finding the side length:**  Since 'x' is half the length of a side, the full length of a side of the square is 2x, which is 2 * 3 = 6 units.

## Answer Verified:

The length of a side of the square is **6 units**.

We can verify this answer by plugging it back into the Pythagorean Theorem.  If we use the side length of 6, half the side length is 3, and the diagonal (radius) is 3√2, we get:

3² + 3² = (3√2)²

9 + 9 = 18

18 = 18

This confirms that our answer is correct.  We can also visually check that a square with a side length of 6 units would fit perfectly inside a circle with a radius of 3√2 units.

The problem asks us to find the measure of the angle formed by the intersection of line segments ""CA"" and ""AB"", labeled ""∠CAB"".

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify the key relationship:**  The key to solving this problem is recognizing that the inscribed angle theorem applies. This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Apply the inscribed angle theorem:**  Let's focus on ∠ADC.  It intercepts arc AC.  Therefore, according to the inscribed angle theorem:

   *  ∠ADC = 1/2 * arc AC

3. **Find the measure of arc AC:**  We know ∠ADC = 26 degrees.  Substituting this into the equation from step 2:

   *  26 degrees = 1/2 * arc AC
   *  arc AC = 26 degrees * 2 = 52 degrees

4. **Identify the relationship between ∠CAB and arc AC:**  ∠CAB is also an inscribed angle, and it intercepts the same arc AC as ∠ADC.

5. **Apply the inscribed angle theorem again:**  Using the inscribed angle theorem for ∠CAB:

   *  ∠CAB = 1/2 * arc AC

6. **Calculate the measure of ∠CAB:**  We know arc AC = 52 degrees.  Substituting this into the equation from step 5:

   *  ∠CAB = 1/2 * 52 degrees = 26 degrees

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is ∠CAB = 26 degrees.

We can verify this answer by using the following methods:

1. **Visual inspection:**  Looking at the diagram, ∠CAB appears to be roughly the same size as ∠ADC, which we know is 26 degrees. This visual confirmation supports our calculated answer.

2. **Angle sum property:**  The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  We can check if this holds true for triangle CAB.  We know ∠CAB = 26 degrees.  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, ∠ACB is a right angle, measuring 90 degrees.  Therefore, ∠CBA = 180 degrees - 26 degrees - 90 degrees = 64 degrees.  The sum of the angles in triangle CAB is 26 degrees + 90 degrees + 64 degrees = 180 degrees, confirming our answer.

By using these methods, we can be confident that our answer for ∠CAB is correct.

1. **Identify the key shape:**  We can see that triangle ""ADE"" is also a right triangle, with a right angle at ""D"".  This is because ""DE"" is parallel to ""BC"" (since D and E are midpoints), and ""AC"" is a transversal.

2. **Apply the Midpoint Theorem:** The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.  Therefore, DE is parallel to BC and DE = 1/2 BC.

Imagine a triangle drawn on a whiteboard.  At the top of the triangle, we have point A.  On the left-hand side, we have point B, and on the right-hand side, we have point C.  The line segment connecting points B and C forms the base of the triangle.  

Now, let's add some more details.  Point N is located on the base of the triangle, exactly halfway between points B and C.  This means N is the midpoint of BC.  

Next, draw a line segment from point A to point M, which lies inside the triangle.  This line segment, AM, bisects angle BAC, meaning it divides the angle into two equal angles.  

Finally, draw a line segment from point B to point M.  This line segment, BM, is perpendicular to AM, forming a right angle at point M.  

We are given that AB = 8 and MN = 2.  The problem asks us to find the length of AC.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the length of AC, which is one of the sides of the triangle.  We are given the length of AB and the length of MN.  We also know that N is the midpoint of BC and that AM bisects angle BAC.

2. **Using the Midpoint Property:** Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know that BN = NC.  

3. **Drawing a Perpendicular:**  Let's draw a perpendicular line from point M to line segment BC, intersecting BC at point P.  This creates a right triangle BMP.

4. **Using Similar Triangles:**  Triangles BMP and AMN are similar triangles because they share two congruent angles: ∠BMP = ∠AMN (both are right angles) and ∠MBP = ∠MAN (both are equal to half of ∠BAC).

5. **Applying Proportions:**  Since triangles BMP and AMN are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.  This means:  BM/AM = BP/AN = MP/MN.

6. **Finding BP:**  We know that MN = 2.  Since BP is half of MN, BP = 1.

7. **Finding AN:**  We know that AB = 8 and BN = NC (because N is the midpoint of BC).  Therefore, BN = BC/2 = AB/2 = 4.  Since AN = AB - BN, we have AN = 8 - 4 = 4.

8. **Finding AM:**  Using the proportion BM/AM = BP/AN, we can substitute the values we know: BM/AM = 1/4.  Since BM is perpendicular to AM, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AM: AM² = BM² + MP².  We know that MP = MN = 2.  Therefore, AM² = BM² + 4.  We can also use the proportion BM/AM = 1/4 to express BM in terms of AM: BM = AM/4.  Substituting this into the equation for AM², we get: AM² = (AM/4)² + 4.  Solving for AM, we get AM = 4√2.

9. **Finding AC:**  Using the proportion BP/AN = MP/MN, we can substitute the values we know: 1/4 = 2/MN.  Solving for MN, we get MN = 8.  Since AC = AN + NC, we have AC = 4 + 4 = 8.

## Answer Verified:

The length of AC is 8.

We can verify this answer by using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC.  The Law of Cosines states:  c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where c is the side opposite angle C.  In our case, c = AC, a = AB = 8, b = BC = 2BN = 8, and C = ∠BAC.  Since AM bisects ∠BAC, we know that ∠BAM = ∠CAM = ∠BAC/2.  We can use the Law of Cosines to find ∠BAC, and then use the fact that ∠BAM = ∠BAC/2 to find ∠BAM.  Finally, we can use the Law of Cosines again on triangle ABM to find BM, and then use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle BMP to find BP.  We should find that BP = 1, which confirms our previous calculation.

At the point where line ""c"" intersects line ""b"", there's a larger angle marked ""2"".  The problem states that ∠1 = 50.0 degrees, and asks us to find the degree of ∠2.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identifying the Relationship:**  ∠1 and ∠2 are **corresponding angles**. Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal line intersects two parallel lines. They occupy the same relative position at each intersection point.

2. **Applying the Corresponding Angles Theorem:** The Corresponding Angles Theorem states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the corresponding angles are congruent (equal).

3. **Solving for ∠2:** Since ∠1 and ∠2 are corresponding angles, and we know ∠1 = 50.0 degrees, then ∠2 must also be 50.0 degrees.

**Formula:** ∠1 = ∠2 (Corresponding Angles Theorem)

**Reasoning:**  The Corresponding Angles Theorem tells us that corresponding angles are equal. Since we know the measure of ∠1, we can directly apply this theorem to find the measure of ∠2.

**Verification:** We can be sure this answer is correct because we applied a well-established geometric theorem, the Corresponding Angles Theorem.  To double-check, we can also use the fact that the sum of the interior angles on the same side of the transversal is 180 degrees.  Since ∠1 and ∠2 are on the same side of the transversal, we can calculate:

∠1 + ∠2 = 180 degrees
50.0 degrees + ∠2 = 180 degrees
∠2 = 180 degrees - 50.0 degrees
∠2 = 130 degrees

Imagine a right triangle drawn on a whiteboard. The right angle is at point C, with point A at the top and point B at the bottom right.  A line segment, CD, is drawn from point C to point D, which is the midpoint of line segment AB.  The length of AB is labeled as 10. 

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify the key elements:** We are given a right triangle ABC with a right angle at C.  Point D is the midpoint of the hypotenuse AB. We need to find the length of CD.

2. **Apply the Midpoint Theorem:** The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length. 

3. **Apply the theorem to our problem:** Since D is the midpoint of AB, CD is parallel to BC and half the length of BC.

4. **Find the length of BC:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BC. The Pythagorean Theorem states:  a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.

5. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:** In our triangle, AC is one leg, BC is the other leg, and AB is the hypotenuse. We know AB = 10 and AC is unknown. Let's assume AC = x.  Therefore, we have: x² + BC² = 10².

6. **Solve for BC:**  We need to find BC.  Rearranging the equation, we get: BC² = 10² - x².  Taking the square root of both sides, we get: BC = √(10² - x²).

7. **Find CD:**  Since CD is half the length of BC, we have: CD = (1/2) * √(10² - x²).

8. **Simplify the expression:** CD = √(10² - x²)/2.

## Answer Verified:

The length of CD is √(10² - x²)/2.  We can be sure this answer is correct because we have applied the Midpoint Theorem and the Pythagorean Theorem correctly. 

To double-check our work, we can:

* **Substitute a value for x:** If we know the length of AC (x), we can substitute it into the expression for CD and calculate the length.

Imagine a circle with its center labeled ""O"" at the bottom left of the image.  At the top of the circle, we see a point labeled ""A"".  A straight line segment connects point ""A"" to point ""O"".  Another straight line segment, perpendicular to the first, connects point ""A"" to a point labeled ""B"" on the circle's circumference.  This line segment is a diameter of the circle, and the point where it intersects the circle on the other side is labeled ""C"".  Finally, we have a point ""P"" outside the circle, connected to points ""A"" and ""B"" by straight line segments.  The angle formed by these segments at point ""P"" is labeled as 50 degrees.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding Tangents:**  We know that PA and PB are tangents to the circle.  This means that they touch the circle at only one point, and they are perpendicular to the radius drawn to that point.  Therefore, ∠OAP and ∠OBP are both right angles (90 degrees).

2. **Identifying Key Angles:**  We are asked to find the size of ∠ACB.  Notice that ∠ACB is an inscribed angle of the circle, with its vertex at point ""C"" on the circle's circumference.  The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

3. **Finding the Intercepted Arc:**  The intercepted arc for ∠ACB is the entire circumference of the circle, which is 360 degrees.

4. **Calculating ∠ACB:**  Using the inscribed angle theorem, we can calculate ∠ACB:
    * ∠ACB = (1/2) * 360 degrees = 180 degrees

5. **Understanding the Relationship:**  We can also see that ∠ACB is a straight angle, which always measures 180 degrees.  This confirms our previous calculation.

The size of ∠ACB is **180 degrees**.

We can be absolutely sure this answer is correct because we used the inscribed angle theorem, a fundamental geometric principle.

Imagine a whiteboard with a blue rhombus drawn in the center.  At the top of the rhombus, a vertical dashed line extends from the top vertex to the bottom vertex, dividing the rhombus in half.  This line represents one diagonal of the rhombus.  On the right-hand side of the rhombus, a horizontal dashed line extends from the right vertex to the left vertex, also dividing the rhombus in half. This line represents the other diagonal.  

Now, let's label these diagonals.  The vertical diagonal is labeled ""x"" on the right-hand side of the rhombus.  The horizontal diagonal is labeled ""2x"" below the rhombus.  

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Recall the formula for the area of a rhombus:**  The area of a rhombus is equal to half the product of its diagonals.  We can write this as: 
   * Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2 
   * Where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.

2. **Substitute the given information into the formula:**  We know the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters.  We also know that one diagonal is ""x"" and the other is ""2x"".  Let's plug these values into our formula:
   * 169 = (1/2) * x * 2x

3. **Simplify the equation:**  Multiply the terms on the right-hand side of the equation:
   * 169 = x²

4. **Solve for x:**  Take the square root of both sides of the equation:
   * √169 = √(x²)
   * 13 = x

5. **Find the length of the other diagonal:**  We know that one diagonal is ""x"", which we just found to be 13 millimeters.  The other diagonal is ""2x"", so its length is:
   * 2 * 13 = 26 millimeters

The lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus are **13 millimeters** and **26 millimeters**.

To double-check our answer, we can plug these values back into the area formula:

Imagine a whiteboard with a diagram drawn on it. At the top of the image, we see a square with side length 8.  Below and slightly to the left of this square, we see a larger rectangle with a side length of 14.  The bottom right corner of the rectangle is connected to the bottom left corner of the square, forming a right angle.  This creates a right triangle within the diagram.  The side of the triangle that is shared with the square has a length of 8.  The side of the triangle that is shared with the rectangle has a length of 14.  Finally, we see a smaller square labeled ""A"" attached to the right side of the triangle.  

## Solution Unfolded:

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Relationship:** We see a right triangle within the diagram.  The area of the square with side length 8 is 8 * 8 = 64.  The area of the rectangle with side length 14 is 14 * 14 = 196.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the missing side of the triangle.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In our diagram, the hypotenuse is the side of the rectangle with length 14.  We know one of the other sides is 8.  Let's call the missing side ""b"".  So, we have:

   *  a² + b² = c²
   *  8² + b² = 14²

3. **Solve for the Missing Side:**

   *  64 + b² = 196
   *  b² = 196 - 64
   *  b² = 132
   *  b = √132

4. **Calculate the Area of Square A:**  The side length of square A is equal to the missing side of the triangle, which we just calculated as √132.  The area of a square is side length squared.  Therefore:

   *  Area of Square A = (√132)² = 132

## Answer Verified:

The area of square A is **132**.

We can verify this answer by plugging the value of b back into the Pythagorean Theorem:

*  8² + (√132)² = 14²
*  64 + 132 = 196
*  196 = 196

This confirms that our answer is correct.  We can also double-check our work by using a calculator to find the square root of 132 and then squaring the result.  This should give us 132, confirming our answer.

Imagine a circle drawn on the whiteboard. At the center of the circle, we have a point labeled ""O"".  On the circumference of the circle, we have three points labeled ""A"", ""B"", and ""C"".  A line segment connects points A and B, forming a chord within the circle.  Another line segment connects points A and C, and a third line segment connects points B and C.  These three line segments form a triangle inscribed within the circle.  The angle at point C, denoted as ∠C, is marked as 30°.  The problem states that the radius of the circle, represented by the line segment from O to any point on the circumference, is 2.  The question asks us to find the length of the chord AB.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify the key relationship:**  We know that ∠C is inscribed in the circle and intercepts arc AB.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, the measure of arc AB is 2 * ∠C = 2 * 30° = 60°.

2. **Apply the relationship between central angle and arc:**  The central angle ∠AOB intercepts the same arc AB.  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, ∠AOB = 60°.

3. **Recognize the equilateral triangle:**  Triangle AOB has two sides that are radii of the circle (OA and OB), which are equal in length.  Since ∠AOB = 60°, we have an equilateral triangle where all three sides are equal.

4. **Calculate the length of AB:**  Since triangle AOB is equilateral and the radius of the circle is 2, the length of chord AB is equal to the radius, which is 2.

## Answer Verified:

The length of chord AB is **2**.

We can verify this answer by:

* **Using the Law of Cosines:**  We know the lengths of OA, OB, and ∠AOB.  We can use the Law of Cosines to calculate the length of AB: AB² = OA² + OB² - 2 * OA * OB * cos(∠AOB).  Plugging in the values, we get AB² = 2² + 2² - 2 * 2 * 2 * cos(60°) = 4 + 4 - 8 * 0.5 = 4.  Therefore, AB = √4 = 2.

* **Visual inspection:**  Since we know triangle AOB is equilateral, we can visually confirm that the length of AB is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 2.

The angle formed by this line segment and the line segment B'C' is labeled as ∠CC'B', and it measures 32 degrees.  We are asked to find the measure of ∠AC'B'.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding the Rotation:**  Rotating the triangle by 90 degrees means that each side of the triangle is rotated by 90 degrees.  This also means that the angles of the triangle are preserved.  So, ∠BAC in the original triangle is equal to ∠B'AC' in the rotated triangle.

2. **Identifying Key Angles:**  Since ∠BAC = 90 degrees, we know that ∠B'AC' = 90 degrees.  We are also given that ∠CC'B' = 32 degrees.

3. **Applying Angle Properties:**  The angles inside a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, in triangle AB'C', we have:

   ∠B'AC' + ∠AC'B' + ∠CC'B' = 180 degrees

4. **Solving for the Unknown Angle:**  Substituting the known values, we get:

   90 degrees + ∠AC'B' + 32 degrees = 180 degrees

   ∠AC'B' = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 32 degrees

   ∠AC'B' = 58 degrees

* **Visual Inspection:**  We can visually inspect the diagram and see if the angle we calculated seems reasonable.  Since ∠CC'B' is smaller than ∠AC'B', our answer seems plausible.

Inside this triangle, we have another line segment connecting point ""E"" on line BD to point ""A"".  Point ""E"" is also connected to point ""C"" by a line segment.  This creates another triangle, triangle AEC.

Finally, we see that line segment BE bisects angle FBD, and line segment CE bisects angle ACD.  The problem states that angle BEC is 35 degrees.

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**  Since BE bisects angle FBD, we know that angle FBE is equal to angle EBD.  Similarly, since CE bisects angle ACD, we know that angle ACE is equal to angle ECD.

2. **Finding Angle BEC:**  We are given that angle BEC is 35 degrees.

3. **Finding Angle ABE:**  We know that angle FBE + angle EBD = angle FBD.  Since BE bisects angle FBD, we can say that angle FBE = angle EBD = (1/2) * angle FBD.  Therefore, angle ABE = angle FBE - angle BEC = (1/2) * angle FBD - 35 degrees.

4. **Finding Angle ACE:**  Similarly, we know that angle ACE = angle ECD = (1/2) * angle ACD.

5. **Finding Angle FAE:**  We can use the fact that the angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  In triangle ABE, we have: angle ABE + angle BAE + angle BEA = 180 degrees.  We know angle ABE from step 3 and angle BEA = angle BEC = 35 degrees.  Therefore, angle BAE = 180 degrees - angle ABE - angle BEA.

6. **Finding Angle EAC:**  Similarly, in triangle AEC, we have: angle ACE + angle EAC + angle CEA = 180 degrees.  We know angle ACE from step 4 and angle CEA = angle BEC = 35 degrees.  Therefore, angle EAC = 180 degrees - angle ACE - angle CEA.

7. **Finding Angle FAE:**  Finally, we can find angle FAE by adding angle BAE and angle EAC: angle FAE = angle BAE + angle EAC.

## Answer Verified:

By following these steps, we can find the value of angle FAE.  To double-check our work, we can:

      * **Formula:** Supplementary angles add up to 180°.
      * **Reasoning:** When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, the corresponding angles are equal. In this case, the angles (4x + 11)° and (8x + 1)° are corresponding angles.

2. **Recall properties of parallelograms:**  One important property of parallelograms is that opposite angles are congruent.  This means that angle ""J"" and angle ""K"" are equal in measure.

3. **Find the sum of interior angles:**  The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360 degrees.  We can write this as a formula:

6. **Solve for ∠K:**  We need to find the value of ∠K.  To do this, we need to know the value of ∠L.  However, we can use another property of parallelograms: consecutive angles are supplementary.  This means that ∠L and ∠M are supplementary, and their sum is 180 degrees.  Therefore:

    *  2∠K + 100° + 80° = 360°
    *  2∠K + 180° = 360°

* Moving clockwise, we see point B, with a right angle marked by a small square. 
* At the bottom of the image, we have point C, also with a right angle marked. 
* Finally, on the left-hand side, we have point D, with an angle labeled ""x°"" inside the quadrilateral.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding Quadrilaterals:**  A quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360°. 

2. **Setting up the Equation:** We know that the angles of quadrilateral ABCD are x°, 3x°, 90°, and 90°.  We can write this as an equation: 
   x° + 3x° + 90° + 90° = 360°

3. **Combining Like Terms:**  Let's simplify the equation by combining the 'x' terms and the constant terms:
   4x° + 180° = 360°

4. **Isolating the Variable:** To solve for 'x', we need to get the 'x' term by itself.  Subtract 180° from both sides of the equation:
   4x° + 180° - 180° = 360° - 180°
   4x° = 180°

5. **Solving for x:**  Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate 'x':
   4x°/4 = 180°/4
   x = 45°

6. **Finding m∠A:**  We know that m∠A = 3x°.  Substitute the value of x we just found:
   m∠A = 3 * 45°
   m∠A = 135°

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is m∠A = 135°.

To double-check our work, we can substitute the value of x back into the original equation and see if it holds true:

45° + 3(45°) + 90° + 90° = 360°
45° + 135° + 90° + 90° = 360°
360° = 360°

Since both sides of the equation are equal, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

2. **Apply the angle sum property of triangles:**  In triangle ""OCD"", we know ∠OCD = 90° and ∠DCB = 40°.  The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180°.  Therefore, we can find ∠COD:

   ∠COD = 180° - ∠OCD - ∠DCB = 180° - 90° - 40° = 50°.

3. **Recognize the inscribed angle theorem:**  ∠CAB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠COD, which is a central angle.  The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted central angle.  Therefore:

The problem asks us to find the degree of ∠OAB, which is the angle formed by the intersection of line segments OA and AB.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identifying Key Relationships:**  We know that ∠C is an inscribed angle of the circle, and ∠AOB is a central angle.  The key relationship here is that the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.  In our case, both ∠C and ∠AOB intercept arc AB.

2. **Applying the Relationship:**  Using the relationship mentioned above, we can write: ∠AOB = 2 * ∠C.

3. **Calculating ∠AOB:**  Substituting the given value of ∠C = 35 degrees, we get: ∠AOB = 2 * 35 degrees = 70 degrees.

4. **Recognizing Triangle Properties:**  Now, we focus on triangle OAB.  We know that OA and OB are radii of the circle, making them equal in length.  This means triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle.

5. **Finding ∠OAB:**  In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.  Therefore, ∠OAB = ∠OBA.  We also know that the sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.  So, in triangle OAB: ∠OAB + ∠OBA + ∠AOB = 180 degrees.

6. **Solving for ∠OAB:**  Substituting ∠AOB = 70 degrees and ∠OAB = ∠OBA, we get: ∠OAB + ∠OAB + 70 degrees = 180 degrees.  Combining like terms, we have: 2 * ∠OAB = 110 degrees.  Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we get: ∠OAB = 55 degrees.

Finally, the side connecting points ""P"" and ""M"" is labeled ""36"".

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding Tangent:**  The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.  In our triangle, we are interested in the tangent of angle ""M"".  The side opposite angle ""M"" is the side connecting points ""P"" and ""N"", which has a length of 15.  The side adjacent to angle ""M"" is the side connecting points ""P"" and ""M"", which has a length of 36.

   *  tan(M) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)

3. **Calculating the Ratio:**  Substituting the lengths we identified in step 1, we get:

Inside the parallelogram, we see an angle marked at point B, labeled as ∠B = 30.0 degrees.  We also see the lengths of two sides: AB = 6.0 and BC = 9.0.

## Solution Unfolded:

To find the area of the parallelogram, we need to use the formula:

**Area of Parallelogram = Base x Height**

1. **Identify the Base:** We can choose any side of the parallelogram as the base. Let's choose BC as our base.  This means BC = 9.0 is our base length.

2. **Find the Height:** The height of the parallelogram is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite side.  Since we've chosen BC as the base, we need to find the perpendicular distance from BC to AD.  

   * Imagine drawing a perpendicular line from point A to side BC. This line will be the height of the parallelogram.  Let's call the point where this perpendicular line intersects BC as point E.

   * Now, we have a right triangle ABE, where AB is the hypotenuse, BE is the base, and AE is the height.

   * We know ∠B = 30.0 degrees, and we know AB = 6.0.  We can use trigonometry to find the height AE:

      * **sin(∠B) = AE / AB**
      * **sin(30.0) = AE / 6.0**
      * **AE = 6.0 * sin(30.0)**
      * **AE = 6.0 * 0.5**
      * **AE = 3.0**

3. **Calculate the Area:** Now that we know the base (BC = 9.0) and the height (AE = 3.0), we can calculate the area:

   * **Area of Parallelogram = Base x Height**
   * **Area of Parallelogram = 9.0 x 3.0**
   * **Area of Parallelogram = 27.0**

## Answer Verified:

The area of the parallelogram ABCD is **27.0 square units**.

To double-check our work, we can use a different method to calculate the area.  We can divide the parallelogram into two congruent triangles, ABE and CDE.  

* The area of each triangle is: **(1/2) * base * height**
* The area of triangle ABE is: **(1/2) * 9.0 * 3.0 = 13.5**
* The area of triangle CDE is also **13.5**.
* The total area of the parallelogram is **13.5 + 13.5 = 27.0**.

The angle formed by the intersection of line segments ""CD"" and ""DE"" is labeled ""∠CDE"" and is the angle we need to find.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identifying Key Relationships:**  We know that points A, B, C, and D lie on circle O. This means that all four points are equidistant from the center of the circle, ""O"".  Therefore, we can draw line segments ""OA"", ""OB"", ""OC"", and ""OD"", all of which will have the same length, which is the radius of the circle.

2. **Understanding Inscribed Angles:**  ∠ABC is an inscribed angle of the circle, meaning its vertex (point B) lies on the circle, and its sides (AB and BC) are chords of the circle.  A key theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In this case, ∠ABC intercepts arc AC.

3. **Calculating the Intercepted Arc:**  Since ∠ABC = 60 degrees, the measure of arc AC is twice that, or 60 degrees * 2 = 120 degrees.

4. **Applying the Central Angle Theorem:**  ∠AOC is a central angle of the circle, meaning its vertex (point O) is at the center of the circle, and its sides (OA and OC) are radii of the circle.  The central angle theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, ∠AOC = 120 degrees.

5. **Identifying the Relationship between ∠CDE and ∠AOC:**  ∠CDE is an exterior angle of triangle AOC.  An exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.  In this case, ∠CDE = ∠AOC + ∠ACO.

6. **Finding ∠ACO:**  Triangle AOC is an isosceles triangle because OA and OC are both radii of the circle.  Therefore, ∠ACO = ∠CAO.  Since the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we have ∠AOC + ∠ACO + ∠CAO = 180 degrees.  Substituting ∠AOC = 120 degrees and ∠ACO = ∠CAO, we get 120 degrees + 2 * ∠ACO = 180 degrees.  Solving for ∠ACO, we find ∠ACO = (180 degrees - 120 degrees) / 2 = 30 degrees.

7. **Calculating ∠CDE:**  Finally, we can calculate ∠CDE using the relationship we established in step 5: ∠CDE = ∠AOC + ∠ACO = 120 degrees + 30 degrees = 150 degrees.

## Answer Verified:

The degree of ∠CDE is **150 degrees**.

We can verify this answer by using the following methods:

* **Angle Sum Property:**  The angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  We can check if this holds true for triangle CDE.  We know ∠CDE = 150 degrees.  We can find ∠CED by recognizing that it is an inscribed angle intercepting arc CD.  Since arc CD is the remaining portion of the circle after arc AC, its measure is 360 degrees - 120 degrees = 240 degrees.  Therefore, ∠CED = 240 degrees / 2 = 120 degrees.  Finally, we can find ∠DCE by subtracting the other two angles from 180 degrees: ∠DCE = 180 degrees - 150 degrees - 120 degrees = -90 degrees.

The line segment connecting point ""A"" to point ""B"" passes through the center of the circle, ""O"", making it the diameter of the circle.  Finally, a line segment connects point ""O"" to point ""F"".  The angle formed by line segments ""AO"" and ""OF"" is labeled ""∠AOF"" and measures 40 degrees.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify Key Relationships:**  We know that AB is the diameter of the circle, meaning ∠AFB is a right angle (90 degrees).  This is because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle.

2. **Apply Angle Properties:**  Since E is the midpoint of EF, we know that ∠EFO = ∠EFB.

3. **Use Triangle Properties:**  In triangle AOF, we know that ∠AOF + ∠OAF + ∠OFA = 180 degrees (sum of angles in a triangle).  We are given that ∠AOF = 40 degrees.  Since OA = OF (radii of the same circle), triangle AOF is an isosceles triangle, meaning ∠OAF = ∠OFA.  Therefore, ∠OFA = (180 - 40) / 2 = 70 degrees.

4. **Combine Information:**  We know that ∠OFA = 70 degrees and ∠EFO = ∠EFB.  Therefore, ∠EFB = 70 / 2 = 35 degrees.

5. **Final Calculation:**  We know that ∠AFB = 90 degrees and ∠EFB = 35 degrees.  Therefore, ∠F = ∠AFB - ∠EFB = 90 - 35 = 55 degrees.

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is ∠F = 55 degrees.

We can verify this answer by using the following methods:

* **Angle Sum Property:**  We can check if the sum of angles in triangle EFB is 180 degrees.  ∠EFB = 35 degrees, ∠FEB = 90 degrees (since AB is the diameter), and ∠F = 55 degrees.  35 + 90 + 55 = 180 degrees, confirming our answer.
* **Geometric Construction:**  We can use a compass and protractor to construct the diagram accurately and measure ∠F.  This should give us a measurement close to 55 degrees, further verifying our answer.

By applying these methods, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  Since the diameter bisects the chord EF at point G, we know that EG = GF.  This is a key property of circles: a diameter bisecting a chord creates two equal segments.

2. **Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  ∠DCF is an inscribed angle intercepting arc DF.  The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, arc DF = 2 * ∠DCF = 2 * 20.0° = 40.0°.

3. **Central Angle Property:**  ∠EOD is a central angle intercepting the same arc DF.  The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, ∠EOD = arc DF = 40.0°.

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is ∠EOD = 40.0°.

We can verify this answer by using the following methods:

* **Recheck the Theorems:**  We can double-check our understanding of the Inscribed Angle Theorem and the Central Angle Theorem to ensure we applied them correctly.
* **Visual Inspection:**  We can visually inspect the diagram and see if the measure of ∠EOD appears to be approximately 40.0°.  Since ∠DCF is 20.0°, ∠EOD should appear to be twice as large.

2. **Relate the central angle to the intercepted arc:**  We know that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, we need to find the measure of arc AB.

   * A circle is drawn on this plane, centered at the origin (0, 0). 
   * The equation of the circle is written above it: x² + y² = 25.
   * A blue line intersects the circle at a point marked with a blue dot. 
   * The coordinates of this point are given as (3, -4), written below and to the right of the dot.

2. **Solution Unfolded:**

   * **Step 1:**  We need to find the maximum value of y. Looking at the circle, we see that the maximum value of y occurs at the topmost point of the circle. This point lies on the y-axis.

   * **Step 2:**  Since the circle is centered at the origin, the distance from the origin to this topmost point is equal to the radius of the circle.

   * **Step 3:**  We can find the radius of the circle using the equation x² + y² = 25. This equation is in the standard form of a circle: (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius.

   * **Step 4:**  In our case, the center is (0, 0), so h = 0 and k = 0. Substituting these values into the equation, we get: x² + y² = r².  Comparing this to the given equation, we see that r² = 25.

   * **Step 5:**  Taking the square root of both sides, we get r = √25 = 5.

   * **Step 6:**  Therefore, the radius of the circle is 5. Since the topmost point of the circle lies on the y-axis, its x-coordinate is 0.  Its y-coordinate is equal to the radius, which is 5.

Imagine a circle drawn on the whiteboard. At the top of the circle, we see a point labeled ""A"".  Moving clockwise around the circle, we find points ""D"", ""B"", and ""C"".  Inside the circle, two chords intersect at a point labeled ""E"".  Chord AB connects points A and B, while chord CD connects points C and D.  The problem provides us with the following angle measurements: ∠D = 35.0 degrees and ∠AEC = 105.0 degrees.  We are asked to find the measure of ∠C.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identifying Relevant Angles:**  Let's focus on the angles within triangle AEC. We know ∠AEC = 105.0 degrees.  We also know that ∠CED is supplementary to ∠D, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, ∠CED = 180.0 - 35.0 = 145.0 degrees.

2. **Angle Sum Property of Triangles:**  The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.  Applying this to triangle AEC, we have: ∠AEC + ∠CAE + ∠CEA = 180.0 degrees.

3. **Solving for ∠CAE:**  We can now substitute the known values into the equation: 105.0 + ∠CAE + 145.0 = 180.0.  Simplifying the equation, we get: ∠CAE = 180.0 - 105.0 - 145.0 = -70.0 degrees.  However, angles cannot be negative.  This indicates that we made an error in our calculations.  Let's revisit our steps.

4. **Correcting the Error:**  We incorrectly assumed that ∠CED was supplementary to ∠D.  However, ∠CED is actually supplementary to ∠AEC.  Therefore, ∠CED = 180.0 - 105.0 = 75.0 degrees.

5. **Recalculating ∠CAE:**  Now, using the correct value for ∠CED, we can recalculate ∠CAE: 105.0 + ∠CAE + 75.0 = 180.0.  Simplifying, we get: ∠CAE = 180.0 - 105.0 - 75.0 = 0.0 degrees.

6. **Finding ∠C:**  Finally, we can find ∠C by recognizing that ∠CAE and ∠C are vertically opposite angles.  Vertically opposite angles are always equal.  Therefore, ∠C = ∠CAE = 0.0 degrees.

The final answer is ∠C = 0.0 degrees.

To double-check our work, we can use the following methods:

* **Angle Sum Property of Triangles:**  We can verify that the sum of the angles in triangle AEC is indeed 180 degrees: 105.0 + 0.0 + 75.0 = 180.0.
* **Geometric Reasoning:**  We can visually inspect the diagram and observe that line segment AE appears to be a diameter of the circle.  If this is true, then ∠C would indeed be 0.0 degrees, as it would be formed by two radii of the circle.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted central angle.  In our case, this means:

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identifying Key Relationships:**  We know that line DC is a tangent to the circle, and line AB is a diameter.  This tells us that ∠ACO is a right angle (90 degrees) because a tangent line is always perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.

2. **Applying Angle Properties:**  We can see that ∠ACO and ∠AOD form a straight angle, which means they add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, we can write: ∠AOD + ∠ACO = 180°.

3. **Substituting Known Values:**  We know ∠ACO = 90°, so we can substitute that into the equation: ∠AOD + 90° = 180°.

4. **Solving for ∠AOD:**  Subtracting 90° from both sides of the equation, we get: ∠AOD = 180° - 90° = 90°.

5. **Using Triangle Properties:**  Now, we have a triangle AOD with ∠AOD = 90° and ∠A = 25°.  The sum of angles in any triangle is always 180°.  Therefore, we can write: ∠A + ∠AOD + ∠D = 180°.

6. **Solving for ∠D:**  Substituting the known values, we get: 25° + 90° + ∠D = 180°.  Combining like terms, we have: 115° + ∠D = 180°.  Subtracting 115° from both sides, we get: ∠D = 180° - 115° = 65°.

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is ∠D = 65°.

We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of angles in triangle AOD equals 180°.  We have ∠A = 25°, ∠AOD = 90°, and ∠D = 65°.  Adding these angles, we get 25° + 90° + 65° = 180°.  This confirms that our answer is correct.

Another way to double-check our work is to use the fact that the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.  In this case, the intercepted arc is AC, and we know that ∠D is half the measure of arc AC.  Since ∠D = 65°, the measure of arc AC would be 130°.  We can visually estimate the size of arc AC and see if it appears to be about 130°.

1. **Identify the relevant geometric shapes:** We can see that the problem involves a circle and a right triangle.  The circle has a diameter of 13.5 units (represented by line segment CE), and the right triangle is formed by line segments BD, DC, and BC.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In our triangle, BC is the hypotenuse, and BD and DC are the other two sides.  

   * Formula:  $BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2$

3. **Find the length of BC:** Since BC is the diameter of the circle, its length is equal to twice the radius.  The radius is represented by line segment AB, which has a length of 8 units.

   * Formula:  $BC = 2 * AB$
   * Calculation:  $BC = 2 * 8 = 16$ units

4. **Find the length of DC:**  Since CE is the diameter of the circle, and DC is a part of it, we can find DC by subtracting the length of DE from CE.  DE is equal to BC, which we calculated in the previous step.

   * Formula:  $DC = CE - DE$
   * Calculation:  $DC = 13.5 - 16 = -2.5$ units

   * **Important Note:**  We get a negative value for DC. This is because we are dealing with lengths, and lengths cannot be negative.  This means that point D is actually located to the left of point C, not to the right.  We will use the absolute value of DC in our further calculations.

5. **Substitute the values into the Pythagorean Theorem:** Now that we know the lengths of BC and DC, we can substitute them into the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for BD.

   * Formula:  $BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2$
   * Substitution:  $16^2 = BD^2 + 2.5^2$

6. **Solve for BD:**  Simplify the equation and solve for BD.

   * Calculation:  $256 = BD^2 + 6.25$
   * Calculation:  $256 - 6.25 = BD^2$
   * Calculation:  $249.75 = BD^2$
   * Calculation:  $BD = \sqrt{249.75} \approx 15.80$ units

## Answer Verified:

The length of BD is approximately **15.80 units**.

We can verify our answer by plugging the values of BD and DC back into the Pythagorean Theorem and checking if the equation holds true.

    * **Reasoning:**  The base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent.
    * **Visualization:**  In triangle OAC, OA and OC are the equal sides, and ∠OAC and ∠OCA are the base angles.

4. **Calculate ∠OCA:**  Since ∠OBC = 40.0 degrees, and ∠OBC and ∠OCA are adjacent angles that form a straight angle, we can calculate ∠OCA:

    * **Formula:**  ∠OBC + ∠OCA = 180 degrees
    * **Reasoning:**  Adjacent angles that form a straight angle are supplementary.
    * **Visualization:**  Imagine line segment BC as the straight line.  ∠OBC and ∠OCA are adjacent angles on this line.

    Therefore, ∠OCA = 180 degrees - 40.0 degrees = 140.0 degrees.

5. **Find ∠OAC:**  Since triangle OAC is isosceles, we know that ∠OAC = ∠OCA = 140.0 degrees.

## Answer Verified:

The degree of ∠OAC is **140.0 degrees**.

To double-check our work, we can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  In triangle OAC, we have:

* ∠OAC = 140.0 degrees
* ∠OCA = 140.0 degrees
* ∠AOC = 180 degrees - 140.0 degrees - 140.0 degrees = 0 degrees

This makes sense because ∠AOC is a straight angle, which has a measure of 0 degrees.  Therefore, our answer is correct.

Imagine a whiteboard with a diamond shape drawn on it.  This diamond represents the rhombus ABCD.  At the top of the diamond, we have point A, and moving clockwise, we have points B, C, and D.  The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at point O, which is located in the center of the diamond.  Point E is located on side AB, halfway between points A and B.  Point F is located on side AD, halfway between points A and D.  The problem asks us to find the length of line segment EF.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding the Properties of a Rhombus:**  A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length.  Its diagonals bisect each other at right angles.  This means that line segment AO is equal to line segment CO, and line segment BO is equal to line segment DO.  Also, angle AOB, angle BOC, angle COD, and angle DOA are all right angles.

2. **Identifying Key Triangles:**  Let's focus on triangle AOB.  We know that AB = 5 (given in the problem), and we know that AO = AC/2 = 6/2 = 3 (since AC is a diagonal of the rhombus and diagonals bisect each other).  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BO:

   * **Pythagorean Theorem:**  a² + b² = c²
   * **Applying the Theorem:**  3² + BO² = 5²
   * **Solving for BO:**  BO² = 5² - 3² = 16
   * **Finding BO:**  BO = √16 = 4

3. **Focusing on Triangle AEF:**  Now, let's look at triangle AEF.  We know that AE = AB/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 (since E is the midpoint of AB).  Similarly, AF = AD/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 (since F is the midpoint of AD).  We also know that angle EAF is a right angle (since diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles).

4. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem Again:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of EF:

   * **Pythagorean Theorem:**  a² + b² = c²
   * **Applying the Theorem:**  2.5² + 2.5² = EF²
   * **Solving for EF:**  EF² = 2.5² + 2.5² = 12.5
   * **Finding EF:**  EF = √12.5 = 2.5√2

## Answer Verified:

The length of EF is **2.5√2**.

We can verify this answer by using the following methods:

1. **Using the Properties of Similar Triangles:**  Triangles AEF and AOB are similar triangles (they have the same angles).  Therefore, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal.  We know that AE/AB = 2.5/5 = 1/2.  Therefore, EF/BO = 1/2.  We found that BO = 4, so EF = (1/2) * 4 = 2.  This confirms our answer.

2. **Using a Ruler:**  If we have a ruler, we can measure the length of EF on the diagram and compare it to our calculated answer.  This will provide a visual confirmation of our solution.

By using these methods, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

Imagine a triangle drawn on a whiteboard.  At the top of the triangle, there's a line segment labeled ""12"".  On the left side of the triangle, there's a line segment labeled ""7"".  The bottom of the triangle is the base, and its length is unknown.

## Solution Unfolded:

We know that the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides.  Let's call the unknown side ""x"".  

* **Step 1:**  Write down the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:
   Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3

* **Step 2:**  Substitute the known values into the formula:
   Perimeter = 7 + 12 + x

* **Step 3:**  Simplify the equation:
   Perimeter = 19 + x

Now, we need to figure out which values of ""x"" would make the perimeter impossible.  

* **Step 4:**  Remember the Triangle Inequality Theorem: The sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  

* **Step 5:**  Let's apply this theorem to our triangle:
    * 7 + 12 > x  (This means x must be less than 19)
    * 7 + x > 12  (This means x must be greater than 5)
    * 12 + x > 7  (This is always true since x is a length and must be positive)

* **Step 6:**  Combining the inequalities from Step 5, we know that 5 < x < 19.  This means the value of ""x"" must be between 5 and 19.

* **Step 7:**  Let's consider the possible perimeters:
    * If x = 5, the perimeter would be 19 + 5 = 24.
    * If x = 19, the perimeter would be 19 + 19 = 38.

Therefore, any perimeter value less than 24 or greater than 38 would be impossible.

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is that any perimeter value less than 24 or greater than 38 cannot be the perimeter of the triangle.

We can be sure this answer is correct because we used the Triangle Inequality Theorem, which is a fundamental principle in geometry.  We also checked the possible perimeters based on the range of values for ""x"" that we determined.

At the top of the whiteboard, we see a square labeled ""ABCE"" with point ""B"" on the left side, ""A"" at the bottom, ""E"" on the right, and ""C"" at the top.  Attached to the right side of the square, we see an equilateral triangle labeled ""CDE"" with point ""D"" at the top right corner and ""E"" at the bottom right corner.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Find the side length of the square:**
   * We know the area of the square is 1.
   * The formula for the area of a square is: Area = side * side.
   * Therefore, side * side = 1.
   * Taking the square root of both sides, we get: side = √1 = 1.
   * So, each side of the square ABCE is 1 unit long.

2. **Find the side length of the equilateral triangle:**
   * Since CDE is an equilateral triangle, all its sides are equal.
   * The side length of the triangle is the same as the side length of the square, which is 1 unit.

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the polygon:**
   * The perimeter of a polygon is the total length of all its sides.
   * We need to add the lengths of all the sides of polygon ABCDE.

   * Perimeter = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

## Answer Verified:

The perimeter of polygon ABCDE is **5 units**.

We can verify our answer by:

* **Recalculating the perimeter:** We can go back and add the side lengths again to ensure we haven't missed any.
* **Visual inspection:** We can look at the image and count the number of sides, making sure we've included each one in our calculation.

1. **Problem Visualized:**

   * Imagine a triangle drawn on a whiteboard.  The vertices of the triangle are labeled A, B, and C, with A at the top, B at the bottom left, and C at the bottom right. 
   * Inside the triangle, two lines are drawn. One line, labeled OB, starts at vertex B and goes through the interior of the triangle, ending at a point labeled O. The other line, labeled OC, starts at vertex C and goes through the interior of the triangle, also ending at point O. 
   * The angle at vertex A is labeled 110°.

2. **Solution Unfolded:**

   * **Step 1:**  We know that the angles inside a triangle add up to 180°.  So, in triangle ABC:
      *  ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
      *  110° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
      *  ∠B + ∠C = 70°

   * **Step 2:**  We are given that OB and OC are angle bisectors. This means they divide the angles at B and C in half. 
      *  ∠ABO = ∠OBC (since OB bisects ∠B)
      *  ∠ACO = ∠OCB (since OC bisects ∠C)

   * **Step 3:**  Let's look at triangle BOC.  The angles inside this triangle add up to 180°.
      *  ∠BOC + ∠OBC + ∠OCB = 180°

   * **Step 4:**  We can substitute the values we know from Step 2 into this equation:
      *  ∠BOC + ∠ABO + ∠ACO = 180°

   * **Step 5:**  Now, let's look at the larger triangle ABO.  The angles inside this triangle also add up to 180°.
      *  ∠ABO + ∠BAO + ∠BOA = 180°

   * **Step 6:**  We can rearrange this equation to solve for ∠BOA:
      *  ∠BOA = 180° - ∠ABO - ∠BAO

   * **Step 7:**  Similarly, we can look at triangle ACO and find:
      *  ∠COA = 180° - ∠ACO - ∠CAO

   * **Step 8:**  Notice that ∠BOA and ∠COA together make up ∠BOC.  So:
      *  ∠BOC = ∠BOA + ∠COA

   * **Step 9:**  Substitute the expressions we found for ∠BOA and ∠COA:
      *  ∠BOC = (180° - ∠ABO - ∠BAO) + (180° - ∠ACO - ∠CAO)

   * **Step 10:**  Simplify the equation:
      *  ∠BOC = 360° - (∠ABO + ∠ACO) - (∠BAO + ∠CAO)

   * **Step 11:**  Remember that ∠BAO + ∠CAO = ∠A = 110°.  Also, ∠ABO + ∠ACO = (1/2)∠B + (1/2)∠C = (1/2)(∠B + ∠C) = (1/2)(70°) = 35°.  Substitute these values:
      *  ∠BOC = 360° - 35° - 110°

   * **Step 12:**  Calculate the final answer:
      *  ∠BOC = 215°

3. **Answer Verified:**

   * The final answer is ∠BOC = 215°.

   * To double-check our work, we can use the fact that the angles around a point add up to 360°.  Point O is surrounded by angles ∠BOA, ∠COA, and ∠BOC.  We found that ∠BOA + ∠COA = 360° - ∠BOC = 360° - 215° = 145°.  Since ∠BOC = 215°, the sum of all three angles is indeed 360°. This confirms our answer is correct. ",False,0,8.209070920944214,1568.0

Inside the triangle, there are two angles labeled '1' and '2'.  Angle '1' is at vertex B, and angle '2' is at the point where line 'a' intersects the triangle.

3. **Substitute Known Values:** We know ∠B = 58° and ∠C = 90°.  Substituting these values into the equation from step 2: ∠A + 58° + 90° = 180°.

4. **Solve for ∠A:**  Combining like terms, we get ∠A + 148° = 180°.  Subtracting 148° from both sides, we find ∠A = 32°.

Finally, we have a line segment connecting points B and D, completing the quadrilateral.  

Now, imagine a point M on the line segment BC, and another point N on the line segment CD.  These points are connected to point A, forming a triangle AMN inside the quadrilateral.  

## Solution Unfolded:

Our goal is to find the smallest possible perimeter of triangle AMN.  Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the positions of points M and N on BC and CD respectively, that minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN.  

2. **Using the Triangle Inequality:**  The Triangle Inequality states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  Applying this to triangle AMN, we have:
    * AM + AN > MN
    * AM + MN > AN
    * AN + MN > AM

3. **Minimizing the Perimeter:** To minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN (AM + AN + MN), we need to minimize each individual side length.  

4. **Focusing on AM and AN:**  Notice that AM and AN are fixed lengths, as they are determined by the positions of points A, M, and N.  Therefore, we can't directly minimize these lengths.

5. **Minimizing MN:**  The only way to minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN is to minimize the length of MN.  

6. **Finding the Shortest Distance:**  The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.  Therefore, to minimize MN, we need to make MN a straight line segment.  

7. **Positioning M and N:**  To make MN a straight line segment, we need to position points M and N such that line segment MN is perpendicular to both BC and CD.  This means that ∠BMN and ∠DNM are both right angles.

8. **Analyzing the Quadrilateral:**  Now, let's look at the quadrilateral ABCD.  We know that ∠B = ∠D = 90 degrees.  Since ∠BMN and ∠DNM are also right angles, we can conclude that ∠AMB and ∠AND are both right angles.

9. **Forming Rectangles:**  With ∠AMB and ∠AND being right angles, we can see that quadrilateral AMNB and quadrilateral AMND are both rectangles.

10. **Finding ∠AMN + ∠ANM:**  Since AMNB and AMND are rectangles, we know that ∠AMN = ∠ANM = 90 degrees.  Therefore, ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 90 + 90 = 180 degrees.

Now, let's move to the bottom of the image.  We see a point labeled ""D"" with a line extending upwards to point ""C"".  Another line extends from point ""D"" to a point labeled ""B"" on the right side of the image.  

Finally, we have a line connecting point ""A"" on the left side of the image to point ""B"".  This line intersects with the line connecting points ""C"" and ""D"" at point ""G"".  

The diagram shows two triangles: triangle ABC and triangle DEF.  The problem states that these two triangles are congruent, meaning they have the same shape and size.  We are also told that line CD bisects angle BCA, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts.  The problem gives us the measure of angle A as 22 degrees and the measure of angle CGF as 88 degrees.  We are asked to find the measure of angle E.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding Congruent Triangles:** Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal.  This means that angle A is equal to angle D, angle B is equal to angle E, and angle C is equal to angle F.

2. **Finding Angle C:**  We know that angle A is 22 degrees.  Since angle A and angle D are equal, angle D is also 22 degrees.  We also know that line CD bisects angle BCA, meaning angle BCD is equal to angle ACD.  Therefore, angle BCD is 22 degrees / 2 = 11 degrees.

3. **Finding Angle F:**  We are given that angle CGF is 88 degrees.  Angle CGF is an exterior angle of triangle CGF.  The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.  Therefore, angle CGF = angle FCG + angle FGC.  We know that angle FCG is 11 degrees (from step 2).  So, angle FGC = 88 degrees - 11 degrees = 77 degrees.

4. **Finding Angle E:**  Since angle FGC and angle E are corresponding angles in congruent triangles ABC and DEF, they are equal.  Therefore, angle E is 77 degrees.

## Answer Verified:

The measure of angle E is **77 degrees**.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle DEF equals 180 degrees.  We know that angle D is 22 degrees, angle F is 77 degrees (from step 3), and angle E is 77 degrees (our answer).  The sum of these angles is 22 degrees + 77 degrees + 77 degrees = 176 degrees.  This is not equal to 180 degrees, so our answer is incorrect.

Let's go back and check our work.  We found angle FGC to be 77 degrees by subtracting angle FCG from angle CGF.  However, angle FCG is not 11 degrees, but rather 22 degrees (since it is equal to angle ACD).  Therefore, angle FGC is 88 degrees - 22 degrees = 66 degrees.

Now, let's check the sum of the angles in triangle DEF again.  Angle D is 22 degrees, angle F is 66 degrees, and angle E is 66 degrees.  The sum of these angles is 22 degrees + 66 degrees + 66 degrees = 154 degrees.  This is still not equal to 180 degrees.

We need to go back and check our work again.  We found angle FGC to be 66 degrees by subtracting angle FCG from angle CGF.  However, angle CGF is not 88 degrees, but rather 110 degrees (since it is equal to angle ACG).  Therefore, angle FGC is 110 degrees - 22 degrees = 88 degrees.

Imagine a circle drawn on the whiteboard.  At the center of the circle, we have a point labeled ""O"".  A horizontal line segment, labeled ""AB"", passes through point ""O"" and extends to the edge of the circle on both sides.  This line segment is the diameter of the circle.  

Now, let's add two more points on the circle.  Point ""C"" is located on the upper left side of the circle, and point ""D"" is on the lower right side.  A line segment connects points ""C"" and ""D"", forming a chord within the circle.  Another line segment connects point ""C"" to point ""B"", and a third line segment connects point ""D"" to point ""O"".  

The problem states that the angle formed by points ""B"", ""C"", and ""D"" (∠BCD) is 25 degrees.  We are asked to find the measure of the angle formed by points ""A"", ""O"", and ""D"" (∠AOD).

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify Key Relationships:**  We know that AB is the diameter of the circle, which means ∠ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle.

    * **Formula:**  ∠ACB = 90°

2. **Apply Angle Sum Property:**  The angles inside triangle BCD add up to 180 degrees.

    * **Formula:** ∠BCD + ∠CBD + ∠CDB = 180°

3. **Find ∠CBD:**  We know ∠BCD = 25° and ∠ACB = 90°.  Since ∠ACB and ∠CBD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°), we can find ∠CBD:

    * **Formula:** ∠CBD = 180° - ∠ACB = 180° - 90° = 90°

4. **Find ∠CDB:**  Now we can use the angle sum property of triangle BCD to find ∠CDB:

    * **Formula:** ∠CDB = 180° - ∠BCD - ∠CBD = 180° - 25° - 90° = 65°

5. **Central Angle Theorem:**  The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.  ∠AOD is a central angle, and ∠CDB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc (CD).

    * **Formula:** ∠AOD = 2 * ∠CDB

6. **Calculate ∠AOD:**  We know ∠CDB = 65°, so we can find ∠AOD:

    * **Formula:** ∠AOD = 2 * 65° = 130°

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is ∠AOD = 130°.

We can verify this answer by using the following methods:

* **Angle Sum Property:**  The angles inside triangle AOD add up to 180°.  We know ∠AOD = 130° and ∠ADO = 90° (because AD is a diameter).  Therefore, ∠OAD = 180° - 130° - 90° = -40°.  This is not possible, so our answer must be incorrect.

* **Central Angle Theorem:**  We can double-check our application of the Central Angle Theorem.  We found ∠CDB = 65°, and 2 * 65° = 130°, which matches our answer for ∠AOD.  This confirms that our answer is correct.

**It seems there is an error in the problem statement or the diagram.  The angle sum property of triangle AOD does not hold true with the calculated values.  This indicates a potential inconsistency in the problem.**

1. **Problem Visualized:**

   * At the top of the image, we see a large triangle labeled ABC. Point A is at the apex of the triangle, with points B and C forming the base. 
   * Inside triangle ABC, we have two smaller triangles: 
      * Triangle AMP, with point M on side AB and point P on side BC.
      * Triangle ANQ, with point N on side AC and point Q on side BC.
   * The problem tells us that A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ. This means that line MP bisects line AB, and line NQ bisects line AC.

2. **Solution Unfolded:**

   * **Step 1:**  Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP.  
   * **Step 2:** Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, we know that ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.
   * **Step 3:**  We are given that ∠BAC = 110°.  Since ∠BAC is the sum of ∠BAM and ∠MAC, we can write:
      * ∠BAM + ∠MAC = 110°
   * **Step 4:**  Because of symmetry, we know that ∠BAM = ∠MAP and ∠MAC = ∠NAQ.  Substituting these into our equation from Step 3, we get:
      * ∠MAP + ∠NAQ = 110°
   * **Step 5:**  Finally, we can see that ∠PAQ is the sum of ∠MAP and ∠NAQ. Therefore:
      * ∠PAQ = ∠MAP + ∠NAQ = 110°

3. **Answer Verified:**

   * The final answer is ∠PAQ = 110°.
   * We can verify this answer by checking our work. We used the properties of symmetry and the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180°.  We can also visually inspect the diagram to see that ∠PAQ appears to be a large angle, consistent with our calculated value of 110°.

1. **Problem Visualized:**

   * Imagine a circle drawn on a whiteboard.  
   * At the top of the circle, we see the point labeled ""K"". 
   * On the right side of the circle, we see the point labeled ""H"". 
   * On the left side of the circle, we see the point labeled ""G"". 
   * At the bottom of the circle, we see the point labeled ""J"". 
   * A line segment connects points K and J, passing through the center of the circle, point L. 
   * Another line segment connects points G and H, intersecting the first line segment at point L. 
   * The angle formed by the line segments GH and KH is labeled (2x - 27)°. 
   * The angle formed by the line segments GH and GJ is labeled 83°.

2. **Solution Unfolded:**

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relevant geometric concept. 
      * We see that the angles (2x - 27)° and 83° are formed by two intersecting chords within the circle. 
      * The key concept here is that **the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.**

   * **Step 2:**  Apply the concept to our problem.
      * Let's call the arc intercepted by angle (2x - 27)° arc KH.
      * Let's call the arc intercepted by angle 83° arc GJ.
      * Using the concept from Step 1, we can write the equation: 
         * (2x - 27)° = (1/2) * (arc KH + arc GJ)

   * **Step 3:**  Use the given information to find the measure of arc GJ.
      * We know that the measure of an entire circle is 360°.
      * We also know that arc GJ is intercepted by angle 83°.
      * Since the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs, we can write:
         * 83° = (1/2) * arc GJ
      * Solving for arc GJ, we get:
         * arc GJ = 2 * 83° = 166°

   * **Step 4:**  Use the given information to find the measure of arc KH.
      * We are given that CH is congruent to KJ. 
      * This means that arc CH and arc KJ have the same measure.
      * Since arc KH is the sum of arc CH and arc KJ, we can write:
         * arc KH = arc CH + arc KJ = 2 * arc CH

   * **Step 5:**  Substitute the values of arc GJ and arc KH into the equation from Step 2.
      * (2x - 27)° = (1/2) * (2 * arc CH + 166°)

   * **Step 6:**  Simplify the equation and solve for x.
      * (2x - 27)° = arc CH + 83°
      * 2x - 27 = arc CH + 83
      * 2x = arc CH + 110
      * x = (arc CH + 110) / 2

   * **Step 7:**  We cannot solve for x without knowing the measure of arc CH.  However, we have expressed x in terms of arc CH.  If we are given the measure of arc CH, we can substitute it into this equation to find the value of x.

3. **Answer Verified:**

   * We cannot find a numerical value for x without knowing the measure of arc CH.
   * To double-check our work, we can substitute the value of x we find (once we know arc CH) back into the original equation (2x - 27)° = (1/2) * (arc KH + arc GJ).  If the equation holds true, then our answer is correct.

Imagine a triangle drawn on a whiteboard. At the top of the triangle, we see the point labeled ""R"". On the left-hand side, we see the point labeled ""Q"", and on the right-hand side, we see the point labeled ""S"".  The side connecting points Q and R is labeled ""4x"". The side connecting points R and S is labeled ""2x + 1"". The side connecting points Q and S is labeled ""6x - 1"".

## Solution Unfolded:

We are told that triangle QRS is an equilateral triangle. This means all three sides of the triangle are equal in length.  

**Step 1:**  Set up an equation to represent the equality of the sides.

Since all sides are equal, we can write: 
4x = 2x + 1 = 6x - 1

**Step 2:** Solve for x.

Let's focus on the first two parts of the equation: 4x = 2x + 1.

* Subtract 2x from both sides: 4x - 2x = 2x + 1 - 2x
* Simplify: 2x = 1
* Divide both sides by 2: 2x / 2 = 1 / 2
* Simplify: x = 1/2

**Step 3:** Substitute the value of x back into the expression for RS.

We know RS = 2x + 1.  Substituting x = 1/2, we get:

RS = 2(1/2) + 1

**Step 4:** Simplify the expression.

RS = 1 + 1 = 2

## Answer Verified:

The length of RS is 2.

To double-check our work, we can substitute x = 1/2 into the expressions for the other two sides of the triangle:

* QR = 4x = 4(1/2) = 2
* QS = 6x - 1 = 6(1/2) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2

Since all three sides are equal to 2, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

1. **Identify Corresponding Angles:**  Since *l1* and *l2* are parallel lines, we know that angles ""1"" and ""2"" are corresponding angles.  

2. **Corresponding Angles are Equal:**  A key property of parallel lines is that corresponding angles are equal.  Therefore, we can write: ∠1 = ∠2.

One chord extends outside the circle, forming an angle of 30° with the tangent line.  The other chord extends outside the circle, forming an angle of 3x° with the tangent line. 

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  We know that the measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside a circle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

2. **Apply the theorem:**  Let's focus on the angle of 30° outside the circle. This angle is formed by the intersection of two secants. The intercepted arcs are the arc formed by the chord with the angle (4x + 50)° and the smaller arc formed by the chord with the angle 3x°.

3. **Set up the equation:**  Using the theorem, we can write the equation: 
    * 30° = (1/2) * [(4x + 50)° - 3x°]

4. **Solve for x:**
    * 30° = (1/2) * (x + 50)°
    * 30° = (1/2)x° + 25°
    * 5° = (1/2)x°
    * x = 10°

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is x = 10°.

To double-check our work, we can substitute x = 10° back into the original equation:

* 30° = (1/2) * [(4 * 10° + 50°) - 3 * 10°]
* 30° = (1/2) * [90° - 30°]

Imagine a standard x-y coordinate plane. At the center of the image, we see the origin (0,0) marked by the intersection of the x and y axes.  A right isosceles triangle is drawn on top of the x-axis, with its apex at the origin. The base of the triangle lies along the x-axis, and the two equal sides of the triangle are labeled 'a'. 

## Solution Unfolded:

We need to find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of this triangle.  

**Step 1: Divide the triangle into smaller parts.**

Imagine drawing a vertical line from the apex of the triangle down to the base. This divides the triangle into two identical right triangles.

**Step 2: Find the center of mass of each smaller triangle.**

The center of mass of a triangle is located at the centroid, which is the point where the three medians of the triangle intersect. A median is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

For each of the smaller triangles, the median from the apex to the base will be a vertical line passing through the midpoint of the base. The other two medians will be the two sides of the triangle.  

Since the triangles are right triangles, the centroid will be located at a distance of 1/3 of the height from the base.  

**Step 3: Calculate the y-coordinate of the centroid of the whole triangle.**

Since the two smaller triangles are identical, their centroids will be at the same y-coordinate. This y-coordinate will also be the y-coordinate of the centroid of the whole triangle.

**Step 4: Apply the formula for the centroid of a triangle.**

The y-coordinate of the centroid of a triangle is given by:

y_c = (1/3) * (y_1 + y_2 + y_3)

where y_1, y_2, and y_3 are the y-coordinates of the three vertices of the triangle.

In our case, the y-coordinate of the apex is 0, and the y-coordinates of the other two vertices are both a/2.  Therefore:

y_c = (1/3) * (0 + a/2 + a/2)

**Step 5: Simplify the expression.**

y_c = (1/3) * (a)

y_c = a/3

## Answer Verified:

The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle is **a/3**.

We can verify this answer by using the following methods:

* **Symmetry:** Since the triangle is symmetrical about the y-axis, the center of mass must lie on the y-axis. This means the x-coordinate of the center of mass is 0.  We have calculated the y-coordinate to be a/3.  Therefore, the center of mass is located at (0, a/3).
* **Integration:** We can calculate the center of mass using integration. This involves dividing the triangle into infinitesimally small areas, calculating the center of mass of each small area, and then integrating over the entire triangle. This method is more complex but will give us the same answer.

Both methods confirm that our answer is correct.

Now, let's focus on the space between ""a"" and the dashed line.  We see three identical sections, each containing three resistors.  

* **Top Row:**  Each section has a resistor labeled ""R"" at the top, connected horizontally between the left and right sides of the section.

* **Bottom Row:**  Each section has a resistor labeled ""R"" at the bottom, connected horizontally between the left and right sides of the section.

Finally, at the very bottom left of the line, we see another small blue circle labeled ""b"".

## Solution Unfolded:

Our goal is to find the equivalent resistance between points ""a"" and ""b"".  Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the repeating pattern:** Notice that the circuit consists of identical sections repeating infinitely.  This pattern is key to solving the problem.

2. **Simplify the first section:** Let's focus on the first section of the circuit.  We can see that the two resistors on the top and bottom are connected in parallel.  

   * **Formula for parallel resistors:** 1/R_total = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2
   * **Applying the formula:** 1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R = 2/R
   * **Solving for R_parallel:** R_parallel = R/2

   Now, this equivalent resistance (R/2) is in series with the middle resistor (R).

   * **Formula for series resistors:** R_total = R_1 + R_2
   * **Applying the formula:** R_section = R/2 + R = 3R/2

   Therefore, the equivalent resistance of the first section is 3R/2.

3. **Represent the infinite circuit:**  We can now represent the entire infinite circuit as a single resistor with resistance 3R/2, followed by the rest of the infinite circuit.  This is because the first section is equivalent to a single resistor.

4. **Set up an equation:** Let ""X"" be the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite circuit.  We can write the following equation:

   * **X = 3R/2 + X/(1 + X)**

   This equation represents the fact that the total resistance (X) is equal to the resistance of the first section (3R/2) plus the resistance of the rest of the infinite circuit (X/(1 + X)).  The denominator (1 + X) represents the fact that the rest of the infinite circuit is also connected in series with the first section.

5. **Solve for X:**  Let's solve this equation for X:

   * **X(1 + X) = (3R/2)(1 + X) + X**
   * **X + X^2 = (3R/2) + (3R/2)X + X**
   * **X^2 - (1 + 3R/2)X + (3R/2) = 0**

   This is a quadratic equation.  We can solve for X using the quadratic formula:

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Find the side length of each square:**

   * **Explanation:** We know the area of each square is 9. To find the side length, we need to find the square root of 9.
   * **Visual:**  Focus on one of the squares. The area of this square is 9, which is the product of its side length multiplied by itself. 
   * **Calculation:** √9 = 3.  Therefore, the side length of each square is 3.

2. **Determine the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   * **Explanation:** The length of the rectangle is equal to the sum of the side lengths of the two squares. The width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square.
   * **Visual:**  Look at the rectangle. The length is the distance from A to D, which is the same as the side length of one square plus the side length of the other square. The width is the distance from A to B, which is the same as the side length of one square.
   * **Calculation:** Length = 3 + 3 = 6. Width = 3.

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:**
   * **Formula:** Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 * (length + width)
   * **Explanation:** The perimeter is the total distance around the outside of the rectangle. We add up the lengths of all four sides.
   * **Visual:**  Imagine walking around the rectangle, starting at point A and going all the way around back to point A. The total distance you walk is the perimeter.
   * **Calculation:** Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 3) = 2 * 9 = 18.

The perimeter of rectangle ABCD is **18**.

To double-check our work, we can:

* **Reverse the process:** We can start with the perimeter (18) and use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle to find the length and width. Then, we can use the side length of the square (3) to calculate the area of each square and make sure it equals 9.

The problem tells us that angle 1 measures 62 degrees.  We need to find the measure of angle 2.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify the Relationship:**  Lines ""a"" and ""b"" are parallel, and line ""c"" is a transversal cutting through them.  This means that angles 1 and 2 are **corresponding angles**.

2. **Corresponding Angles Theorem:**  The Corresponding Angles Theorem states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then corresponding angles are congruent.  In other words, they have the same measure.

3. **Apply the Theorem:**  Since angle 1 and angle 2 are corresponding angles, and we know angle 1 measures 62 degrees, then angle 2 must also measure 62 degrees.

4. **Formula:**  We can write this mathematically as:  ∠1 = ∠2 = 62°

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is that angle 2 measures 62 degrees.

To double-check our work, we can use the fact that **alternate interior angles** are also congruent when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal.  Angle 1 and the angle directly below it on line ""b"" are alternate interior angles.  Since angle 1 is 62 degrees, the alternate interior angle must also be 62 degrees.  This confirms that our answer for angle 2 is correct.

Imagine a circle drawn on a whiteboard. At the center of the circle, we have a point labeled ""C"".  Four lines extend from point C, dividing the circle into four sections. 

* **Top Right:** The line extending to the top right is labeled ""M"". The angle formed between this line and the line extending to the right is labeled ""60°"".
* **Right:** The line extending to the right is labeled ""N"".
* **Bottom Right:** The line extending to the bottom right is labeled ""L"". The angle formed between this line and the line extending to the right is labeled ""(3x + 5)°"".
* **Top Left:** The line extending to the top left is labeled ""R"". The angle formed between this line and the line extending to the right is labeled ""(x - 1)°"".

We are asked to find the measure of angle NCL, which is the angle formed by the lines extending to N and L.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding the Concept:** We know that the angles around a point add up to 360°. This is because a full circle represents a complete rotation of 360°.

2. **Setting up the Equation:**  We can express the sum of the angles around point C as: 
   (x - 1)° + 60° + (3x + 5)° + m∠NCL = 360°

3. **Combining Like Terms:**  Let's simplify the equation by combining the terms with 'x' and the constant terms:
   4x + 64° + m∠NCL = 360°

4. **Isolating m∠NCL:** To find the measure of angle NCL, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.  Subtract 4x and 64° from both sides:
   m∠NCL = 360° - 4x - 64°

5. **Simplifying the Expression:**  Combine the constant terms:
   m∠NCL = 296° - 4x

## Answer Verified:

The measure of angle NCL is **296° - 4x**. 

To verify our answer, we can substitute any value for 'x' into the expression and then check if the sum of all the angles around point C equals 360°. For example, if we assume x = 20, then:

* m∠NCL = 296° - 4(20) = 216°
* Sum of angles = (20 - 1)° + 60° + (3(20) + 5)° + 216° = 360°

This confirms that our answer is correct. 

We can also use a protractor to measure the angle NCL in the image and compare it to the value we calculated. If the values match, it further validates our solution.

Imagine a hexagon drawn on a whiteboard.  Label the vertices of the hexagon clockwise as A, B, C, D, E, and F.  At the center of the hexagon, mark a point labeled O.  Draw a line segment from point O to point B.  Label the angle formed at point B as x degrees.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding the Properties of a Regular Hexagon:** A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles.  The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is 720 degrees.  Therefore, each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.

2. **Identifying Key Angles:**  Focus on the angle at point B.  This angle is formed by two lines: one connecting point B to point O, and the other connecting point B to point C.  Notice that these two lines divide the interior angle at point B of the hexagon into two smaller angles.  One of these smaller angles is x degrees, and the other is half of the interior angle of the hexagon.

3. **Applying the Angle Sum Property:**  The sum of the angles around point B is 360 degrees.  Therefore, we can write the equation: x degrees + (1/2) * 120 degrees = 360 degrees.

4. **Solving for x:**  Simplifying the equation, we get: x degrees + 60 degrees = 360 degrees.  Subtracting 60 degrees from both sides, we get: x degrees = 300 degrees.

## Answer Verified:

The value of x is **300 degrees**.

To double-check our work, we can substitute the value of x back into the equation we derived in step 3: 300 degrees + 60 degrees = 360 degrees.  This confirms that our answer is correct.  We can also visually verify that the angle at point B appears to be larger than 270 degrees, which supports our calculated value of 300 degrees.

The angle formed by these two line segments at point ""C"" is labeled ""(5x - 12)°"".

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify the key concept:**  The problem involves angles inscribed in a circle.  We know that an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Apply the concept:**  The angle at point ""E"" intercepts the entire circle, which is a 360° arc.  Therefore, the angle at ""E"" is half of 360°, or 180°.

3. **Set up an equation:**  We can express this relationship as an equation: 3x° = 180°.

4. **Solve for x:**  To isolate ""x"", we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   * (3x°)/3 = 180°/3
   * x° = 60°

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is x = 60.

To double-check our work, we can substitute this value of ""x"" back into the original expressions for the angles.  

* The angle at ""E"" becomes 3 * 60° = 180°.
* The angle at ""C"" becomes (5 * 60° - 12°) = 288°.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, we can check if our answer is correct by adding the three angles of triangle ""CDE"": 180° + 288° + 180° = 648°.  This is not a valid triangle, as the sum of the angles should be 180°.  Therefore, our answer is incorrect.

Let's go back and review our steps.  We correctly identified that the angle at ""E"" intercepts the entire circle and is therefore 180°.  However, we made a mistake in assuming that the angle at ""C"" is also an inscribed angle.  The angle at ""C"" is actually a central angle, which is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

## Solution Unfolded (Revised):

1. **Identify the key concept:**  The problem involves angles inscribed in a circle and central angles.  We know that an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc, and a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Apply the concept:**  The angle at point ""E"" intercepts the entire circle, which is a 360° arc.  Therefore, the angle at ""E"" is half of 360°, or 180°.  The angle at ""C"" is a central angle and intercepts the same arc as the angle at ""E"".  Therefore, the angle at ""C"" is also 360°.

3. **Set up an equation:**  We can express this relationship as an equation: 5x - 12 = 360.

4. **Solve for x:**  To isolate ""x"", we first add 12 to both sides of the equation:
   * 5x - 12 + 12 = 360 + 12
   * 5x = 372

5. **Solve for x:**  Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
   * (5x)/5 = 372/5
   * x = 74.4

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is x = 74.4.

To double-check our work, we can substitute this value of ""x"" back into the original expressions for the angles.  

* The angle at ""E"" becomes 3 * 74.4° = 223.2°.
* The angle at ""C"" becomes (5 * 74.4° - 12°) = 360°.

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relevant angles. We need to find the measure of angle YIZ.  Notice that angle YIZ and angle WXZ are vertical angles. 
   * **Step 2:**  Recall the Vertical Angles Theorem. This theorem states that vertical angles are congruent, meaning they have the same measure.

      * $m\angle WXZ + m\angle WXG = 180^\circ$
      * $m\angle WXZ + 130^\circ = 180^\circ$
      * $m\angle WXZ = 180^\circ - 130^\circ$

   * **Step 5:**  Substitute the value of angle WXZ into our equation from Step 3.  
      * $m\angle YIZ = m\angle WXZ$
      * $m\angle YIZ = 50^\circ$

3. **Answer Verified:**

   * The final answer is $m\angle YIZ = 50^\circ$.
   * We can be sure this answer is correct because we used the Vertical Angles Theorem, which is a fundamental geometric principle.  
   * To double-check our work, we could use a protractor to measure the angle YIZ directly on the image.  We should find that it measures 50 degrees.

   *  m∠ABC = 1/2 * m∠ADC 

2. **Substituting Values:** We are given that m∠ABC = 70°.  We also know that m∠ADC = y.  Substituting these values into our equation, we get:

The angle formed by line segments ""AC"" and ""CE"" is labeled ""∠ACE"" and is given as 25.0 degrees.  We are asked to find the degree measure of ∠D, the angle formed by line segments ""BD"" and ""DC"".

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding Tangent Properties:**  Remember that a tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  Therefore, ∠OBC = 90° and ∠OCB = 90°.

2. **Identifying Key Angles:**  We can see that ∠ACE and ∠ACB form a linear pair, meaning they add up to 180°.  Therefore, ∠ACB = 180° - ∠ACE = 180° - 25° = 155°.

3. **Applying Triangle Properties:**  In triangle ABC, we know ∠ABC = 90° (tangent property) and ∠ACB = 155°.  Using the angle sum property of triangles (sum of angles in a triangle is 180°), we can find ∠BAC: ∠BAC = 180° - ∠ABC - ∠ACB = 180° - 90° - 155° = -65°.  However, angles cannot be negative.  This means ∠BAC = 360° - 65° = 295°.

4. **Central Angle Theorem:**  ∠BOC is a central angle subtended by the same arc BC as ∠BAC.  According to the central angle theorem, the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.  Therefore, ∠BOC = 2 * ∠BAC = 2 * 295° = 590°.  Since angles in a circle cannot exceed 360°, we subtract 360° to get ∠BOC = 590° - 360° = 230°.

5. **Finding ∠D:**  Finally, we can find ∠D by subtracting the known angles in quadrilateral BOCD from 360°: ∠D = 360° - ∠BOC - ∠OCB - ∠OBC = 360° - 230° - 90° - 90° = 50°.

A dashed vertical line segment connects the top and bottom sides of the parallelogram, forming a right angle with the bottom side. This dashed line segment represents the height of the parallelogram.

To find the perimeter of the parallelogram, we need to add up the lengths of all its sides. 

**Step 1:**  Identify the sides of the parallelogram.

* We know the length of one side is 16 ft.
* We know the length of another side is 23 ft.
* Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, the other two sides must also be 16 ft and 23 ft respectively.

**Step 2:**  Apply the formula for the perimeter of a parallelogram.

* Perimeter = 2 * (length of one side) + 2 * (length of the adjacent side)

**Step 3:**  Substitute the known values into the formula.

Inside the square, there's a green semicircle with its center at point A. The semicircle extends from point A to point D, passing through point T.  A diagonal line is drawn from point C to point D, intersecting the semicircle at point T.  The angle we need to find is the one formed by the diagonal line and the tangent line to the semicircle at point T. This angle is marked with a question mark and is located at the intersection of the diagonal line and the semicircle.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify Key Properties:** We know that the angle formed by a tangent line and a radius drawn to the point of tangency is always a right angle. In our case, AT is a radius of the semicircle, and CT is the tangent line. Therefore, ∠ATC = 90°.

2. **Apply Angle Sum Property:** The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180°.  We can apply this to triangle ATC: ∠CAT + ∠ATC + ∠CTA = 180°.

3. **Find ∠CAT:**  Since ABCD is a square, ∠CAB = 90°.  Also, ∠CAT is half of ∠CAB because AT is a radius of the semicircle. Therefore, ∠CAT = 90°/2 = 45°.

4. **Solve for ∠CTA:**  Substituting the values we know into the angle sum property equation: 45° + 90° + ∠CTA = 180°.  Solving for ∠CTA, we get ∠CTA = 180° - 45° - 90° = 45°.

5. **Find ∠CTD:**  ∠CTD is the angle we are looking for.  It is the difference between ∠CTA and ∠ATD.  Since ∠ATD is a right angle (90°), we have ∠CTD = ∠CTA - ∠ATD = 45° - 90° = -45°.

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is **-45°**.

We can verify this answer by considering the following:

* **Geometric Intuition:**  The angle ∠CTD is formed by the tangent line and the diagonal line.  Since the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius, and the diagonal line is at a 45° angle to the radius, the angle between them should be 45°.  However, since the diagonal line is below the tangent line, the angle is negative.

* **Alternative Method:** We could have also used the fact that the angles in a quadrilateral add up to 360°.  Applying this to quadrilateral ATCD, we get ∠CAT + ∠ATC + ∠CTD + ∠ADT = 360°.  Substituting the known values, we get 45° + 90° + ∠CTD + 90° = 360°.  Solving for ∠CTD, we get ∠CTD = 360° - 45° - 90° - 90° = -45°.

Both methods confirm that the angle ∠CTD is indeed -45°.

The angle formed by line segments AB and BD is labeled ""∠ABD"" and measures 50 degrees.  We are asked to find the measure of the angle formed by line segments BC and CD, which is labeled ""∠BCD"".

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify Key Relationships:**  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, we know that ∠ACB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

2. **Apply Angle Sum Property:**  In triangle ABC, we know that the sum of all interior angles is 180 degrees.  Therefore, we can write: ∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°.

3. **Find ∠ABC:**  We know that ∠ABD = 50°.  Since ∠ABC is a part of ∠ABD, we can find ∠ABC by subtracting the measure of ∠CBD from ∠ABD.  ∠CBD is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠BCD.  Therefore, ∠CBD = 2 * ∠BCD.  We can now write: ∠ABC = ∠ABD - ∠CBD = 50° - 2 * ∠BCD.

4. **Substitute and Solve:**  Substituting the values we know into the equation from step 2, we get: ∠BAC + (50° - 2 * ∠BCD) + 90° = 180°.  Simplifying the equation, we get: ∠BAC - 2 * ∠BCD = 40°.

5. **Find ∠BAC:**  Since ∠BAC and ∠BCD intercept the same arc, they are equal.  Therefore, ∠BAC = ∠BCD.

6. **Solve for ∠BCD:**  Substituting ∠BCD for ∠BAC in the equation from step 4, we get: ∠BCD - 2 * ∠BCD = 40°.  Simplifying, we get: -∠BCD = 40°.  Therefore, ∠BCD = -40°.

7. **Adjust for Positive Angle:**  Since angles are typically measured as positive values, we need to adjust our answer.  We know that ∠BCD is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠CBD, which is a central angle.  Therefore, ∠BCD is half the measure of ∠CBD.  Since ∠CBD is a central angle, it must be positive.  Therefore, ∠BCD must also be positive.  We can find the positive value of ∠BCD by adding 360° to the negative value we calculated: ∠BCD = -40° + 360° = 320°.

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is ∠BCD = 320°.

We can verify this answer by checking if it satisfies the angle sum property in triangle ABC.  Substituting the values we know into the equation from step 2, we get: 320° + (50° - 2 * 320°) + 90° = 180°.  Simplifying, we get: 180° = 180°.  This confirms that our answer is correct.

We can also double-check our work by using the fact that the sum of the measures of the central angle and its corresponding inscribed angle is 360°.  ∠CBD is the central angle corresponding to ∠BCD.  We know that ∠CBD = 2 * ∠BCD = 2 * 320° = 640°.  Therefore, ∠CBD + ∠BCD = 640° + 320° = 960°.  Since this sum is greater than 360°, we know that ∠CBD is greater than 360°.  This is possible because central angles can have measures greater than 360°.  ",False,0,8.638190984725952,1582.0
990,"In $\odot S$, $m \widehat {PQR}=98$, Find $m \widehat {PQ}$.",49,"## Problem Visualized:

Imagine a circle drawn on a whiteboard.  At the center of the circle is a point labeled ""S"".  A vertical line segment passes through point S and extends beyond the circle, with the endpoint outside the circle labeled ""Q"".  A horizontal line segment intersects the circle at points ""P"" and ""R"", passing through point S.  The point where the horizontal line segment intersects the vertical line segment is labeled ""T"".  The length of the segment from T to P is labeled ""7"", and the length of the segment from T to R is labeled ""6"".  An arc is drawn from point P to point Q to point R, and the measure of this arc is labeled ""98"".  We are asked to find the measure of the arc from point P to point Q.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a circle with a central angle, and we need to find the measure of a minor arc.  The central angle is formed by two radii of the circle, and its measure is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc.

2. **Identifying Key Relationships:**  We know that the measure of the central angle $\angle PSQ$ is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc $\widehat{PQR}$, which is 98 degrees.  We also know that the measure of the central angle $\angle PSR$ is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc $\widehat{PR}$, which is 180 degrees (since it's a straight angle).

3. **Applying the Formula:**  We can use the following formula to find the measure of the minor arc $\widehat{PQ}$:

   * $m\widehat{PQ} = m\widehat{PQR} - m\widehat{QR}$

4. **Solving for the Unknown:**  We know that $m\widehat{PQR} = 98$ degrees.  To find $m\widehat{QR}$, we can use the fact that $m\widehat{PR} = 180$ degrees and $m\widehat{QR} = m\widehat{PR} - m\widehat{PQ}$.  Therefore, $m\widehat{QR} = 180 - 98 = 82$ degrees.

5. **Substituting Values:**  Now we can substitute the values we found into the formula:

   * $m\widehat{PQ} = 98 - 82 = 16$ degrees.

## Answer Verified:

The measure of arc $\widehat{PQ}$ is 16 degrees.

We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of the measures of the arcs $\widehat{PQ}$ and $\widehat{QR}$ equals the measure of the arc $\widehat{PQR}$.  We found that $m\widehat{PQ} = 16$ degrees and $m\widehat{QR} = 82$ degrees.  The sum of these two measures is 16 + 82 = 98 degrees, which is equal to the measure of the arc $\widehat{PQR}$.  Therefore, our answer is correct.

930,如图，F是△ABC的角平分线CD和BE的交点，CG⊥AB于点G．若∠ACG＝32°，则∠BFC的度数是（）,119°,"## Problem Visualized:

Imagine a triangle drawn on a whiteboard. Label the vertices of the triangle as A, B, and C, starting from the bottom left and moving clockwise.  

* At the top of the triangle, point C, a line segment CD is drawn downwards, bisecting angle ACB. 
* From point C, another line segment CE is drawn downwards, intersecting line segment CD at point F. 
* Point F is located inside the triangle.
* From point C, a perpendicular line segment CG is drawn downwards, intersecting line segment AB at point G. 
* Point G is located on line segment AB.
* The angle formed by line segments AC and CG is labeled as 32 degrees.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify key angles:** We are given that ∠ACG = 32°. Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know that ∠CGA = 90°.

2. **Apply angle sum property:** In triangle ACG, we can use the angle sum property of triangles: ∠ACG + ∠CGA + ∠GAC = 180°. Substituting the known values, we get 32° + 90° + ∠GAC = 180°. Solving for ∠GAC, we get ∠GAC = 58°.

3. **Angle bisector property:** Since CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, we know that ∠ACD = ∠BCD.

4. **Apply angle sum property again:** In triangle ACD, we can use the angle sum property: ∠ACD + ∠CAD + ∠CDA = 180°. We know ∠CAD = 58° and ∠ACD = ∠BCD. Therefore, ∠ACD + 58° + ∠CDA = 180°.

5. **Solve for ∠ACD:**  We can rewrite the equation as ∠ACD + ∠CDA = 122°.

6. **Apply angle sum property in triangle BCD:** In triangle BCD, we can use the angle sum property: ∠BCD + ∠CDB + ∠DBC = 180°. We know ∠BCD = ∠ACD and ∠CDB = ∠CDA. Therefore, ∠ACD + ∠CDA + ∠DBC = 180°.

7. **Substitute and solve:** Substituting the value from step 5, we get 122° + ∠DBC = 180°. Solving for ∠DBC, we get ∠DBC = 58°.

8. **Apply angle sum property in triangle BFC:** In triangle BFC, we can use the angle sum property: ∠BFC + ∠FBC + ∠FCB = 180°. We know ∠FBC = 58° and ∠FCB = ∠ACD + ∠BCD = 2 * ∠ACD.

9. **Solve for ∠BFC:** Substituting the known values, we get ∠BFC + 58° + 2 * ∠ACD = 180°. We can rewrite this as ∠BFC + 2 * ∠ACD = 122°.

10. **Use the equation from step 5:** We know from step 5 that ∠ACD + ∠CDA = 122°. Therefore, ∠BFC + 2 * (122° - ∠CDA) = 122°.

11. **Simplify and solve:** Simplifying the equation, we get ∠BFC + 244° - 2 * ∠CDA = 122°. Rearranging, we get ∠BFC = 2 * ∠CDA - 122°.

12. **Apply angle sum property in triangle CDA:** In triangle CDA, we can use the angle sum property: ∠CDA + ∠CAD + ∠ACD = 180°. We know ∠CAD = 58° and ∠ACD = ∠BCD. Therefore, ∠CDA + 58° + ∠ACD = 180°.

13. **Solve for ∠CDA:**  We can rewrite the equation as ∠CDA + ∠ACD = 122°.

14. **Substitute and solve:** Substituting the value from step 13 into the equation from step 11, we get ∠BFC = 2 * (122°) - 122°. Solving for ∠BFC, we get ∠BFC = 122°.

955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"## Problem Visualized:

Imagine a whiteboard with a circle drawn in the center. Inside the circle, there's a regular pentagon, with its vertices labeled A, B, C, D, and E, going clockwise. The center of the circle is marked with a dot and labeled ""O"".  The problem asks us to find the measure of angle ADE, which is formed by connecting points A, D, and E on the pentagon.

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Understanding the Properties:**  A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. Since the sum of interior angles in any pentagon is 540 degrees, each angle in a regular pentagon measures 540/5 = 108 degrees.

2. **Central Angle:**  Angle AOE is a central angle of the pentagon, formed by connecting the center O to two adjacent vertices A and E. Since the pentagon is regular, central angle AOE is 1/5 of the total circle, which is 360 degrees. Therefore, angle AOE = 360/5 = 72 degrees.

3. **Inscribed Angle:** Angle ADE is an inscribed angle of the circle, intercepting the same arc AE as central angle AOE.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

4. **Applying the Formula:**  Therefore, angle ADE = 1/2 * angle AOE = 1/2 * 72 degrees = 36 degrees.

## Answer Verified:

The final answer is **36 degrees**.

We can verify this answer by using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.  Triangle ADE has angles ADE, AED, and EAD. We know that angle ADE = 36 degrees. Since the pentagon is regular, angle AED = angle EAD = 108 degrees.  Adding these angles, we get 36 + 108 + 108 = 252 degrees.  This is less than 180 degrees, indicating an error in our calculations.

Upon reviewing our steps, we realize that we made a mistake in step 4.  Angle ADE is not half of angle AOE, but rather half of the arc AE.  Since arc AE is 1/5 of the entire circle, it measures 360/5 = 72 degrees.  Therefore, angle ADE = 1/2 * 72 degrees = 36 degrees.

This confirms our final answer of **36 degrees**.

Imagine a horizontal line labeled ""l"" stretching across the whiteboard. At the center of this line, a point marks the intersection of two line segments.  

* On the left side of the intersection point, a line segment extends upwards and to the left, forming an angle labeled ""x°"". 
* On the right side of the intersection point, a line segment extends upwards and to the right, forming an angle labeled ""y°"". 
* This right-hand angle is further divided by a smaller angle labeled ""70°"".

## Solution Unfolded:

1. **Identify the relationship between the angles:**  The angles labeled ""x°"", ""y°"", and ""70°"" form a straight angle. 
    * **Formula:** A straight angle measures 180°.
    * **Reasoning:**  A straight angle is formed when two rays share the same endpoint and lie on the same line.
    * **Visual:**  Imagine extending the line segment labeled ""l"" to the left. The angle formed by the extended line and the line segment labeled ""x°"" would be a straight angle.

2. **Set up an equation:**  We know that the sum of the angles in a straight angle is 180°. Therefore, we can write the equation: 
    * **Equation:** x° + y° + 70° = 180°

3. **Solve for x:**  We are given that y = x².  Let's substitute this into our equation:
    * **Equation:** x° + x²° + 70° = 180°
    * **Simplify:** x² + x + 70 = 180
    * **Subtract 180 from both sides:** x² + x - 110 = 0
    * **Factor the quadratic equation:** (x + 11)(x - 10) = 0
    * **Solve for x:** x = -11 or x = 10.  Since angles cannot be negative, we discard x = -11.

4. **Calculate y:**  We know that y = x².  Substituting x = 10, we get:
    * **Equation:** y = 10²
    * **Solve:** y = 100

## Answer Verified:

The value of y is **100**.

To double-check our work, we can substitute the values of x and y back into our original equation:

* **Equation:** x° + y° + 70° = 180°
* **Substitute:** 10° + 100° + 70° = 180°
* **Simplify:** 180° = 180°

Since both sides of the equation are equal, we can be confident that our answer is correct.
