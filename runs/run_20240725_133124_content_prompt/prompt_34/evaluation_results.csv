643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand the Properties**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Parallel Lines:** When parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.

**2. Apply the Properties**

* **Angle D:** Since CD is a diameter, ∠D intercepts a semicircle. Therefore, ∠D is a right angle, and its measure is 90°.
* **Angle AOD:**  ∠D and ∠AOD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°). So, ∠AOD = 180° - 90° = 90°.
* **Angle AOE:** Since DE || OA, ∠AOE and ∠D are corresponding angles. Therefore, ∠AOE = ∠D = 50°.
* **Arc AE:**  ∠AOE is a central angle intercepting arc AE. So, arc AE = ∠AOE = 50°.
* **Angle C:** ∠C is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AE. Therefore, ∠C = (1/2) * arc AE = (1/2) * 50° = 25°.

**3. Answer**

The degree of ∠C is **25°.**

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"We can use the sine function to solve for $h$.  The sine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the length of the side opposite the angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse.  In this case, we have:

$$\sin 60^\circ = \frac{4}{h}$$

We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so we can substitute that in:

$$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{4}{h}$$

To solve for $h$, we can cross-multiply:

$$\sqrt{3} \cdot h = 2 \cdot 4$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\sqrt{3} \cdot h = 8$$

Finally, we can divide both sides by $\sqrt{3}$ to isolate $h$:

$$h = \frac{8}{\sqrt{3}}$$

We are given that ∠AOD = 70°. We need to find ∠AOE.

**Step 2: Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180°.**

∠AOD and ∠DOB are angles on a straight line, so:
∠AOD + ∠DOB = 180°
70° + ∠DOB = 180°
∠DOB = 180° - 70° = 110°

**Step 3: Use the fact that angles at a point add up to 360°.**

∠DOB and ∠BOC are angles at a point, so:
∠DOB + ∠BOC = 360°
110° + ∠BOC = 360°
∠BOC = 360° - 110° = 250°

**Step 4: Use the fact that OE bisects ∠BOC.**

Since OE bisects ∠BOC, we have:
∠BOE = ∠COE = ∠BOC / 2 = 250° / 2 = 125°

**Step 5: Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180°.**

∠AOE and ∠BOE are angles on a straight line, so:
∠AOE + ∠BOE = 180°

The force due to particle 1 is attractive and points in the negative x direction. The force due to particle 2 is repulsive and points in the positive x direction. The force due to particle 4 is attractive and points in the negative x direction.

The magnitude of the force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law:

The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In this case, $JK$ is the hypotenuse, so we have:

Taking the square root of both sides:

$JL = \sqrt{115}$

Now, we can use the sine function to find the measure of $∠J$. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the length of the side opposite the angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse.

∠BDC = 90°

Therefore, in triangle BCD, we can find angle ACB:

We are given a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of AB that intersects AB at point D and BC at point E. We are also given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13. We need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

**Step 2: Use the properties of perpendicular bisectors**

Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 3.

**Step 3: Use the perimeter information**

The perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, which means:

AC + CE + AE = 13

**Step 4: Find the missing side lengths**

Since AD = DB = 3, we can find AC by using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ADC:

AC² = AD² + DC² = 3² + DC²

Simplifying the equation:

DC² + CE + DE² = 4

**Step 6: Find the perimeter of triangle ABC**

The perimeter of triangle ABC is:

AB + BC + AC = 6 + BC + √(3² + DC²)

Since BC = CE + BE, we can substitute it in the above equation:

**Step 2: Use the angle bisector theorem**

The angle bisector theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides.

* In triangle ABC, BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC. Therefore, AE/EC = AB/BC.
* In triangle BCD, CF is the angle bisector of angle BCD. Therefore, DF/FB = DC/BC.

* AE/EC = 3/4

Since AE + EC = AD = 4 and DF + FB = AD = 4, we can solve for AE, EC, DF, and FB:

   The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In this case, we have:

   AC² = AB² + BC²

* **Step 3: Substitute the given values.**
   We know AB = 24 and BC = 16.  Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

   AC² = 24² + 16²
   AC² = 576 + 256
   AC² = 832

* **Step 4: Solve for AC.**
   Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

   AC = √832 
   AC ≈ 28.84

* **Step 5: Find CD.**
   Since ABCD is a trapezoid, we know that AD and BC are parallel.  Therefore, we can find CD by subtracting AB from AC:

   CD = AC - AB
   CD ≈ 28.84 - 24
   CD ≈ 4.84

∠FAE = [(1/2)∠FBD + ∠EBC] + [180° - 2∠ACE - ∠CEA]

∠FAE = 180° + (1/2)∠FBD + ∠EBC - 2∠ACE - ∠CEA

∠FAE = 180° + (1/2)∠FBD + (1/2)∠FBD - 2∠ACE - 145°

Simplifying, we get:

∠FAE = 35° - 2∠ACE

3,△ABC的两内角平分线OB、OC相交于点O，若∠A＝110°，则∠BOC＝（）,145°,"**Step 1: Understand the problem**

We are given a triangle ABC with two internal angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. We know that angle A is 110 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle BOC.

**Step 2: Apply the angle bisector theorem**

The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.

In our case, OB bisects angle ABC, so we can write:

```
AB/BC = AO/CO
```

Similarly, OC bisects angle ACB, so we can write:

```
AC/BC = AO/BO
```

**Step 3: Use the angle sum property of triangles**

The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

Applying this to triangle ABC, we get:

```
∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
```

Substituting ∠A = 110°, we get:

```
110° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
```

```
∠B + ∠C = 70°
```

**Step 4: Find the measure of angle BOC**

We know that ∠BOC is the sum of angles BOA and COA.

```
∠BOC = ∠BOA + ∠COA
```

Using the angle bisector theorem, we can write:

```
∠BOA = 1/2 ∠B
```

```
∠COA = 1/2 ∠C
```

Substituting these values in the equation for ∠BOC, we get:

```
∠BOC = 1/2 ∠B + 1/2 ∠C
```

```
∠BOC = 1/2 (∠B + ∠C)
```

Substituting ∠B + ∠C = 70°, we get:

```
∠BOC = 1/2 (70°)

∠BOC = 35°

∠A = 180° - 58° - 90°
∠A = 32°

Since lines a and b are parallel, angle 2 is an alternate interior angle to angle A. Alternate interior angles are equal, so:

∠2 = ∠A = 32°

Angle 1 is a corresponding angle to angle B. Corresponding angles are equal, so:

∠1 = ∠B = 58°

We are given a quadrilateral ABCD with specific angle measures. We need to find a point M on BC and a point N on CD such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized. Then, we need to find the sum of angles AMN and ANM.

**Step 2: Apply the concept of reflection**

To minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, we can use the concept of reflection. Reflect point A across line BC to get point A'. Similarly, reflect point A across line CD to get point A''.

**Step 3: Connect the points**

Connect points A' and A'' to point M and N, respectively. Now, we have two triangles: A'BM and A''DN.

**Step 4: Analyze the triangles**

Since A' is the reflection of A across BC, we have AB = A'B and ∠ABM = ∠A'BM. Similarly, AD = A''D and ∠ADN = ∠A''DN.

**Step 5: Apply the triangle inequality**

The perimeter of triangle AMN is AM + MN + AN. Using the triangle inequality, we have:

* AM + MB = A'B
* MN + ND = A''D
* AN = A'N = A''N

Therefore, the perimeter of triangle AMN is equal to A'B + A''D + A'N.

To minimize the perimeter, we need to minimize the sum of A'B + A''D + A'N. This sum is minimized when points A', A'', and N are collinear.

Since A', A'', and N are collinear, we have ∠A'MN + ∠A''NM = 180°.

Since △ABC ≌ △DEF, we know that ∠A = ∠D and ∠B = ∠E.  Therefore, ∠D = 22°.

Since CD bisects ∠BCA, we have ∠ACD = ∠BCD.  The sum of the angles in triangle ACD is 180°, so:

∠ACD + ∠CAD + ∠CDA = 180°
∠ACD + 22° + 22° = 180°
∠ACD = 136°

Since ∠ACD = ∠BCD, we have ∠BCA = 2 * ∠ACD = 2 * 136° = 272°.

**Step 2: Find the measure of angle ACG.**

We know that ∠CGF = 88°.  The sum of the angles in triangle ACG is 180°, so:

∠ACG + ∠CAG + ∠CGF = 180°
∠ACG + 22° + 88° = 180°
