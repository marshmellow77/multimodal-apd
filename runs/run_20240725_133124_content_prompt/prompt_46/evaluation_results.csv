643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ‚äôO, chord DE ‚à• OA, if the degree of ‚à†D is 50.0, then the degree of ‚à†C is ()",25¬∞,"Hey there! I see you're stuck on this geometry problem. Don't worry, we'll break it down together. 

## Problem:

The problem shows a circle with a diameter CD and a chord DE that's parallel to another line segment OA. We know that angle D is 50 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle C. 

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify key relationships:**  Since CD is the diameter, we know that angle COD is a straight angle, meaning it measures 180 degrees.  Also, because DE is parallel to OA, we have alternate interior angles: angle D and angle A are equal.

2. **Find angle A:**  Since angle D is 50 degrees, and angle D is equal to angle A, then angle A is also 50 degrees.

3. **Find angle COA:**  We know that angle COD is 180 degrees, and we just found that angle A (which is part of angle COD) is 50 degrees.  So, angle COA is 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees.

4. **Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc COA.  Since we know angle COA is 130 degrees, angle C is half of that, which is 130 degrees / 2 = 65 degrees.

## Answer:

The degree of angle C is **65 degrees**.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"Hey there! I see you're working with a right triangle. Don't worry, we can totally figure this out together! 

## Problem:

This problem is asking us to find the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) of a right triangle. We know one of the angles is 60 degrees and the length of one of the legs (the sides that form the right angle) is 4. 

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We can use the trigonometric ratio **sine** (sin) to solve for the hypotenuse. Sine is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side is the leg with length 4, and the hypotenuse is the side we're trying to find (h).

2. **Write the formula:** The formula for sine is: 
   sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse

3. **Plug in the values:** We know the angle is 60 degrees, the opposite side is 4, and the hypotenuse is h. So, we can plug these values into the formula:
   sin(60¬∞) = 4 / h

4. **Solve for h:** To isolate h, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by h:
   h * sin(60¬∞) = 4

5. **Divide both sides by sin(60¬∞):** This will give us the value of h:
   h = 4 / sin(60¬∞)

6. **Calculate sin(60¬∞):**  You can use a calculator to find that sin(60¬∞) = ‚àö3 / 2.

7. **Substitute and solve:** Now we can substitute this value back into our equation:
   h = 4 / (‚àö3 / 2)

8. **Simplify:** To divide by a fraction, we flip the fraction and multiply:
   h = 4 * (2 / ‚àö3)
   h = 8 / ‚àö3

9. **Rationalize the denominator:** To get rid of the radical in the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by ‚àö3:
   h = (8 / ‚àö3) * (‚àö3 / ‚àö3)
   h = 8‚àö3 / 3

## Answer:

The length of the hypotenuse (h) is **8‚àö3 / 3**.

**Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle AOC (the angle formed by points A, O, and C) in the diagram. We know that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle with center O, and that angle ABC measures 70 degrees. 

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Understanding Inscribed Angles:**  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share the same endpoint.  The important thing to remember is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

2. **Identifying the Central Angle:**  The central angle that intercepts the same arc as angle ABC is angle AOC.  

3. **Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** Since angle ABC is an inscribed angle and angle AOC is the corresponding central angle, we can use the theorem to find the measure of angle AOC.  The theorem states:

   *  **Measure of Inscribed Angle = (1/2) * Measure of Central Angle**

4. **Solving for the Central Angle:** We know that angle ABC (the inscribed angle) measures 70 degrees.  Let's plug that into the formula:

   *  70 degrees = (1/2) * Measure of angle AOC

5. **Isolating the Central Angle:** To find the measure of angle AOC, we need to solve for it.  Multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

   *  2 * 70 degrees = Measure of angle AOC

6. **Calculating the Answer:**  Finally, we can calculate the measure of angle AOC:

   *  Measure of angle AOC = 140 degrees

**Answer:**

The degree of angle AOC is 140 degrees.

## Problem:

The image shows a shape that looks like a rectangle with a triangle cut off from one corner.  The problem asks us to find the area of the whole shape.  We need to figure out how much space the whole shape takes up. 

## Solution Steps:

1. **Divide the shape:**  We can break this shape into two simpler shapes: a rectangle and a triangle.  Imagine drawing a line straight down from the top corner of the triangle to the bottom of the shape. This creates a rectangle on the left and a triangle on the right.

2. **Find the area of the rectangle:**  The rectangle has a length of 41 feet and a width of 48 feet.  To find the area of a rectangle, we multiply length times width. 
    * Area of rectangle = length * width
    * Area of rectangle = 41 ft * 48 ft
    * Area of rectangle = 1968 square feet

3. **Find the base of the triangle:** The base of the triangle is the difference between the total length of the shape (53 feet) and the length of the rectangle (41 feet).
    * Base of triangle = 53 ft - 41 ft = 12 ft

4. **Find the height of the triangle:** The height of the triangle is the same as the width of the rectangle, which is 48 feet.

5. **Find the area of the triangle:** The area of a triangle is calculated by multiplying the base by the height and then dividing by 2.
    * Area of triangle = (base * height) / 2
    * Area of triangle = (12 ft * 48 ft) / 2
    * Area of triangle = 576 square feet / 2
    * Area of triangle = 288 square feet

6. **Add the areas together:** To find the total area of the shape, we add the area of the rectangle and the area of the triangle.
    * Total area = Area of rectangle + Area of triangle
    * Total area = 1968 square feet + 288 square feet
    * Total area = 2256 square feet

Solution Steps:
1. **Visualize the problem:** Imagine drawing a line segment from P to Q. This line segment is also a radius of the larger circle, so it has a length of 4.
2. **Identify the relationship:** Notice that the line segment PQ is also the diameter of the smaller circle. This is because Q is the center of the smaller circle, and the diameter of a circle passes through its center.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Identify the key angles:**  We're given that angle AOD is 70 degrees.  We also know that ray OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it cuts angle BOC in half. 

2. **Find the measure of angle BOD:**  Since angles AOD and BOD form a straight line (180 degrees), we can find angle BOD by subtracting angle AOD from 180 degrees: 
   * Angle BOD = 180 degrees - 70 degrees = 110 degrees

3. **Find the measure of angle BOC:**  Angles BOD and BOC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees).  So, we can find angle BOC by subtracting angle BOD from 180 degrees:
   * Angle BOC = 180 degrees - 110 degrees = 70 degrees

What is the $x$ component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3?",0.17,"Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step. It looks like we're dealing with electrostatic forces, which means we're talking about the forces between charged particles. 

**Problem:**

The problem asks us to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.  Imagine you have a bunch of charged particles hanging out, and they're all pushing or pulling on each other. We want to figure out how much force is pushing or pulling on particle 3 specifically in the horizontal direction (the x-direction).

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Identify the forces acting on particle 3:**  Particle 3 is being pushed or pulled by particles 1, 2, and 4.  Let's figure out the direction of each force:
    * **Force from particle 1:**  Opposite charges attract, so particle 1 will pull particle 3 to the left (negative x-direction).
    * **Force from particle 2:**  Like charges repel, so particle 2 will push particle 3 to the right (positive x-direction).
    * **Force from particle 4:**  Like charges repel, so particle 4 will push particle 3 to the right (positive x-direction).

2. **Calculate the magnitude of each force:** We'll use Coulomb's Law to calculate the strength of each force. Coulomb's Law states:

    *  F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2 

    Where:
    * F is the force between two charges
    * k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.98755 √ó 10^9 N‚ãÖm^2/C^2)
    * q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the two charges
    * r is the distance between the two charges

    Let's calculate each force:
    * **Force from particle 1:**  F13 = k * |q1 * q3| / a^2
    * **Force from particle 2:**  F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / (2a)^2 
    * **Force from particle 4:**  F43 = k * |q4 * q3| / a^2

3. **Find the x-component of each force:**  Since we're only interested in the x-component of the net force, we need to figure out how much of each force is acting in the horizontal direction. 
    * **Force from particle 1:**  The force from particle 1 is entirely in the negative x-direction, so its x-component is just -F13.
    * **Force from particle 2:**  The force from particle 2 is entirely in the positive x-direction, so its x-component is just F23.
    * **Force from particle 4:**  The force from particle 4 is entirely in the positive x-direction, so its x-component is just F43.

4. **Add up the x-components:**  To find the net force in the x-direction, we add up the x-components of each individual force:

    *  F_net_x = -F13 + F23 + F43

5. **Plug in the values and calculate:**  Now we can plug in the values for the charges, the distance, and Coulomb's constant to get our final answer:

    * F_net_x = - (8.98755 √ó 10^9 N‚ãÖm^2/C^2) * |(100 √ó 10^-9 C) * (200 √ó 10^-9 C)| / (0.05 m)^2 + (8.98755 √ó 10^9 N‚ãÖm^2/C^2) * |(100 √ó 10^-9 C) * (200 √ó 10^-9 C)| / (2 * 0.05 m)^2 + (8.98755 √ó 10^9 N‚ãÖm^2/C^2) * |(200 √ó 10^-9 C) * (200 √ó 10^-9 C)| / (0.05 m)^2

## Problem:

This problem is asking us to find the measure of angle J in the triangle. We know the lengths of two sides of the triangle, and we know that angle L is a right angle (90 degrees).  We can use this information to find the missing angle.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the sides:**  We need to figure out which sides of the triangle are the opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse in relation to angle J. 
    * **Hypotenuse:** The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right triangle, and it's opposite the right angle. In this case, the hypotenuse is JK, which has a length of 14.
    * **Opposite:** The opposite side is the side across from the angle we're interested in (angle J). This is side LK, which has a length of 9.
    * **Adjacent:** The adjacent side is the side next to the angle we're interested in (angle J), but not the hypotenuse. This is side JL, which we don't know the length of yet.

2. **Choose the right trigonometric function:** Since we know the opposite side and the hypotenuse, we can use the sine function (sin). The sine function is defined as: 
    * **sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse**

3. **Set up the equation:** We know the opposite side is 9 and the hypotenuse is 14, so we can plug those values into the sine function:
    * **sin(J) = 9 / 14**

4. **Solve for the angle:** To find the measure of angle J, we need to use the inverse sine function (arcsin or sin‚Åª¬π). This function does the opposite of the sine function ‚Äì it tells us the angle that corresponds to a given sine value.

This problem shows a square grid with a triangle inside. The triangle's vertices are labeled A, B, and C, and they are all on the grid points.  A line segment AD is drawn perpendicular to BC, and we need to find the length of AD.  

Think of it like this: Imagine you're standing at point A and you want to know how far you need to walk straight down to reach the line BC. That distance is what we're trying to find!

## Solution Steps:

1. **Count the grid squares:**  First, let's count how many squares are along each side of the triangle.  
    *  AB is 4 squares long.
    *  BC is 3 squares long.
    *  AC is 5 squares long.

2. **Recognize the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Notice that triangle ABC is a right triangle (because AD is perpendicular to BC).  This means we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side length. The Pythagorean Theorem states:  a¬≤ + b¬≤ = c¬≤  where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle, and 'c' is the length of the longest side (the hypotenuse).

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**  We know AB = 4 and AC = 5.  Let's plug those values into the Pythagorean Theorem:
    *  4¬≤ + b¬≤ = 5¬≤

4. **Solve for the missing side:**  Now we need to solve for 'b', which represents the length of BC.
    *  16 + b¬≤ = 25
    *  b¬≤ = 9
    *  b = 3  (We take the positive square root because length cannot be negative)

5. **Find the area of triangle ABC:**  We can find the area of triangle ABC using the formula:  Area = (1/2) * base * height.  We know the base (BC) is 3 and the height (AD) is what we're trying to find.  Let's call the area of triangle ABC 'A'.
    *  A = (1/2) * 3 * AD

6. **Find the area of triangle ABC using a different method:**  We can also find the area of triangle ABC by using the formula:  Area = (1/2) * base * height, but this time using AB as the base and AC as the height.
    *  A = (1/2) * 4 * 5 = 10

7. **Equate the two area expressions:**  Since we've found the area of triangle ABC in two different ways, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:
    *  (1/2) * 3 * AD = 10

8. **Solve for AD:**  Now we can solve for AD, which is the length we're looking for.
    *  (3/2) * AD = 10
    *  AD = (10 * 2) / 3
    *  AD = 20/3

## Problem:

The problem shows a circle with a point O at its center.  Two lines, PA and PB, are tangent to the circle at points A and B, respectively.  A line segment CD is drawn tangent to the circle at point E, with point C on line PA and point D on line PB.  We're given that PA = 8.0, and we need to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Tangents:**  Remember that a tangent line to a circle touches the circle at exactly one point.  The key here is that the tangent line is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  So, OA is perpendicular to PA, and OB is perpendicular to PB.

2. **Equal Tangent Segments:**  Another important property of tangents is that if two tangents are drawn from the same external point, then the segments of the tangents from the external point to the points of tangency are equal.  This means that PA = PB = 8.0.

3. **Finding the Perimeter:**  The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides.  So, the perimeter of triangle PCD is PC + CD + PD.  We know that PA = PB = 8.0, and we need to find PC, CD, and PD.

4. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Since OA is perpendicular to PA, triangle OAP is a right triangle.  We know that OA is the radius of the circle, and PA = 8.0.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find OP:  OP¬≤ = OA¬≤ + AP¬≤

5. **Finding PC and PD:**  Since PC and PD are tangents to the circle, they are equal in length.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find PC (or PD) using triangle OPC (or OPD):  PC¬≤ = OP¬≤ + OC¬≤ (or PD¬≤ = OP¬≤ + OD¬≤)

6. **Finding CD:**  CD is the sum of CE and ED.  Since CE and ED are tangents to the circle, they are equal in length.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find CE (or ED) using triangle OCE (or ODE):  CE¬≤ = OC¬≤ + OE¬≤ (or ED¬≤ = OD¬≤ + OE¬≤)

7. **Adding the Sides:**  Finally, we can add PC, CD, and PD to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

## Answer:

To find the exact answer, we need the radius of the circle (OA).  Let's assume the radius is 'r'.  

* Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OAP:  OP¬≤ = r¬≤ + 8¬≤ = r¬≤ + 64
* Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OPC:  PC¬≤ = (r¬≤ + 64) + r¬≤ = 2r¬≤ + 64
* Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OCE:  CE¬≤ = r¬≤ + r¬≤ = 2r¬≤
* Therefore, CD = 2CE = 2‚àö(2r¬≤) = 2r‚àö2
* Perimeter of triangle PCD = PC + CD + PD = 2‚àö(2r¬≤ + 64) + 2r‚àö2 + 2‚àö(2r¬≤ + 64) = 4‚àö(2r¬≤ + 64) + 2r‚àö2

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle A.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Focus on the angles around point D:** Since BD is perpendicular to CD, we know that angle BDC is a right angle (90 degrees).  We also know that angle DBC is 54 degrees.  

2. **Find angle CDB:**  Since the angles around point D add up to 360 degrees, we can find angle CDB: 
   * Angle CDB = 360 degrees - angle BDC - angle DBC 
   * Angle CDB = 360 degrees - 90 degrees - 54 degrees = 216 degrees

3. **Use the angle bisector:**  Since CD bisects angle ACB, we know that angle ACD is equal to angle BCD.  We can find angle ACD (or BCD) by dividing angle CDB in half:
   * Angle ACD = angle BCD = angle CDB / 2 = 216 degrees / 2 = 108 degrees

4. **Focus on triangle ACD:**  We know that angle ACD is 108 degrees, and we want to find angle A.  Since the angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle A:
   * Angle A = 180 degrees - angle ACD - angle ADC
   * Angle A = 180 degrees - 108 degrees - 90 degrees = -18 degrees

5. **Check for errors:**  We got a negative angle, which doesn't make sense. This means we made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.  

**Answer:**

We need to go back and check our work. There seems to be an error in our calculations.  Let's try this again, focusing on the relationships between the angles and using the fact that angle A is equal to angle ABD. 

**Let's try this again!**

1. **Focus on triangle ABD:** We know that angle A is equal to angle ABD.  Since the angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle ADB:
   * Angle ADB = 180 degrees - angle A - angle ABD
   * Angle ADB = 180 degrees - 2 * angle A (since angle A = angle ABD)

2. **Focus on triangle BDC:** We know that angle DBC is 54 degrees and angle BDC is 90 degrees.  We can find angle BCD:
   * Angle BCD = 180 degrees - angle DBC - angle BDC
   * Angle BCD = 180 degrees - 54 degrees - 90 degrees = 36 degrees

3. **Use the angle bisector:** Since CD bisects angle ACB, we know that angle ACD is equal to angle BCD, which is 36 degrees.

4. **Focus on triangle ACD:** We know that angle ACD is 36 degrees and angle ADC is 180 degrees - 2 * angle A (from step 1).  We can find angle A:
   * Angle A + angle ACD + angle ADC = 180 degrees
   * Angle A + 36 degrees + (180 degrees - 2 * angle A) = 180 degrees
   * -angle A = -36 degrees
   * Angle A = 36 degrees

**Answer:**

The measure of angle A is 36 degrees.

**Problem:**

The image shows a triangle ABC with a median AD (a line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side). Point E is the midpoint of AD. The problem asks us to find the area of triangle ABC, given that the area of triangle ABE is 2.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Understanding Medians and Areas:**  A median divides a triangle into two triangles with equal areas. Since AD is a median of triangle ABC, the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD.

2. **Using the Midpoint Property:**  Since E is the midpoint of AD, line segment AE is half the length of AD.  

3. **Relating Areas:**  Triangle ABE and triangle ABD share the same base (AB). Since AE is half the length of AD, the height of triangle ABE is half the height of triangle ABD.  

4. **Calculating the Area of ABD:**  The area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height. Since the height of triangle ABE is half the height of triangle ABD, the area of triangle ABD is twice the area of triangle ABE.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABD is 2 * 2 = 4.

5. **Finding the Area of ABC:**  Since the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD, the area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of these two triangles.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 4 + 4 = 8.

160,Find x.,12,"Hey there! I see you're working with a right triangle. Don't worry, we can totally figure this out together! 

## Problem:

The problem is asking us to find the length of the missing side of a right triangle. We know the lengths of two sides: one is 9 and the other is 15. The missing side is labeled ""x"".  

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the type of triangle:** We have a right triangle, which means one of the angles is 90 degrees. This is important because we can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the missing side.

2. **Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We can write this as a formula: 
   *  a¬≤ + b¬≤ = c¬≤
   *  where 'c' is the hypotenuse, and 'a' and 'b' are the other two sides.

3. **Apply the theorem:** In our triangle, the hypotenuse is 15, and one of the other sides is 9. We're trying to find the length of the other side, which we've labeled 'x'. Let's plug these values into the Pythagorean theorem:
   *  9¬≤ + x¬≤ = 15¬≤

4. **Solve for x:** Now we need to solve for 'x'. Let's simplify the equation:
   *  81 + x¬≤ = 225
   *  x¬≤ = 225 - 81
   *  x¬≤ = 144

5. **Find the square root:** To get 'x' by itself, we need to take the square root of both sides of the equation:
   *  ‚àöx¬≤ = ‚àö144
   *  x = 12

* This problem is asking us to find the scale factor between two similar figures.  Similar figures have the same shape but different sizes.  The scale factor tells us how much bigger or smaller one figure is compared to the other.  In this case, we have two quadrilaterals (four-sided figures), one labeled Q and the other labeled Q'.  We need to figure out how much bigger Q' is compared to Q.

Solution Steps:
* **Step 1: Identify corresponding sides.**  Corresponding sides are sides that are in the same position on both figures.  In this case, the side of Q that has length 5 corresponds to the side of Q' that has length x.  We also know that the side of Q that has length 15 corresponds to the side of Q' that has length x + 15.

* **Step 2: Set up a proportion.**  A proportion is an equation that says two ratios are equal.  We can set up a proportion using the corresponding sides we identified in step 1.  The proportion will look like this:

  ```
  5 / x = 15 / (x + 15)
  ```

* **Step 3: Solve for x.**  To solve for x, we can cross-multiply.  This means multiplying the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction, and vice versa.  This gives us:

  ```
  5(x + 15) = 15x
  ```

* **Step 4: Simplify and solve for x.**  Distributing the 5 on the left side of the equation gives us:

  ```
  5x + 75 = 15x
  ```

  Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

  ```
  75 = 10x
  ```

  Dividing both sides by 10 gives us:

  ```
  x = 7.5
  ```

* **Step 5: Find the scale factor.**  The scale factor is the ratio of a side of Q' to the corresponding side of Q.  We can use either pair of corresponding sides to find the scale factor.  Let's use the sides with lengths 5 and x:

  ```
  Scale factor = x / 5 = 7.5 / 5 = 1.5
  ```

Answer:
* The scale factor from Q to Q' is 1.5.  This means that Q' is 1.5 times bigger than Q.  We can double-check this by making sure that the ratio of the other pair of corresponding sides is also 1.5:

  ```
  (x + 15) / 15 = (7.5 + 15) / 15 = 22.5 / 15 = 1.5

  Since both ratios are 1.5, we know that our answer is correct.",False,0,6.092611074447632,1099.0

Solution Steps:
1. **Understanding the Incenter Property:** The incenter of a triangle is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle. This means that the distance from the incenter to each side is the same. So, JQ = QN = QP.

2. **Focusing on Triangle JQN:** We can see that triangle JQN is a right triangle with a right angle at Q. We know the length of JN (16.5) and we need to find the length of JQ.

In our case, JN is the hypotenuse, and JQ and QN are the other two sides. So, we can write:

**Problem:**

The image shows a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of side AB. The perpendicular bisector intersects AB at point D and BC at point E. We're also given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13. The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Understanding Perpendicular Bisectors:** A perpendicular bisector cuts a line segment into two equal parts and forms a right angle with the line segment.  Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = 3 (half of AB).

2. **Using the Perimeter Information:** We know the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, which means AC + CE + AE = 13.

3. **Finding AC:** Since DE is a perpendicular bisector, we know that AE = CE.  Therefore, we can rewrite the perimeter equation as AC + 2AE = 13.

4. **Finding AE:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AE.  Since triangle ADE is a right triangle, we have:  AE¬≤ = AD¬≤ + DE¬≤.  We know AD = 3, but we need to find DE.

5. **Finding DE:**  We can use the fact that triangle BDE is also a right triangle.  We know BD = 3 and we can use the Pythagorean theorem again:  BE¬≤ = BD¬≤ + DE¬≤.  We need to find BE to solve for DE.

6. **Finding BE:**  We know that BC = BE + EC.  We also know that AC + CE + AE = 13 and AE = CE.  Therefore, AC + 2CE = 13.  Since AC = AB - BC, we can substitute to get (AB - BC) + 2CE = 13.  We know AB = 6, so we have (6 - BC) + 2CE = 13.  We also know that CE = AE, so we can substitute to get (6 - BC) + 2AE = 13.  We can now solve for BC and then find BE.

7. **Solving for DE:** Now that we know BE, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle BDE to find DE.

8. **Solving for AE:**  With DE and AD, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ADE to find AE.

9. **Finding the Perimeter of Triangle ABC:**  The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC.  We know AB = 6, and we can find BC and AC using the information we've calculated.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Draw a diagram:**  It's always helpful to draw a diagram to visualize the problem.  You can redraw the parallelogram from the image and label the points A, B, C, D, E, and F.

2. **Identify key properties:**  Remember that the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel.  Also, the angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.

3. **Use angle properties:** Since BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, we know that angle ABE = angle CBE. Similarly, since CF is the angle bisector of angle BCD, we know that angle BCF = angle DCF.

4. **Look for similar triangles:** Notice that triangles ABE and CBE share a common side BE and have equal angles (angle ABE = angle CBE). This means that triangles ABE and CBE are similar triangles.  The same logic applies to triangles BCF and DCF.

5. **Use the properties of similar triangles:**  Similar triangles have proportional sides.  Since triangles ABE and CBE are similar, we have the following proportion:  AB/BE = AE/CE.  Similarly, since triangles BCF and DCF are similar, we have the following proportion: BC/CF = BF/DF.

6. **Solve for the unknown lengths:** We know AB = 3 and AD = 4.  Since AE + ED = AD, we can write AE = AD - ED = 4 - ED.  Similarly, BF = AD - AF = 4 - AF.  We can substitute these values into the proportions we found in step 5.

7. **Simplify and solve for EF:**  We now have two equations with two unknowns (BE and CF).  We can solve for BE and CF using these equations.  Once we know BE and CF, we can use the fact that EF = BE + CF to find the length of EF.

**Answer:**

After solving the equations, we find that EF = **5**.

We have a trapezoid called ABCD. We know the lengths of three sides: AB = 24, AD = 23, and BC = 16. The problem wants us to find the length of the last side, CD.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Visualize the Trapezoid:** Imagine a trapezoid with two parallel sides (AB and CD) and two non-parallel sides (AD and BC).  Since AB and CD are parallel, we can think of them as the top and bottom of the trapezoid.

2. **Draw a Perpendicular:**  Let's draw a perpendicular line from point C to side AD, and call the point where it intersects AD as point E. This creates a right triangle,  CDE.

3. **Find the Length of AE:**  Since AB and CD are parallel, we know that AE = AB - BC.  So, AE = 24 - 16 = 8.

4. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** Now we have a right triangle CDE, where we know DE = AE = 8 and CD is the hypotenuse. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find CD:

This problem is asking us to find the measure of angle P (‚à†P) in the diagram. We're given some information about the circle and the angles formed by the lines intersecting it.  Think of it like a puzzle where we need to use the clues to figure out the missing piece.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Clues:** We know that ‚à†AOB (the central angle of ‚ÅÄAB) is 90 degrees and ‚à†COD (the central angle of ‚ÅÄCD) is 50 degrees. Remember, a central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle with its vertex at the center of the circle.

2. **Finding Inscribed Angles:**  Now, let's look at the inscribed angles. An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords with its vertex on the circle.  We can use the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. 

    *  ‚à†ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts ‚ÅÄAB. So, ‚à†ACB = 1/2 * ‚à†AOB = 1/2 * 90¬∞ = 45¬∞.
    *  ‚à†ADB is an inscribed angle that intercepts ‚ÅÄCD. So, ‚à†ADB = 1/2 * ‚à†COD = 1/2 * 50¬∞ = 25¬∞.

3. **Using the Angle Sum Property:**  We know that the angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's apply this to triangle PAB:

    * ‚à†P + ‚à†PAB + ‚à†PBA = 180¬∞

4. **Finding ‚à†PAB and ‚à†PBA:**  We need to find ‚à†PAB and ‚à†PBA. Notice that ‚à†PAB is an exterior angle of triangle ACB.  The Exterior Angle Theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.  Therefore:

    * ‚à†PAB = ‚à†ACB + ‚à†CAB = 45¬∞ + ‚à†CAB

    Similarly, ‚à†PBA is an exterior angle of triangle ADB. So:

    * ‚à†PBA = ‚à†ADB + ‚à†DAB = 25¬∞ + ‚à†DAB

5. **Putting it Together:** Now we can substitute the values we found into the equation from step 3:

    * ‚à†P + (45¬∞ + ‚à†CAB) + (25¬∞ + ‚à†DAB) = 180¬∞
    * ‚à†P + ‚à†CAB + ‚à†DAB = 110¬∞

6. **Final Step:**  Notice that ‚à†CAB and ‚à†DAB are supplementary angles (they add up to 180¬∞).  Therefore:

    * ‚à†CAB + ‚à†DAB = 180¬∞

    Substituting this into the equation from step 5:

    * ‚à†P + 180¬∞ = 110¬∞
    * ‚à†P = -70¬∞

## Answer:

‚à†P = -70¬∞

**Wait!** A negative angle doesn't make sense in this context.  Let's go back and check our work.  We made a mistake in step 5.  We should have added 45¬∞ and 25¬∞ to get 70¬∞, not 110¬∞.  Let's correct that:

* ‚à†P + 70¬∞ = 180¬∞
* ‚à†P = 110¬∞

**Problem:**

The problem shows a circle with a square inside it. The circle has an area of 18œÄ square units. We need to figure out how long each side of the square is.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Find the radius of the circle:**  We know the area of the circle is 18œÄ square units. The formula for the area of a circle is A = œÄr¬≤, where A is the area and r is the radius.  Let's plug in what we know: 18œÄ = œÄr¬≤.  To solve for r, we can divide both sides by œÄ: 18 = r¬≤.  Then, take the square root of both sides: ‚àö18 = r.  Simplifying the radical, we get r = 3‚àö2.

2. **Relate the radius to the square's diagonal:**  Imagine drawing a diagonal line across the square. This diagonal line also goes through the center of the circle and is the same length as the diameter of the circle.  Since the diameter is twice the radius, the diagonal of the square is 2 * 3‚àö2 = 6‚àö2.

2. **Use the given angle:** We're given that angle ADC is 26 degrees.

3. **Find angle CAD:** Since angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle CAD by subtracting the other two angles from 180:

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Identify the key information:** We know that D and E are midpoints, which means they divide the sides AC and AB into equal halves. This is important because it tells us that DE is a midsegment of triangle ABC.

2. **Midsegment Theorem:** The Midsegment Theorem states that the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.  

3. **Apply the Midsegment Theorem:** Since DE connects the midpoints of AC and AB, it's parallel to BC and half the length of BC.

4. **Find BC:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BC. The Pythagorean Theorem states: a¬≤ + b¬≤ = c¬≤, where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.

**Problem:**

The problem gives us a circle with a radius of 5.0 and a chord AB with a length of 8.0. It asks us to find the distance from the center of the circle (point O) to the chord AB.  Think of it like this: imagine you're standing at the center of the circle (point O) and you want to know how far you have to walk to reach the chord AB. 

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Visualize:**  Imagine drawing a line segment from the center of the circle (point O) to the midpoint of the chord AB. This line segment will be perpendicular to the chord AB.  This line segment is called the **perpendicular bisector** of the chord.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**  We now have a right triangle where:
    * The hypotenuse is the radius of the circle (5.0).
    * One leg is half the length of the chord (8.0 / 2 = 4.0).

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Understanding Tangents:** Remember that a tangent line to a circle touches the circle at exactly one point.  The key here is that the radius drawn to the point of tangency is always perpendicular to the tangent line. So, we know that OA is perpendicular to PA and OB is perpendicular to PB.

2. **Finding Angles:** Since OA is perpendicular to PA, angle OAP is a right angle (90 degrees). Similarly, angle OBP is also a right angle.

3. **Using the Properties of Quadrilaterals:**  Let's look at quadrilateral OAPB. We know that the sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360 degrees. We already know that angles OAP and OBP are 90 degrees each, and angle P is given as 50 degrees. So, we can find angle AOB:

   * Angle AOB = 360 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees.

4. **Focusing on Triangle AOB:** Now, let's focus on triangle AOB. We know that OA and OB are radii of the circle, so they are equal in length. This means triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle. In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. Therefore, angle OAB = angle OBA.

5. **Finding Angle OAB:**  We know that the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. So, in triangle AOB:

   * Angle OAB + angle OBA + angle AOB = 180 degrees
   * Angle OAB + angle OBA = 180 degrees - 130 degrees = 50 degrees
   * Since angle OAB = angle OBA, each of these angles is 50 degrees / 2 = 25 degrees.

6. **Finding Angle ACB:** Finally, let's look at angle ACB.  Angle ACB is the same as angle OAB (they are vertically opposite angles). Therefore, angle ACB = 25 degrees.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Focus on the angles we know:** We're given that angle BEC is 35 degrees. This is a good starting point because it's directly related to the angles we need to find.

2. **Use angle bisectors:**  The problem tells us that BE bisects angle FBD and CE bisects angle ACD. This means that BE divides angle FBD into two equal angles, and CE divides angle ACD into two equal angles.

3. **Find angle FBE:** Since BE bisects angle FBD, we know that angle FBE is half of angle FBD.  We don't know the exact measure of angle FBD, but we can use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.  Angle FBD and angle DBE are on a straight line, so angle FBD + angle DBE = 180 degrees.  Since BE bisects angle FBD, angle FBE = angle DBE.  Therefore, angle FBE = 1/2 * (180 degrees - angle DBE).

We don't know the exact measure of angle ACD, but we can use the fact that angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.  Angle ACD, angle BCE, and angle ECB are around point C, so angle ACD + angle BCE + angle ECB = 360 degrees.  Since CE bisects angle ACD, angle BCE = angle ACE.  Therefore, angle BCE = 1/2 * (360 degrees - angle ECB - angle ACE).

5. **Find angle ABE:**  We know that angle ABE + angle BEC + angle CBE = 180 degrees (angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees).  We know angle BEC is 35 degrees.  We can find angle CBE by using the fact that angle CBE = angle FBE + angle FBC.  We already found angle FBE in step 3.  We can find angle FBC by using the fact that angle FBC + angle CBE + angle EBD = 180 degrees (angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees).  We already found angle CBE in step 4.  We can find angle EBD by using the fact that angle EBD = angle DBE (since BE bisects angle FBD).  We already found angle DBE in step 3.  Therefore, we can find angle ABE.

6. **Find angle FAE:**  We know that angle FAE + angle ABE + angle BAE = 180 degrees (angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees).  We already found angle ABE in step 5.  We can find angle BAE by using the fact that angle BAE = angle BAC + angle CAE.  We can find angle BAC by using the fact that angle BAC + angle CAB + angle ABC = 180 degrees (angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees).  We already found angle ABC in step 5.  We can find angle CAB by using the fact that angle CAB = angle FBA (since AB is a straight line).  We already found angle FBA in step 3.  We can find angle CAE by using the fact that angle CAE = angle ACE (since CE bisects angle ACD).  We already found angle ACE in step 4.  Therefore, we can find angle FAE.

* The image shows two lines, labeled 'a' and 'b', that are cut by a third line. We need to find the value of 'x' that would make lines 'a' and 'b' parallel to each other.  Think of it like trying to make two train tracks run side-by-side without ever crossing!

Solution Steps:
1. **Identify the angle relationship:** The angles labeled (4x + 11)¬∞ and (8x + 1)¬∞ are called **alternate interior angles**.  They're on opposite sides of the transversal (the line that cuts the other two lines) and inside the two lines. 

2. **Apply the alternate interior angles theorem:** This theorem says that if two lines are parallel, then their alternate interior angles are equal.  So, we can set the two angle expressions equal to each other: 
   (4x + 11)¬∞ = (8x + 1)¬∞

3. **Solve for x:** Now we have an equation with one variable, 'x'. Let's solve for it!
   * Subtract 4x from both sides: 11¬∞ = 4x + 1¬∞
   * Subtract 1¬∞ from both sides: 10¬∞ = 4x
   * Divide both sides by 4: x = 2.5¬∞

Answer:
* The final answer is x = 2.5¬∞.  If we plug this value back into the original angle expressions, we get (4 * 2.5 + 11)¬∞ = 21¬∞ and (8 * 2.5 + 1)¬∞ = 21¬∞.  Since the alternate interior angles are equal, we know that lines 'a' and 'b' are parallel!

## Problem:

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle K, which is represented by  $m \angle K$.  We're given a quadrilateral (a four-sided shape) with two sides that are parallel (the top and bottom sides) and two sides that are not parallel (the left and right sides). This shape is called a trapezoid. We also know that one of the angles, angle M, is 80 degrees. 

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the key property of trapezoids:**  Trapezoids have a special property: the two angles on the same side of the non-parallel sides add up to 180 degrees.  This means that angle J and angle L, or angle K and angle M, add up to 180 degrees.

2. **Set up an equation:** Since we know angle M is 80 degrees, we can set up an equation to find angle K:  $m \angle K + 80^\circ = 180^\circ$

3. **Solve for angle K:** To isolate angle K, we need to subtract 80 degrees from both sides of the equation:
   $m \angle K + 80^\circ - 80^\circ = 180^\circ - 80^\circ$

Solution Steps:
1. **Remember the rule about the angles in a quadrilateral:** The angles inside any quadrilateral always add up to 360 degrees. So, we can write an equation:  angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D = 360 degrees.

2. **Area of an Equilateral Triangle:** The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is:

* The image shows a rectangle with some angles labeled. We need to find the measure of angle 2, which is one of the angles inside the rectangle. We know that angle 1 is 38 degrees.

Solution Steps:
* **Step 1: Understand the properties of a rectangle.**  A rectangle has four right angles (90 degrees each). This means that all the angles inside the rectangle add up to 360 degrees.

* **Step 2: Identify the relationship between angles 1 and 2.**  Angles 1 and 2 are adjacent angles within the rectangle, meaning they share a side.  Adjacent angles in a rectangle are supplementary, which means they add up to 180 degrees.

* **Step 3: Use the supplementary angle property to find angle 2.**  We know angle 1 is 38 degrees.  Since angles 1 and 2 are supplementary, we can set up an equation: 
    * angle 1 + angle 2 = 180 degrees
    * 38 degrees + angle 2 = 180 degrees

* **Step 4: Solve for angle 2.**  Subtract 38 degrees from both sides of the equation:

**Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the measure of a central angle in a circle. A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. In this case, the center of the circle is point K (even though it's not labeled in the image).  We need to figure out how many degrees are in one of those angles.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  The key here is that the square is inscribed in the circle. This means all four corners of the square touch the circle.  

2. **Finding the Central Angle:**  Imagine drawing lines from the center of the circle (point K) to each corner of the square (A, B, C, and D).  Each of these lines is a radius of the circle.  Since the square has four equal sides, each of these central angles will be equal.

3. **Using the Properties of a Circle:** A circle has 360 degrees.  Since we have four equal central angles, we can divide the total degrees in the circle by 4 to find the measure of each central angle.

**Formula:**

* **Central Angle = (Total Degrees in a Circle) / (Number of Equal Central Angles)**

**Answer:**

* Central Angle = 360 degrees / 4 = 90 degrees

**Double Check:**

* We know that a square has four right angles, each measuring 90 degrees.  Since the central angles we found are also 90 degrees, this makes sense!

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Recognize the Equation:** The equation x¬≤ + y¬≤ = 25 represents a circle. This is a standard form of the circle equation: (x - h)¬≤ + (y - k)¬≤ = r¬≤, where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius.

2. **Find the Center and Radius:** In our equation, h = 0 and k = 0, so the center of the circle is (0, 0). The radius is the square root of 25, which is 5.

3. **Visualize the Circle:**  Since the center is at (0, 0) and the radius is 5, the circle extends 5 units in all directions from the center.

**Problem:**

This problem is asking us to find the length of side *x* in the triangle.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  This problem involves secants of a circle, so we'll use the **Secant-Secant Theorem**. This theorem states that when two secants intersect outside a circle, the product of the external segment of one secant and its whole length is equal to the product of the external segment of the other secant and its whole length. 

2. **Set up the equation:**  Let's apply the Secant-Secant Theorem to our problem. We have:
    *  External segment of one secant: 9
    *  Whole length of one secant: 9 + *x*
    *  External segment of the other secant: 12.25
    *  Whole length of the other secant: 12.25 + 2*x*

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Identify the key relationship:**  The key here is that angle ACB is an inscribed angle, and angle BAO is a central angle.  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle, while a central angle is an angle formed by two radii that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.

**Problem:**

The image shows a circle with center B.  We know that the diameter of the circle is 8 (because AB is a radius and it's 8, and the diameter is twice the radius). We also know that CE is 13.5. The problem asks us to find the length of BD, which is a radius of the circle.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Identify the key relationships:**  We have a circle, and we know the diameter. We also have a chord (CE) and a radius (BD) that are related.  

2. **Use the relationship between chords and diameters:**  A key theorem in geometry states that if a chord is perpendicular to a diameter, then the chord is bisected by the diameter. This means that CD is half of CE.

3. **Calculate CD:** Since CE is 13.5, CD is half of that, which is 13.5 / 2 = 6.75.

4. **Recognize the right triangle:**  We now have a right triangle BDC, where BD is the hypotenuse, BC is one leg, and CD is the other leg.

5. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We can write this as:  a¬≤ + b¬≤ = c¬≤ where 'c' is the hypotenuse and 'a' and 'b' are the other two sides.

6. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:** In our triangle BDC, we know CD = 6.75 and BC = BD (since they are both radii of the circle).  Let's substitute these values into the Pythagorean Theorem:

   BD¬≤ = BC¬≤ + CD¬≤
   BD¬≤ = BD¬≤ + 6.75¬≤

7. **Solve for BD:**  We can simplify the equation:

   BD¬≤ - BD¬≤ = 6.75¬≤
   0 = 45.5625

   This doesn't make sense!  We made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.  

8. **Find the mistake:**  We made a mistake in step 6.  We can't have BD¬≤ on both sides of the equation.  Let's try again:

   BD¬≤ = BC¬≤ + CD¬≤
   BD¬≤ = BD¬≤ + 6.75¬≤

   Now, let's subtract BD¬≤ from both sides:

   0 = 6.75¬≤

   This still doesn't make sense!  We need to go back and check our work again.

9. **Realize the mistake:**  We made a mistake in step 3.  We said that CD is half of CE, but that's not true.  CD is only half of CE if CE is a diameter.  CE is a chord, not a diameter.

10. **Correct the mistake:**  We need to find a different way to find CD.  We know that BD is a radius and is 8.  We also know that BC is a radius and is also 8.  Since CD is part of BC, we can find CD by subtracting BD from BC:

   CD = BC - BD
   CD = 8 - 8
   CD = 0

11. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem again:**  Now that we know CD = 0, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BD:

   BD¬≤ = 64

Similar triangles have the same shape but different sizes, and their corresponding sides are proportional.

3. **Use the properties of similar triangles:**  Since triangle AEF is similar to triangle ABD, we can write the following proportion:

   EF/BD = AE/AB

4. **Find the length of BD:**  We know that AC is 6 units long, and since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BD.

    * Since angle 1 is equal to angle A, angle 1 = 32 degrees.

4. **Calculate the difference:** Now that we know angle 1 = 32 degrees and angle 2 = 32 degrees, we can find the difference:
    * Angle 1 - angle 2 = 32 degrees - 32 degrees = 0 degrees.

The final answer is **0 degrees**.

**Problem:**

The image shows a parallelogram (‚ñ±ABCD) with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point O. We're given the lengths of the diagonals (AC = 12.0, BD = 8.0) and one side of the parallelogram (AB = 7.0). The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle OAB.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Understanding Diagonals in Parallelograms:**  Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means they cut each other in half at their point of intersection (point O in our case). 

2. **Finding the Lengths of OA and OB:** Since diagonals bisect each other, we know:
   * OA = AC / 2 = 12.0 / 2 = 6.0
   * OB = BD / 2 = 8.0 / 2 = 4.0

3. **Perimeter of a Triangle:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides. In triangle OAB, we have:
   * Perimeter of ‚ñ≥OAB = OA + OB + AB

**Problem:**

The problem gives us a quadrilateral ABCD with some specific angle measurements. We need to find a point M on BC and a point N on CD so that the perimeter of triangle AMN is as small as possible.  Then, we need to figure out the sum of angles AMN and ANM. 

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Visualize the Problem:** Imagine you're folding the quadrilateral ABCD along the line AM.  Notice that point B would fold onto point D, and point M would be the midpoint of BD.  This is because the angles at B and D are both right angles, and the angles at A and C are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).

2. **Find the Midpoint:** Since we're folding the quadrilateral, point M is the midpoint of BD.  This means AM is the perpendicular bisector of BD.

3. **Minimize the Perimeter:**  To minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, we want to make AM and AN as short as possible.  Since AM is already the shortest distance from A to BD, we need to find the shortest distance from A to CD.  This happens when AN is perpendicular to CD.

4. **Right Triangles:** Now we have two right triangles: AMB and AND.  Since AM is the perpendicular bisector of BD, we know that BM = MD.  Also, since AN is perpendicular to CD, we know that CN = ND.

This problem shows us a diagram with parallel lines and a transversal line cutting through them. We need to find the value of 'y'.  The diagram gives us two angles, one with the expression '2x + 6' and the other with the expression '3/5y + 2'.  We need to figure out how these angles are related and use that relationship to solve for 'y'.

Solution Steps:
1. **Identify the angle relationship:**  The two angles with expressions '2x + 6' and '3/5y + 2' are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are in the same position relative to the transversal line and the parallel lines.  They are always equal to each other.

2. **Set up an equation:** Since corresponding angles are equal, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:

**Problem:**

The problem shows us a diagram with two triangles, ABC and DEF. We know that these triangles are congruent, meaning they have the same shape and size.  We also know that line CD bisects angle BCA, meaning it cuts the angle in half.  We're given that angle A is 22 degrees and angle CGF is 88 degrees. The question asks us to find the measure of angle E.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Understanding Congruent Triangles:** Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. This means that angle A is equal to angle D, angle B is equal to angle E, and angle C is equal to angle F.

2. **Finding Angle C:** We know that angle A is 22 degrees. Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle C: 
   * Angle C = 180 degrees - angle A - angle B 
   * Angle C = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - angle B

3. **Finding Angle B:** We know that CD bisects angle BCA, meaning it cuts the angle in half.  We also know that angle CGF is 88 degrees.  Since angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle BCG:
   * Angle BCG = 180 degrees - angle CGF
   * Angle BCG = 180 degrees - 88 degrees = 92 degrees

   Since CD bisects angle BCA, we know that angle BCF is half of angle BCG:
   * Angle BCF = angle BCG / 2
   * Angle BCF = 92 degrees / 2 = 46 degrees

   Now we can find angle B:
   * Angle B = 180 degrees - angle C - angle BCF
   * Angle B = 180 degrees - angle C - 46 degrees

4. **Finding Angle E:** Since angle B is equal to angle E, we can now find angle E:
   * Angle E = angle B

To get the final answer, we need to substitute the values we found for angle C and angle B into the equations above.  Once we have the value for angle B, we know that angle E is equal to that value.

**Problem:**

The image shows a circle with center O.  Line segment AB is a diameter of the circle, meaning it passes through the center O and divides the circle in half. Points C and D are also on the circle.  The problem tells us that angle BCD is 25 degrees.  We need to figure out the measure of angle AOD.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Identify key relationships:**  Since AB is a diameter, we know that angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

2. **Use the angle sum property of triangles:**  In triangle BCD, we know that the sum of all angles is 180 degrees.  We're given that angle BCD is 25 degrees, and we know angle ACB is 90 degrees.  So, angle CBD = 180 - 90 - 25 = 65 degrees.

3. **Central angle theorem:**  Angle AOD is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle.  The central angle theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.  In this case, angle AOD intercepts the same arc as angle CBD.

**Problem:**

The problem gives us a triangle ABC with points M, N, P, and Q inside. We know that A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ. We also know that angle BAC is 110 degrees. The problem asks us to find the size of angle PAQ.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Understanding Symmetry:**  Symmetry means that if you fold the figure along the line of symmetry, the two halves will perfectly match. So, since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, we know that line MP is the perpendicular bisector of line AB. This means that MP cuts AB in half and forms a 90-degree angle with AB.  The same logic applies to A and C with respect to line NQ.

2. **Finding Key Angles:**  Since MP is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that angle AMP is 90 degrees. Similarly, angle ANQ is 90 degrees.

3. **Using Angle Properties:**  We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's look at triangle AMP:
    * Angle AMP = 90 degrees (from step 2)
    * Angle BAM = 1/2 * angle BAC = 1/2 * 110 degrees = 55 degrees (because A and B are symmetrical, so angle BAM is half of angle BAC)
    * Therefore, angle MAP = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 55 degrees = 35 degrees.

4. **Finding Angle PAQ:**  Now, let's look at triangle ANQ:
    * Angle ANQ = 90 degrees (from step 2)
    * Angle CAN = 1/2 * angle BAC = 1/2 * 110 degrees = 55 degrees (because A and C are symmetrical, so angle CAN is half of angle BAC)
    * Therefore, angle NAQ = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 55 degrees = 35 degrees.

5. **Final Calculation:**  Finally, we can find angle PAQ:
    * Angle PAQ = angle MAP + angle NAQ = 35 degrees + 35 degrees = 70 degrees.

**Problem:**

The image shows a circle with two chords intersecting inside the circle. We know that chord CH is congruent to chord KJ, and we need to find the value of x.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  We're dealing with intersecting chords inside a circle.  The key theorem here is that the measures of the angles formed by intersecting chords are equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

2. **Label the intercepted arcs:** Let's call the arc intercepted by angle CHJ ""arc CJ"" and the arc intercepted by angle KJH ""arc KH"".

3. **Set up an equation:**  Since CH is congruent to KJ, we know that arc CJ is congruent to arc KH.  Let's use the theorem we mentioned earlier to set up an equation:

   *  (1/2) * (arc CJ + arc KH) = (2x - 27)¬∞ 

4. **Simplify the equation:** Since arc CJ and arc KH are congruent, we can replace them with the same variable, let's say ""y"":

   * (1/2) * (y + y) = (2x - 27)¬∞
   * (1/2) * (2y) = (2x - 27)¬∞
   * y = (2x - 27)¬∞

5. **Find the value of y:** We know that the measure of arc GHJ is 83¬∞.  Since arc CJ and arc KH are congruent, we can find the measure of y:

   * y + y + 83¬∞ = 360¬∞ (The sum of the measures of the arcs in a circle is 360¬∞)
   * 2y + 83¬∞ = 360¬∞
   * 2y = 277¬∞

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Set up an equation:** Since the triangle is equilateral, we know that all sides are equal. So, we can set the expressions for the sides equal to each other:

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle 2, which is inside the triangle. We're also given that angle 1, which is formed by the triangle and line l2, measures 76 degrees.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Identify the key relationships:**  We know that l1 and l2 are parallel lines. This means that any angles formed by a line that intersects both of them will have special relationships. 

2. **Focus on angle 1:**  Angle 1 is formed by line l2 and one of the sides of the triangle.  Since l1 and l2 are parallel, angle 1 and the angle next to it on the same side of line l2 (let's call it angle A) are supplementary angles. This means they add up to 180 degrees.

3. **Calculate angle A:**  We know angle 1 is 76 degrees, so angle A is 180 degrees - 76 degrees = 104 degrees.

4. **Look at the triangle:** Now we're focusing on the triangle. We know one angle is 30 degrees, another is 90 degrees (the right angle), and the third is angle A, which we just calculated as 104 degrees.

5. **Apply the angle sum property:** The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180 degrees. So, angle 2 + 30 degrees + 104 degrees = 180 degrees.

**Problem:**

The problem shows a circle with two lines intersecting inside it. One line is a chord (a line segment that connects two points on the circle), and the other line is a tangent (a line that touches the circle at only one point). We're given that the angle formed by the chord and the tangent is 30 degrees, and the angle formed by the chord and the radius drawn to the point of tangency is (4x + 50) degrees. We need to find the value of x.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  We need to use the **Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem**. This theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

2. **Find the intercepted arc:** The intercepted arc is the part of the circle that lies between the points where the tangent and chord intersect the circle. In this case, the intercepted arc is the arc that goes from the point where the tangent touches the circle to the point where the chord intersects the circle.

3. **Apply the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem:**  Since the angle formed by the tangent and chord is 30 degrees, the intercepted arc has a measure of 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.

4. **Set up an equation:** The angle formed by the chord and the radius is (4x + 50) degrees. This angle is also half the measure of the intercepted arc, which we know is 60 degrees. So, we can set up the equation: (4x + 50) = 60/2

The image shows an isosceles right triangle. We need to find the y-coordinate of its center of mass. Imagine the triangle is made of a thin, evenly distributed material. The center of mass is the point where the triangle would balance perfectly if you were to hold it there.

Solution Steps:
1. **Understanding the Center of Mass:** The center of mass of a shape is like its average position. For a triangle, it's usually not in the exact center. We need to find the y-coordinate, which means we're looking for how high up the center of mass is.

This problem is asking us to find the total resistance between points 'a' and 'b' in an infinitely long chain of resistors. Imagine you have a bunch of resistors all connected in a specific way, and we want to know how much resistance there is from one end of the chain to the other.  

Solution Steps:
1. **Simplify the circuit:**  The first thing we need to do is simplify the circuit. Notice that the resistors are connected in a repeating pattern. We can focus on one section of the circuit and use that to find the total resistance. Let's look at the first three resistors. 

2. **Identify series and parallel connections:**  The two resistors on the top are connected in parallel, meaning they share the same two points. The resistor on the bottom is connected in series with the combination of the two top resistors.

3. **Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel resistors:**  The formula for calculating the equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel is: 
    * 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2
    * In our case, R1 = R and R2 = R. So, 1/R_total = 1/R + 1/R = 2/R.
    * Solving for R_total, we get R_total = R/2.

4. **Calculate the equivalent resistance of the series combination:**  The formula for calculating the equivalent resistance of two resistors in series is:
    * R_total = R1 + R2
    * In our case, R1 = R/2 (from the parallel combination) and R2 = R. So, R_total = R/2 + R = 3R/2.

5. **Recognize the repeating pattern:**  Now, we have the equivalent resistance of the first three resistors. Notice that this equivalent resistance is connected in parallel with the next resistor in the chain. This pattern repeats infinitely.

6. **Use the concept of infinite geometric series:**  The equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain can be represented as an infinite geometric series:
    * R_total = 3R/2 + (3R/2)^2/R + (3R/2)^3/R^2 + ...
    * The first term is 3R/2, and the common ratio is 3R/2R = 3/2.

7. **Apply the formula for infinite geometric series:**  The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is:
    * S = a / (1 - r)
    * Where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio.
    * In our case, a = 3R/2 and r = 3/2.
    * Therefore, R_total = (3R/2) / (1 - 3/2) = (3R/2) / (-1/2) = -3R.

8. **Consider the negative sign:**  The negative sign in the answer indicates that the resistance is negative. This is not physically possible. The negative sign arises from the way we set up the infinite series. In reality, the resistance of an infinite chain of resistors will approach a finite value.

9. **Find the actual resistance:**  To find the actual resistance, we need to take the absolute value of the result:
    * R_total = |-3R| = 3R.

Answer:
The resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is 3R. Since R = 1, the total resistance is 3 * 1 = 3 ohms.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Find the side length of each square:**  Remember that the area of a square is side * side (side¬≤). Since the area of each square is 9, we need to find the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 9. That number is 3 (3 * 3 = 9). So, each side of the square is 3 units long.

The image shows two parallel lines, *a* and *b*, intersected by a third line, *c*.  We know that angle 1 is 62 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle 2.  Think of it like this: we have two parallel streets, and a diagonal road cuts through them. We know the angle of one corner where the diagonal road meets the first street, and we want to find the angle of a different corner where the diagonal road meets the second street.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between the angles:**  Angle 1 and angle 2 are **corresponding angles**. Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal (the line that cuts through the parallel lines) intersects two parallel lines. They are in the same relative position at each intersection.

2. **Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate:** The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the corresponding angles are congruent (meaning they have the same measure).

**Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle NCL.  That's the angle formed by the lines CN and CL.  We're given some information about other angles in the circle, and we need to use that to figure out the measure of angle NCL.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Angles around a point:**  Remember that the angles around a point always add up to 360 degrees.  So, we can write an equation:  ‚à†NCR + ‚à†RCN + ‚à†NCL + ‚à†LCM = 360¬∞.

2. **Substitute known values:** We know that ‚à†RCN = (x - 1)¬∞, ‚à†NCL = (3x + 5)¬∞, and ‚à†LCM = 60¬∞.  Let's substitute those values into our equation: (x - 1)¬∞ + ‚à†NCR + (3x + 5)¬∞ + 60¬∞ = 360¬∞.

3. **Simplify the equation:** Combine the like terms: 4x + ‚à†NCR + 64¬∞ = 360¬∞.

4. **Solve for ‚à†NCR:**  To find ‚à†NCR, we need to isolate it. Subtract 4x and 64¬∞ from both sides of the equation: ‚à†NCR = 296¬∞ - 4x.

5. **Find x:**  We still need to find the value of x to get the measure of ‚à†NCR.  Since we know that ‚à†NCR + ‚à†RCN = 180¬∞ (because they form a straight line), we can substitute the expressions we have for these angles: (296¬∞ - 4x) + (x - 1)¬∞ = 180¬∞.

6. **Solve for x:** Simplify the equation: 295¬∞ - 3x = 180¬∞.  Subtract 295¬∞ from both sides: -3x = -115¬∞.  Divide both sides by -3: x = 38.33¬∞.

7. **Calculate ‚à†NCR:** Now that we know x, we can find ‚à†NCR: ‚à†NCR = 296¬∞ - 4(38.33¬∞) = 149.33¬∞.

8. **Calculate ‚à†NCL:** Finally, we can find ‚à†NCL: ‚à†NCL = (3x + 5)¬∞ = (3 * 38.33¬∞ + 5)¬∞ = 119¬∞.

**Problem:**

The problem is asking us to find the measure of angle x. We know that ABCDEF is a regular hexagon, which means all its sides are equal and all its angles are equal. We also know that point O is the center of the hexagon. 

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Find the measure of each interior angle of the hexagon:**
   * We know that the sum of the interior angles of any polygon with *n* sides is given by the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees.
   * For a hexagon, n = 6, so the sum of its interior angles is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.
   * Since all the angles in a regular hexagon are equal, each angle measures 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.

2. **Focus on triangle ABO:**
   * We know that angle ABO is one of the interior angles of the hexagon, so it measures 120 degrees.
   * Triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle because OA and OB are radii of the hexagon and therefore equal.
   * This means that angles BAO and ABO are equal.

3. **Find the measure of angle BAO:**
   * The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.
   * In triangle ABO, we have angle ABO = 120 degrees and angle BAO = angle ABO.
   * Therefore, angle BAO = (180 - 120) / 2 = 30 degrees.

4. **Find the measure of angle x:**
   * Angle x is the same as angle BAO because they are opposite angles.
   * Therefore, x = 30 degrees.

* The image shows a circle with a triangle inscribed inside it. The problem asks us to find the value of 'x' by using the angles of the triangle.  Think of it like a puzzle where we need to figure out the missing piece!

Solution Steps:
* **Step 1: Identify the angles.** We have two angles in the triangle: one is (5x - 12) degrees and the other is 3x degrees.

* **Step 2: Remember the angle rule.**  The angles inside a triangle always add up to 180 degrees. This is a super important rule that helps us solve for missing angles.

* **Step 3: Set up an equation.** We can write an equation to represent the sum of the angles in the triangle: (5x - 12) + 3x + 90 = 180.  We added 90 degrees because the angle at point D is a right angle (90 degrees).

* **Step 4: Solve for x.** Now we need to solve for 'x' in the equation. Let's simplify it:
    * 8x - 12 + 90 = 180
    * 8x + 78 = 180
    * 8x = 102
    * x = 102 / 8
    * x = 12.75

Answer:
* The final answer is x = 12.75. We can double-check by plugging this value back into the original angles: (5 * 12.75 - 12) = 51.75 degrees and 3 * 12.75 = 38.25 degrees.  Adding these together with 90 degrees gives us 180 degrees, confirming our answer!

Solution Steps:
* **Step 1: Find the measure of angle WYZ.**  Since angles WXZ and WYZ are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees), we can find the measure of angle WYZ by subtracting the measure of angle WXZ from 180 degrees. 
    *  180 degrees - 130 degrees = 50 degrees.
    * So, the measure of angle WYZ is 50 degrees.

* **Step 2: Find the measure of angle ZIY.**  Since angles WZG and ZIY are vertical angles (they share the same vertex and are opposite each other), they have the same measure.
    * So, the measure of angle ZIY is 20 degrees.

* **Step 3: Use the given ratio to determine the relationship between the angles of triangle JHI.**  The given ratio tells us that the sides of triangle JHI are proportional. This means that the angles of triangle JHI are also proportional.  
    * Since the ratio of IJ to XJ is equal to the ratio of HJ to YJ, we know that angle IJH is proportional to angle JYX.

* **Step 4: Find the measure of angle JYX.**  Since angles WYZ and JYX are supplementary angles, we can find the measure of angle JYX by subtracting the measure of angle WYZ from 180 degrees.
    * 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees.
    * So, the measure of angle JYX is 130 degrees.

* **Step 5: Find the measure of angle IJH.**  Since angle IJH is proportional to angle JYX, and angle JYX is 130 degrees, we know that angle IJH is also 130 degrees.

* **Step 6: Find the measure of angle YIZ.**  The angles inside triangle JHI add up to 180 degrees.  We know that angle IJH is 130 degrees and angle ZIY is 20 degrees.  We can find the measure of angle YIZ by subtracting the measures of the other two angles from 180 degrees.

**Problem:**

The image shows a circle with a point B outside the circle.  A line segment connects point B to point A on the circle, and another line segment connects point B to point C on the circle.  The problem tells us that the measure of minor arc AC is x degrees, and the measure of major arc ADC is y degrees.  We also know that the measure of angle ABC is 70 degrees.  The problem asks us to find the value of x.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  The key here is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle ABC is an inscribed angle because its vertex is on the circle, and its sides intersect the circle at points A and C.  The intercepted arc for angle ABC is arc AC.

2. **Setting up the Equation:**  We know that the measure of angle ABC is 70 degrees, and we know that the measure of arc AC is x degrees.  Using the relationship from step 1, we can write the equation:  
   *  ‚à†ABC = (1/2) * arc AC

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**  Remember that an angle bisector divides an angle into two equal parts.  So, since CD bisects angle ACB, we know that angle ACD is equal to angle BCD.  Similarly, BE bisects angle ABC, so angle ABE is equal to angle CBE.

2. **Finding Angle ACF:**  Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know that angle AGC is a right angle (90 degrees).  We also know that angle ACG is 32 degrees.  The angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees, so we can find angle ACF:

    * Angle ACF = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 32 degrees = 58 degrees

3. **Finding Angle BCF:**  We know that angle ACB is bisected by CD, so angle ACD = angle BCD.  Since angle ACF is 58 degrees, and angle ACD is half of angle ACB, then angle BCD is also 58 degrees.

2. **Central Angle:**  Angle AOB is a central angle of the pentagon, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle. Since the pentagon is regular, the central angle divides the circle into five equal arcs.  Therefore, angle AOB measures 360 degrees / 5 = 72 degrees.

3. **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  Angle ADE is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as central angle AOB. The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  So, angle ADE measures 72 degrees / 2 = 36 degrees.

**Answer:**

The measure of angle ADE is 36 degrees.

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"Okay, let's break this problem down together!

**Problem:**

The problem shows us two line segments that meet at a point on a line called ""l"". We're given that one angle is 70 degrees, and the other two angles are labeled ""x"" and ""y"". The problem tells us that y is equal to the square of x. We need to find the value of y.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Find x:** We know that the angles around a point add up to 360 degrees. So, we can write an equation: x + y + 70 = 360. 
2. **Substitute y:** We're told that y = x¬≤. Let's substitute that into our equation: x + x¬≤ + 70 = 360.
3. **Simplify the equation:** Combine like terms: x¬≤ + x + 70 = 360. Then, subtract 360 from both sides: x¬≤ + x - 290 = 0.
4. **Solve for x:** This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it by factoring: (x + 17)(x - 17) = 0. This gives us two possible solutions: x = -17 or x = 17. Since angles can't be negative, we know x = 17.
5. **Find y:** We know y = x¬≤, so y = 17¬≤ = 289.

**Answer:**

The value of y is 289.
