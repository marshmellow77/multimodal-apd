643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"**1. Problem:**

* We are given a circle with center O, diameter CD, and chords DE and OA. We know that DE is parallel to OA and that angle D measures 50 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle C.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
    * Since CD is a diameter, angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.
    * Because DE is parallel to OA, we have alternate interior angles: angle D = angle OAE = 50 degrees.
    * Angle COA is the sum of angles OAE and EAO.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
    * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * Angle C intercepts arc AD, and angle COD intercepts the same arc. Therefore, angle C = (1/2) * angle COD.

* **Step 3: Calculate angle C.**
    * We know angle COD = 180 degrees.
    * Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem, angle C = (1/2) * 180 degrees = 90 degrees.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"**1. Problem:**
* We need to find the length of the hypotenuse, *h*, of a right triangle given one leg is 4 units long and the angle opposite that leg is 60 degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**
* **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio to use.**
    * We know the opposite side (4) and we want to find the hypotenuse (*h*). 
    * The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function:  sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse.
* **Step 2: Set up the equation.**
    * We know the angle is 60 degrees, the opposite side is 4, and the hypotenuse is *h*. 
    * So, the equation is: sin(60°) = 4/*h*
* **Step 3: Solve for *h*.**
    * Multiply both sides of the equation by *h*: *h* * sin(60°) = 4
    * Divide both sides by sin(60°): *h* = 4 / sin(60°)
    * Calculate sin(60°) using a calculator or trigonometric table: sin(60°) = √3/2
    * Substitute the value of sin(60°) into the equation: *h* = 4 / (√3/2)
    * Simplify the expression: *h* = 8/√3
    * Rationalize the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by √3: *h* = (8/√3) * (√3/√3) = 8√3/3

**3. Answer:**
* The length of the hypotenuse, *h*, is 8√3/3 units.

    * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

* **Step 2: Identify the relevant angles.**
    * Angle ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AC.
    * Angle AOC is a central angle that intercepts arc AC.

* **Step 3: Apply the relationship between inscribed and central angles.**
    * Since angle ABC is half the measure of angle AOC, we can write:

* We need to find the measure of angle AOE, given that line AB and CD intersect at point O, ray OE bisects angle BOC, and angle AOD is 70 degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the problem.**
    * We have two lines intersecting at a point, forming four angles.
    * One of the angles (AOD) is given as 70 degrees.
    * A ray (OE) bisects another angle (BOC), meaning it divides it into two equal angles.
    * We need to find the measure of angle AOE.

* **Step 2: Identify the relationship between angles.**
    * Angles AOD and BOC are vertically opposite angles, which means they are equal. So, angle BOC is also 70 degrees.
    * Ray OE bisects angle BOC, meaning angle BOE and angle COE are equal.

* **Step 3: Calculate the measure of angle BOE.**
    * Since angle BOC is 70 degrees and OE bisects it, angle BOE is half of 70 degrees, which is 35 degrees.

* We need to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**
    * Particle 1 exerts a force on particle 3, which we'll call F13.
    * Particle 2 exerts a force on particle 3, which we'll call F23.
    * Particle 4 exerts a force on particle 3, which we'll call F43.

* **Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of each force using Coulomb's Law.**
    * Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
    * The formula for Coulomb's Law is: F = k * q1 * q2 / r^2, where:
        * F is the force between the charges
        * k is Coulomb's constant (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
        * q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges
        * r is the distance between the charges

    * Let's calculate the magnitude of each force:
        * F13 = k * |q1| * |q3| / (a√2)^2 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m * √2)^2 = 0.36 N
        * F23 = k * |q2| * |q3| / a^2 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m)^2 = 0.72 N
        * F43 = k * |q4| * |q3| / a^2 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (200 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m)^2 = 1.44 N

* **Step 3: Determine the direction of each force.**
    * F13 is attractive because q1 and q3 have opposite signs, and it acts along the diagonal of the square.
    * F23 is repulsive because q2 and q3 have the same sign, and it acts horizontally to the right.
    * F43 is repulsive because q4 and q3 have the same sign, and it acts vertically upwards.

* **Step 4: Find the x-component of each force.**
    * F13x = F13 * cos(45°) = 0.36 N * cos(45°) = 0.25 N
    * F23x = F23 = 0.72 N
    * F43x = 0 N (since F43 is vertical)

* **Step 5: Add the x-components of all the forces to find the net x-component of the force on particle 3.**
    * Fnetx = F13x + F23x + F43x = 0.25 N + 0.72 N + 0 N = 0.97 N

* The x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is 0.97 N.

* We are given a 4x4 grid with each square having a side length of 1. Points A, B, and C are located on the grid points.  A line segment AD is drawn perpendicular to line segment BC, forming a right angle at point D. We need to find the length of AD.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the coordinates of points A, B, and C.**
    *  Looking at the grid, we can see that point A is at (3, 4), point B is at (0, 0), and point C is at (4, 1).

* **Step 2: Calculate the slope of line BC.**
    * The slope of a line is calculated using the formula:  (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    * Using the coordinates of B and C, we get: (1 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 1/4.

* **Step 3: Calculate the slope of line AD.**
    * Since AD is perpendicular to BC, the slopes of these two lines are negative reciprocals of each other. 
    * The negative reciprocal of 1/4 is -4.

* **Step 4: Find the equation of line AD.**
    * We know the slope of AD is -4 and it passes through point A (3, 4). We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation: y - y1 = m(x - x1)
    * Plugging in the values, we get: y - 4 = -4(x - 3)
    * Simplifying the equation, we get: y = -4x + 16

* **Step 5: Find the x-coordinate of point D.**
    * Point D lies on both line AD and line BC. To find its x-coordinate, we need to find the x-value where the equations of these two lines intersect.
    * We know the equation of line BC is y = (1/4)x.
    * Setting the y-values of both equations equal to each other, we get: -4x + 16 = (1/4)x
    * Solving for x, we get: x = 4/17

* **Step 6: Find the y-coordinate of point D.**
    * We can plug the x-coordinate of D (4/17) into either the equation of line AD or line BC to find the y-coordinate.
    * Using the equation of line BC, we get: y = (1/4) * (4/17) = 1/17

* **Step 7: Calculate the length of AD.**
    * We now know the coordinates of points A (3, 4) and D (4/17, 1/17).
    * We can use the distance formula to find the length of AD: √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)
    * Plugging in the coordinates, we get: √((4/17 - 3)² + (1/17 - 4)²) = √(425/289) = 5/17

* The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle PCD, given that PA and PB are tangents to circle O at points A and B respectively, CD is tangent to circle O, and PA = 8.0.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand Tangent Properties**
   *  A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means angles OAC and OBC are right angles.
   *  Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. This means PA = PB = 8.0.

* **Step 2: Identify Congruent Triangles**
   *  Triangles OAC and OBC are congruent because they share a common side (OC), have equal hypotenuses (OA = OB), and both have right angles.

* **Step 3:  Find the Length of CD**
   *  Since triangles OAC and OBC are congruent, their corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, AC = BC.
   *  CD is a common side to both triangles ACD and BCD.
   *  Triangles ACD and BCD are also congruent because they have two equal sides (AC = BC and CD is common) and a shared angle (∠ACD = ∠BCD).
   *  Therefore, AD = BD.
   *  The perimeter of triangle PCD is PC + CD + PD. Since PC = PA - AC and PD = PB - BD, and we know PA = PB and AC = BC, we can simplify the perimeter to:
      * Perimeter = (PA - AC) + CD + (PB - BD) = PA + CD + PB - (AC + BD) = PA + CD + PB - (AC + AC) = PA + CD + PB - 2AC.
   *  Since PA = PB = 8.0 and CD is the diameter of the circle, we need to find the diameter to calculate the perimeter.

* **Step 4: Find the Diameter of the Circle**
   *  Let's draw a line segment from O to the midpoint of CD, which we'll call M. This line segment is a radius of the circle and is perpendicular to CD.
   *  Now we have a right triangle OCM. Since OC is a radius and CM is half the diameter, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius:
      * OC² = CM² + OM²
      * Since OM is also a radius, we can rewrite this as:
      * OC² = CM² + OC²
      * This means CM² = 0, which implies CM = 0.
      * Therefore, the diameter of the circle is CD = 2CM = 0.

* **Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter**
   *  Now we can calculate the perimeter of triangle PCD:
      * Perimeter = PA + CD + PB - 2AC = 8.0 + 0 + 8.0 - 2AC = 16.0 - 2AC.
   *  Since we don't have enough information to find AC, we can't determine the exact numerical value of the perimeter.

**3. Answer:**

* The perimeter of triangle PCD is 16.0 - 2AC, where AC is the length of line segment AC. We cannot determine the exact numerical value of the perimeter without knowing the length of AC.

* **Step 2: Find angle BDC.**  We know BD is perpendicular to CD, so angle BDC is a right angle, which is 90 degrees.

* **Step 3: Find angle CBD.** We know angle DBC is 54 degrees, and angle BDC is 90 degrees. The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, so angle CBD is 180 - 54 - 90 = 36 degrees.

* **Step 4: Find angle ABD.** We know angle A equals angle ABD, and we know angle CBD is 36 degrees. The angles around point B add up to 360 degrees, so angle ABD is 360 - 36 - 90 = 234 degrees.

* **Step 2:  Recognize the relationship between the areas of triangles with the same height.**  Triangles ABE and ABD share the same height (the perpendicular distance from point A to line BC). Since E is the midpoint of AD, the base of triangle ABD is twice the base of triangle ABE.
* **Step 3: Apply the formula for the area of a triangle.** The area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height. 
* **Step 4: Calculate the area of triangle ABD.** Since the base of triangle ABD is twice the base of triangle ABE, and they share the same height, the area of triangle ABD is twice the area of triangle ABE. Therefore, the area of triangle ABD is 2 * 2 = 4.
* **Step 5:  Recognize the relationship between the areas of triangles with the same base.** Triangles ABD and ABC share the same base (line BC). Since D is the midpoint of BC, the height of triangle ABC is twice the height of triangle ABD.
* **Step 6: Calculate the area of triangle ABC.** Since the height of triangle ABC is twice the height of triangle ABD, and they share the same base, the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle ABD. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 2 * 4 = 8.

* We need to find the length of line segment $JQ$ in the given triangle $JLN$. We know that point $Q$ is the incenter of the triangle and the length of line segment $JN$ is 16.5.

**2. Solution Steps:**
* **Understanding the Incenter:** The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. It is also the center of the triangle's inscribed circle.
* **Incenter Property:** An important property of the incenter is that it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle. This means the distance from the incenter to each side is the same.
* **Using the Property:** Since $Q$ is the incenter, the distance from $Q$ to side $JL$ (which is $JQ$) is equal to the distance from $Q$ to side $JN$ (which is $QN$).

* **Putting it Together:**
    1. Find the semiperimeter of triangle $JLN$: $s = \frac{16.5 + 9 + JL}{2}$
    2. We need to find $JL$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $JKL$ to find $JL$. We know $JK = 9$ and $KL = 16.5$.
    3. Using the Pythagorean theorem: $JL^2 = JK^2 + KL^2 = 9^2 + 16.5^2 = 342.25$
    4. Therefore, $JL = \sqrt{342.25} = 18.5$

* The problem asks us to find the length of line segment EF in parallelogram ABCD, given that AB = 3, AD = 4, and the angle bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCD intersect AD at points E and F, respectively.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the properties of angle bisectors.** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. In this case, BE bisects ∠ABC, so ∠ABE = ∠CBE. Similarly, CF bisects ∠BCD, so ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

* **Step 2: Identify congruent triangles.**  Notice that triangles ABE and CBE share side BE and have equal angles (∠ABE = ∠CBE and ∠BAE = ∠BCE because opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal). Therefore, triangles ABE and CBE are congruent by the Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) congruence theorem.

* **Step 3: Use congruent triangles to find AE and DE.** Since triangles ABE and CBE are congruent, their corresponding sides are equal. This means AE = CE.  Similarly, triangles BCF and DCF are congruent, so DF = CF.

* **Step 4: Apply the properties of parallelograms.** In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, AD = BC.  We know AD = 4, so BC = 4.

* **Step 5: Use the information to find EF.** Since AE = CE and DF = CF, we can write:
    * AD = AE + EF + DF

* **Step 4: Solve for ∠DOE.** Combining like terms, we get 2∠DOE = 180°. Dividing both sides by 2, we find ∠DOE = 90°.

* **Step 5: Identify the angles that form a vertical angle pair.** Angles BOC and EOD are vertical angles, which means they are equal. Therefore, ∠EOD = ∠BOC = 50°.

    * The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.
    * We can plug in the area and solve for the radius:

* We have a right triangle ABC with a right angle at C.  Point D is the midpoint of the hypotenuse AB, and we know AB = 10. We need to find the length of CD.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Midpoint Theorem**
   * The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
* **Step 2: Apply the Midpoint Theorem**
   * Since D is the midpoint of AB, CD is the line segment joining the midpoint of AB to the vertex C. 
   * Therefore, CD is parallel to BC and half the length of BC.
* **Step 3: Find BC**
   * We know AB = 10 and ∠ACB = 90°.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BC:
      *  a² + b² = c² 
      *  AC² + BC² = AB²
      *  BC² = AB² - AC²
      *  BC² = 10² - AC² 
      *  Since we don't know AC, we can't find the exact value of BC.
* **Step 4: Find CD**
   * We know CD is half the length of BC.  
   * Therefore, CD = BC / 2.

* We need to find the measure of angle ACB, given that PA and PB are tangents to circle O, AC is the diameter of circle O, and angle P is 50 degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand Tangent Properties**
   * Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. This means PA = PB.
   * The angle between a tangent and the radius drawn to the point of contact is always 90 degrees. So, ∠OAB = ∠OBA = 90 degrees.

* **Step 2: Apply Angle Properties**
   * In triangle PAB, we know PA = PB (from Step 1), so it's an isosceles triangle. Therefore, ∠PAB = ∠PBA.
   * The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, in triangle PAB, ∠P + ∠PAB + ∠PBA = 180 degrees.
   * Since ∠P = 50 degrees and ∠PAB = ∠PBA, we can write: 50 + 2 * ∠PAB = 180.
   * Solving for ∠PAB, we get ∠PAB = (180 - 50) / 2 = 65 degrees.

* **Step 3: Find ∠ACB**
   * In triangle OAB, we know ∠OAB = 90 degrees and ∠PAB = 65 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠OBA = 180 - 90 - 65 = 25 degrees.
   * Since AC is the diameter, ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the entire circle. This means ∠ACB is half the measure of the central angle ∠AOB.
   * ∠AOB = 180 - ∠OAB - ∠OBA = 180 - 90 - 25 = 65 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠ACB = ∠AOB / 2 = 65 / 2 = 32.5 degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between the sides of a right triangle and the areas of squares built on them.**
    * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. 
    * In this problem, the side of length 14 is the hypotenuse.
    * We can write this as:  hypotenuse² = side1² + side2²

* We have a right triangle ABC with a right angle at A. The triangle is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around point A to form triangle AB'C'. We are given that angle CC'B' is 32 degrees and we need to find the measure of angle AC'B'.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the Rotation**
   * When we rotate a triangle 90 degrees clockwise, each point of the triangle moves 90 degrees in a clockwise direction around the center of rotation. This means that angle BAC will become angle B'AC', and angle ABC will become angle AB'C'.

* **Step 2: Identify Key Angles**
   * Since angle BAC is a right angle (90 degrees), angle B'AC' is also a right angle.
   * We are given that angle CC'B' is 32 degrees.

* **Step 3: Use Angle Properties**
   * The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle AB'C', we have:
      * angle AB'C' + angle AC'B' + angle B'AC' = 180 degrees
   * We know that angle B'AC' is 90 degrees.
   * We also know that angle AB'C' is equal to angle ABC (because of the rotation). Since angle ABC is a right angle (90 degrees), angle AB'C' is also 90 degrees.

* **Step 4: Solve for the Unknown Angle**
   * Substituting the known angles into the equation from Step 3, we get:
      * 90 degrees + angle AC'B' + 90 degrees = 180 degrees
   * Simplifying the equation:
      * angle AC'B' = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees = 0 degrees

* **Step 5: Consider the Special Case**
   * We have found that angle AC'B' is 0 degrees. This means that points A, C', and B' are collinear (they lie on the same line). This is a special case that arises because of the 90-degree rotation.

* The problem asks us to find the measure of angle FAE, given that angle BEC is 35 degrees, BE bisects angle FBD, and CE bisects angle ACD.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand angle bisectors.**  A bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Since BE bisects angle FBD, we know that angle FBE is equal to angle EBD. Similarly, since CE bisects angle ACD, we know that angle ACE is equal to angle ECD.

* **Step 2: Use the angle sum property of triangles.** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.  Let's apply this to triangle BEC:
    *  ∠BEC + ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 180°
    *  35° + ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 180°
    *  ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 145°

* **Step 3:  Find the measure of angle BCD.** Since CE bisects angle ACD, we know that angle BCE is half of angle BCD. Therefore, angle BCD = 2 * angle BCE.

* **Step 4: Find the measure of angle ABC.**  Since BE bisects angle FBD, we know that angle CBE is half of angle ABC. Therefore, angle ABC = 2 * angle CBE.

* **Step 5:  Find the measure of angle BAC.**  The sum of the interior angles of triangle ABC is 180 degrees:
    * ∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°
    * ∠BAC + 2 * ∠CBE + 2 * ∠BCE = 180°
    * ∠BAC + 2 * (∠CBE + ∠BCE) = 180°
    * ∠BAC + 2 * 145° = 180°
    * ∠BAC = 180° - 290° = -110°

* **Step 6:  Find the measure of angle FAE.**  Since angle BAC is negative, it means that angle FAE is an exterior angle of triangle ABC. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles:
    * ∠FAE = ∠ABC + ∠ACB
    * ∠FAE = 2 * ∠CBE + 2 * ∠BCE

* The problem asks us to find the area of triangle ABC' given that the areas of triangles A'BC and AB'C are 10 and 4, respectively. We also know that triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at A.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between the areas of equilateral triangles and their sides.**
    * The area of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula: Area = (√3/4) * side²
    * This means that the area of an equilateral triangle is directly proportional to the square of its side length.

* **Step 2: Find the side lengths of triangles A'BC and AB'C.**
    * Let the side length of triangle A'BC be a and the side length of triangle AB'C be b.
    * Using the area formula, we have:
        * 10 = (√3/4) * a²
        * 4 = (√3/4) * b²
    * Solving for a and b, we get:
        * a = √(40/√3)
        * b = √(16/√3)

* **Step 3: Recognize that the sides of triangle ABC are also the sides of the equilateral triangles.**
    * Since triangle A'BC is built on side BC, the side length of triangle A'BC (a) is equal to the length of BC.
    * Similarly, the side length of triangle AB'C (b) is equal to the length of AB.

* **Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AC.**
    * The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
    * In triangle ABC, AC is the hypotenuse, so we have:
        * AC² = AB² + BC²
        * AC² = b² + a²
        * AC² = (16/√3) + (40/√3)
        * AC² = 56/√3
        * AC = √(56/√3)

* **Step 5: Calculate the area of triangle ABC'.**
    * The area of an equilateral triangle is (√3/4) * side².
    * The side length of triangle ABC' is AC, which we found to be √(56/√3).
    * Therefore, the area of triangle ABC' is:
        * Area = (√3/4) * (√(56/√3))²
        * Area = (√3/4) * (56/√3)
        * Area = 14

*  In the given circle with center O, AB is the diameter, EF and EB are chords, point E is the midpoint of FEB, EF intersects AB at point C, and OF is connected. If ∠AOF = 40°, find the measure of ∠F.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify key relationships**
    * Since AB is the diameter, ∠AEB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem).
    * Since E is the midpoint of FEB, ∠FE = ∠EB.
    * ∠AOF is a central angle, and ∠F is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
    * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * Therefore, ∠F = 1/2 * ∠AOF = 1/2 * 40° = 20°.

* **Step 3: Find ∠FEB**
    * Since ∠AEB is a right angle, ∠FEB = 90° - ∠FE.
    * Since ∠FE = ∠EB, we can write ∠FEB = 90° - ∠EB.

* **Step 4: Find ∠F**
    * In triangle FEB, the sum of the angles is 180°.
    * Therefore, ∠F + ∠FEB + ∠EB = 180°.
    * Substituting the values we found, we get 20° + (90° - ∠EB) + ∠EB = 180°.
    * Simplifying the equation, we get 110° = 180°.

    * Since G is the midpoint of chord EF, we know that OG is perpendicular to EF.
    * We are given that ∠DCF = 20°.

* We need to find the measure of angle C (∠C) in the circle. We are given that ∠D = 35 degrees and ∠AEC = 105 degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between angles in a circle.**
    * When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of each angle formed is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
    * In this case, ∠AEC intercepts arcs AC and BD, and ∠D intercepts arcs AD and BC.

* **Step 2: Apply the angle relationship to find the measure of arc AC.**

    *  Angle AOB is a straight angle (180 degrees) because it is formed by the diameter AB.

* **Step 2: Use angle relationships in a triangle**
    *  In triangle AOC, we know that angle A = 25 degrees and angle OCB = 90 degrees.

* We need to find the measure of angle BOC in triangle ABC, given that OB and OC are angle bisectors of angles B and C respectively, and angle A is 110 degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1:** Understand angle bisectors. An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. So, angle ABO = angle OBC and angle ACO = angle OCB.

* **Step 2:** Apply the angle sum property of a triangle. The sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, in triangle ABC, angle A + angle B + angle C = 180 degrees.

* **Step 3:** Substitute the given value of angle A. We know angle A = 110 degrees. So, 110 degrees + angle B + angle C = 180 degrees.

* **Step 4:** Solve for the sum of angles B and C. Subtracting 110 degrees from both sides, we get angle B + angle C = 70 degrees.

* **Understanding Symmetry:** Symmetry means that if we fold the triangle along the line of symmetry, the two halves will perfectly overlap. 
* **Symmetry and Angles:** When two points are symmetrical with respect to a line, the line bisects the angle formed by the two points and any point on the line.
* **Applying Symmetry to the Problem:**
    * Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, line MP bisects ∠BAM. This means ∠BAP = ∠MAP.
    * Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, line NQ bisects ∠CAN. This means ∠CAQ = ∠NAQ.
* **Finding ∠PAQ:**
    * We know ∠BAC = 110°.
    * We can write ∠BAC as the sum of ∠BAP + ∠PAQ + ∠CAQ.

* Find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of an isosceles right triangle with uniform areal density. The triangle has sides of length 'a'.

**2. Solution Steps:**
* **Understanding Center of Mass:** The center of mass is the point where the entire mass of an object can be considered to be concentrated. For symmetrical objects, it's often at the geometric center.
* **Symmetry:** The triangle is symmetrical about the y-axis. This means the center of mass must lie on the y-axis.
* **Dividing the Triangle:** Imagine dividing the triangle into thin horizontal strips. Each strip has a small mass, and its center of mass is at its midpoint.
* **Weighted Average:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass is the weighted average of the y-coordinates of the centers of mass of all the strips. The weight of each strip is its mass.
* **Calculating the y-coordinate:**
    * Let's consider a strip at a distance 'y' from the base of the triangle. Its width is '2x' (from the symmetry).
    * The area of the strip is approximately '2x * dy' (where 'dy' is the thickness of the strip).
    * The mass of the strip is proportional to its area: 'dm = k * 2x * dy' (where 'k' is a constant of proportionality).
    * The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the strip is 'y'.
    * The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the entire triangle is:
        * y_cm = (∫y * dm) / (∫dm)
        * where the integrals are taken over the entire triangle.
    * To solve this, we need to express 'x' in terms of 'y'. Using similar triangles, we get: x/y = a/(a/2) => x = 2y.
    * Substituting this in the above equation and integrating, we get:
        * y_cm = (∫y * k * 2 * 2y * dy) / (∫k * 2 * 2y * dy)

* We need to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b' in an infinite chain of resistors, where each resistor has a resistance of 'R' (which is equal to 1).

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Understanding the Circuit:** The circuit is a combination of series and parallel connections. We can break it down into smaller sections to analyze it.

* **Simplifying the Circuit:**
    * Imagine taking a section of the circuit from point 'a' to the point where the next set of resistors starts. This section consists of three resistors in parallel (R, R, and R) followed by one resistor in series (R).
    * The equivalent resistance of three resistors in parallel is given by: 1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R. Therefore, R_parallel = R/3.
    * This equivalent resistance (R/3) is in series with another resistor (R). So, the total resistance of this section is R/3 + R = 4R/3.

* **Infinite Chain:** Now, the key is to realize that the rest of the infinite chain beyond this section is identical to the original circuit. This means the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain is the same as the resistance of the section we just analyzed.

* **Setting up an Equation:** Let 'X' be the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain. We can write an equation: X = 4R/3 + X/3. This equation represents the total resistance (X) being equal to the resistance of the first section (4R/3) plus the resistance of the rest of the infinite chain (X/3).

* **Solving for X:** Solving for X, we get: 2X/3 = 4R/3. Therefore, X = 2R.

* Since R = 1, the equivalent resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is X = 2 * 1 = **2 ohms**.

280,"In the figure above, ABCDEF is a regular hexagon, and its center is point O. What is the value of x?",60,"**1. Problem:**
* We need to find the value of x in the given figure, where ABCDEF is a regular hexagon and O is its center.

**2. Solution Steps:**
* **Step 1:**  A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles. 
* **Step 2:** The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees. 
* **Step 3:** Since all angles are equal in a regular hexagon, each interior angle measures 720/6 = 120 degrees.

* **Step 5:**  Triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle because OA and OB are radii of the hexagon. Therefore, angle BAO = angle ABO = 60 degrees.
* **Step 6:**  The sum of the angles in triangle ABO is 180 degrees. So, x + 60 + 60 = 180.
* **Step 7:**  Solving for x, we get x = 180 - 60 - 60 = 60 degrees.

* We need to find the value of *x* in the given diagram.

**2. Solution Steps:**
* **Step 1:** Identify the type of angles. The angles in the diagram are inscribed angles. An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords in a circle that share a common endpoint.
* **Step 2:** Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem. The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Step 3:**  The intercepted arc for angle *3x* is the same as the intercepted arc for angle *(5x - 12)*. Therefore, the measure of angle *3x* is half the measure of the intercepted arc, and the measure of angle *(5x - 12)* is also half the measure of the same intercepted arc. This means that the two angles are equal.
* **Step 4:** Set up an equation: 3x = 5x - 12

* We need to find the measure of angle YIZ, given that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, angle WXJ = 130 degrees, and angle WZG = 20 degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant angles and lines.**
    * We are given that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. This means that line segment GJ is a transversal that intersects line segments WJ and YJ, creating similar triangles.
    * We are also given that angle WXJ = 130 degrees and angle WZG = 20 degrees.

* **Step 2: Use the properties of similar triangles.**
    * Since triangles WXJ and YJZ are similar, their corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle YJZ = angle WXJ = 130 degrees.

* **Step 3: Use the properties of angles on a straight line.**
    * Angles WZG and GZY are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle GZY = 180 degrees - 20 degrees = 160 degrees.

* **Step 4: Find the measure of angle YIZ.**
    * Angle YIZ is the difference between angle GZY and angle YJZ. Therefore, angle YIZ = 160 degrees - 130 degrees = 30 degrees.

* We need to find the value of *x*, which represents the degree measure of minor arc AC. We know that the measure of angle ABC is 70 degrees, and the measure of major arc ADC is *y*.

**2. Solution Steps:**
* **Step 1: Understand the relationship between angles and arcs.**  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share the same endpoint on the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, angle ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc ADC.

* **Step 2: Apply the relationship to the problem.** Since angle ABC measures 70 degrees, the measure of arc ADC (its intercepted arc) is twice that, or 70 * 2 = 140 degrees.

* **Step 3: Use the fact that the total measure of a circle is 360 degrees.**  We know that the measure of arc ADC is 140 degrees, and the measure of arc AC is *x*.  Since these two arcs make up the entire circle, we can write the equation: *x* + 140 = 360.

* We need to find the measure of angle D (∠D) in the given figure. We know that AB is the diameter of circle O, DB and DC are tangents to the circle at points B and C, and ∠ACE = 25°.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Understand Tangent-Radius Property**
   * A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠DBO = ∠DCO = 90°.

* **Step 2: Identify Key Angles**
   * We know ∠ACE = 25°. Since ∠ACB is a straight angle (180°), we can find ∠BCB: ∠ACB - ∠ACE = ∠BCB, so 180° - 25° = 155°.

* **Step 3: Apply Triangle Angle Sum Property**
   * In triangle BCO, we know ∠BCO = 90° (tangent-radius property) and ∠CBO = 90° (tangent-radius property). Using the triangle angle sum property (angles in a triangle add up to 180°), we can find ∠BOC: 180° - 90° - 90° = 0°.

* **Step 4: Find ∠BOD**
   * Since ∠BOC = 0° and ∠BOD is a straight angle (180°), we have ∠BOD = 180° - 0° = 180°.

* **Step 5: Apply Triangle Angle Sum Property Again**
   * In triangle BOD, we know ∠DBO = 90° (tangent-radius property) and ∠BOD = 180°. Using the triangle angle sum property, we can find ∠D: 180° - 90° - 180° = -90°. However, angles cannot be negative. This means ∠D is actually 90°.

* Find the perimeter of the parallelogram.

**2. Solution Steps:**
* **Step 1:**  The perimeter of a shape is the total distance around the outside. To find the perimeter of a parallelogram, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides. 
* **Step 2:** We know that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal. So, the top side of the parallelogram is also 23 ft long.
* **Step 3:** To find the length of the left side, we can use trigonometry. We know that the angle between the base and the height is 60 degrees, and the base is 23 ft. We can use the sine function to find the height: sin(60°) = height / 23 ft.
* **Step 4:** Solving for the height, we get: height = 23 ft * sin(60°) = 23 ft * (√3 / 2) = 11.5√3 ft.
* **Step 5:** Since the height is also the length of the left side, the left side is 11.5√3 ft long.
* **Step 6:** The right side is also 11.5√3 ft long.
* **Step 7:** Now we can add up the lengths of all four sides to find the perimeter: Perimeter = 23 ft + 16 ft + 23 ft + 11.5√3 ft + 11.5√3 ft = 73 ft + 23√3 ft.

* We need to find the measure of angle ∠BCD in the given circle. We know that AB is the diameter of the circle, point O is the center, and ∠ABD = 50 degrees.

**2. Solution Steps:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles and the diameter.**
   *  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, we know that angle ∠ADB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

* **Step 2: Use the angle sum property of triangles.**
   * In triangle ABD, we know that ∠ADB = 90 degrees and ∠ABD = 50 degrees. 
   * The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
   * Therefore, ∠BAD = 180 - ∠ADB - ∠ABD = 180 - 90 - 50 = 40 degrees.

* **Step 3: Understand the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.**
   *  Angle ∠BCD is an inscribed angle, and angle ∠BOD is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠BCD.
   * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

* **Step 4: Calculate the measure of the central angle.**
   * Since ∠BAD = 40 degrees, and ∠BOD is the central angle intercepting the same arc, ∠BOD = 2 * ∠BAD = 2 * 40 = 80 degrees.

* **Step 5: Calculate the measure of the inscribed angle.**
   *  ∠BCD is an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc as ∠BOD. Therefore, ∠BCD = 1/2 * ∠BOD = 1/2 * 80 = 40 degrees.
