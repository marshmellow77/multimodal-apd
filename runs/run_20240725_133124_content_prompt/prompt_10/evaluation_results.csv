643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem:

In a circle with center O, diameter CD, and chord DE parallel to chord OA, angle D measures 50 degrees. Find the measure of angle C.

## Solution:

1. **Identify key relationships:**

   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Parallel Lines:** When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**

   * Angle D is an inscribed angle intercepting arc CE.
   * Therefore, the measure of arc CE is twice the measure of angle D: 2 * 50° = 100°.

3. **Apply the Central Angle Theorem:**

   * Angle COD is a central angle intercepting arc CE.
   * Therefore, the measure of angle COD is equal to the measure of arc CE: 100°.

4. **Apply Parallel Lines Property:**

   * Since DE is parallel to OA, angle COD and angle CAO are corresponding angles.
   * Therefore, angle CAO also measures 100°.

5. **Find angle C:**

   * Angle C is part of triangle CAO.
   * The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180°.
   * Therefore, angle C = 180° - angle CAO - angle OAC = 180° - 100° - 100° = -20°.

## Answer:

The measure of angle C is **-20°**. 

**Important Note:**  A negative angle measurement is unusual. This indicates that there might be an error in the problem statement or the diagram. It's always a good idea to double-check the information provided and the diagram for any inconsistencies.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## Problem:

Find the length of the hypotenuse, *h*, of a right triangle with one leg of length 4 and an angle of 60 degrees.

## Solution:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We have the length of the adjacent side (4) and we want to find the hypotenuse (*h*). The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is the cosine: 
   * **cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse**

2. **Apply the cosine function:** In our triangle, the angle is 60 degrees. So, we can write:
   * **cos(60°) = 4 / *h***

3. **Solve for *h*:** To isolate *h*, we can multiply both sides of the equation by *h* and then divide both sides by cos(60°):
   * ***h* * cos(60°) = 4**
   * ***h* = 4 / cos(60°)**

4. **Calculate cos(60°):**  The cosine of 60 degrees is a well-known value: cos(60°) = 1/2.

5. **Substitute and simplify:** Now we can substitute the value of cos(60°) into our equation:
   * ***h* = 4 / (1/2)**
   * ***h* = 4 * 2**
   * ***h* = 8**

## Answer:

The length of the hypotenuse, *h*, is 8.

A triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle with center O.  Angle ABC is 70 degrees.  What is the measure of angle AOC?

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Inscribed Angles:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share a common endpoint on the circle.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

2. **Identifying the Relevant Arc:**  Angle ABC intercepts arc AC.  Angle AOC is the central angle that intercepts the same arc AC.

3. **Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** Since angle ABC is an inscribed angle and angle AOC is the corresponding central angle, we can use the inscribed angle theorem:

   *  ∠ABC = (1/2) ∠AOC

4. **Solving for ∠AOC:**  We know ∠ABC = 70 degrees.  Substituting this into the equation from step 3, we get:

   *  70° = (1/2) ∠AOC

   *  ∠AOC = 2 * 70° = 140°

Two concentric circles are given. The radius of the larger circle is 4. Point R lies on the circumference of both circles.  We need to find the radius of the smaller circle.

## Solution:

1. **Visualize the problem:** Imagine drawing a line segment from the center of the larger circle (P) to point R. This line segment is the radius of the larger circle and also passes through the center of the smaller circle (Q).

2. **Identify the relationship:** The line segment PR is the sum of the radius of the smaller circle (PQ) and the radius of the larger circle (QR).

Two lines, AB and CD, intersect at point O. Ray OE bisects angle BOC. If angle AOD is 70 degrees, what is the measure of angle AOE?

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the problem:** We are given that line AB and CD intersect at point O, forming four angles. Ray OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides angle BOC into two equal angles. We need to find the measure of angle AOE.

2. **Identifying relevant angles:**
    * **Angle AOD:** This is given as 70 degrees.
    * **Angle BOD:** Since angles AOD and BOD are supplementary (they add up to 180 degrees), we can find angle BOD: 180 degrees - 70 degrees = 110 degrees.
    * **Angle BOC:** Angles BOD and BOC are also supplementary, so angle BOC is 180 degrees - 110 degrees = 70 degrees.
    * **Angle BOE and COE:** Since OE bisects angle BOC, angle BOE and angle COE are equal and each is half of angle BOC: 70 degrees / 2 = 35 degrees.

Four charged particles are arranged at the corners of a square. The charges are:

* q1 = -100 nC
* q2 = 100 nC
* q3 = -200 nC
* q4 = 200 nC

The side length of the square is 'a' = 5.0 cm. We need to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.

## Solution:

1. **Identify the forces acting on particle 3:** Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to the other three particles (q1, q2, and q4).

2. **Calculate the force due to each particle:** We'll use Coulomb's Law to calculate the force between each pair of particles. Coulomb's Law states:

   * **F = k * |q1 * q2| / r²** 

   Where:
    * F is the electrostatic force
    * k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²)
    * q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges
    * r is the distance between the charges

   * **Force due to q1:**
      * The distance between q1 and q3 is 'a'.
      * The force is attractive (opposite charges) and acts along the diagonal of the square.
      * We need to find the x-component of this force, which is F1x = F1 * cos(45°) = (k * |q1 * q3| / a²) * cos(45°)

   * **Force due to q2:**
      * The distance between q2 and q3 is 'a√2'.
      * The force is repulsive (same charges) and acts horizontally to the right.
      * The x-component of this force is F2x = F2 = k * |q2 * q3| / (a√2)²

   * **Force due to q4:**
      * The distance between q4 and q3 is 'a'.
      * The force is repulsive (same charges) and acts vertically upwards.
      * The x-component of this force is F4x = 0 (since the force is vertical).

3. **Sum the x-components of the forces:** The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of the individual forces:

   * Fnetx = F1x + F2x + F4x

4. **Substitute the values and calculate:**

   * Fnetx = (k * |q1 * q3| / a²) * cos(45°) + k * |q2 * q3| / (a√2)² + 0
   * Fnetx = (8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²) * (100 x 10^-9 C * 200 x 10^-9 C / (0.05 m)²) * cos(45°) + (8.99 x 10^9 N m²/C²) * (100 x 10^-9 C * 200 x 10^-9 C / (0.05 m * √2)²)

## Solution:

1. **Identify the key triangles:**  We can see two right triangles in the diagram: triangle ABC and triangle ABD.  

2. **Use the grid to find the lengths of the sides:**
   * **Triangle ABC:**  We can count the grid squares to find the lengths of the sides: AB = 5, BC = 4.
   * **Triangle ABD:** We know AD is the height we want to find.  We can see that BD is the difference in the x-coordinates of points B and D, which is 3.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Tangents and Radii:**

   * **Tangent Property:** A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means angles OAC and OBD are both right angles.
   * **Equal Tangent Lengths:** Tangent segments drawn from the same external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, OA = OB, AC = CD, and BD = CD.

2. **Identifying Key Shapes:**

   * **Right Triangles:**  Triangles OAC and OBD are right triangles.
   * **Isosceles Triangles:** Triangles PAC and PBD are isosceles triangles because PA = PC and PB = PD.

3. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**

   * **Right Triangles:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the sides of the right triangles OAC and OBD.  Let's say OA = OB = r (the radius of the circle).  Then, by the Pythagorean theorem:
      * AC² = PA² - OA² = 8² - r²
      * BD² = PB² - OB² = 8² - r²

4. **Finding the Perimeter:**

   * **Perimeter of PCD:** The perimeter of triangle PCD is PC + CD + PD.  Since AC = CD and BD = CD, we can write the perimeter as:
      * Perimeter = PC + CD + PD = PA + 2CD + PB = 2PA + 2CD = 2(PA + CD)
   * **Substituting:** We know PA = 8.0.  We can find CD using the fact that AC = CD and the Pythagorean theorem:
      * CD = AC = √(PA² - OA²) = √(8² - r²)

5. **Simplifying the Expression:**

   * **Perimeter:**  Substituting the values we found, the perimeter of triangle PCD is:

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the problem:** We are given a triangle with a point inside it, and we need to find the measure of one of the angles. We are given some information about the angles formed by the lines inside the triangle.

2. **Using angle properties:**

   * **Angle bisector:** Since CD bisects angle ACB, we know that angle ACD equals angle BCD.
   * **Perpendicular lines:** Since BD is perpendicular to CD, we know that angle BDC is 90 degrees.
   * **Angles in a triangle:** The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.

3. **Finding angles:**

   * **Angle BCD:** Since angle DBC is 54 degrees and angle BDC is 90 degrees, we can find angle BCD using the angle sum property of triangle BCD: angle BCD = 180 - 54 - 90 = 36 degrees.
   * **Angle ACD:** Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle ACD = angle BCD = 36 degrees.
   * **Angle ABD:** Since angle A = angle ABD, we know that angle ABD = angle A.
   * **Angle ADB:** Since angle BDC is 90 degrees and angle ABD is angle A, we can find angle ADB using the angle sum property of triangle ABD: angle ADB = 180 - 90 - angle A = 90 - angle A.

4. **Using the angle sum property of triangle ABC:**

   * **Angle ABC:** Since angle ABD is angle A and angle DBC is 54 degrees, we know that angle ABC = angle A + 54 degrees.
   * **Angle ACB:** Since angle ACD is 36 degrees and angle BCD is 36 degrees, we know that angle ACB = 36 + 36 = 72 degrees.

   * The midpoint of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts. Here, E is the midpoint of AD, meaning AE = ED.

2. **Area Relationship:**
   * **Key Principle:** The area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height.
   * **Applying the Principle:**
      * Consider triangle ABE. Its base is AE, and its height is the perpendicular distance from B to AE.
      * Consider triangle ABC. Its base is AC, and its height is the perpendicular distance from B to AC.
      * Notice that the height of both triangles is the same (the perpendicular distance from B to line AD).

3. **Finding the Ratio of Bases:**

## 2. Solution:

**Step 1: Understand the Incenter**

The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  A key property of the incenter is that it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.  This means that the distance from the incenter to each side is the same.

Area of $\triangle JLN$ = (1/2) * $JL$ * $r$ = (1/2) * 16.5 * $r$ = 8.25$r$

**Step 4: Use the Inradius to Find the Area of Smaller Triangles**

Since the incenter is equidistant from all sides, we can also use the inradius to find the areas of the smaller triangles formed by the incenter and the sides of the triangle.  For example, the area of $\triangle JQN$ is:

Area of $\triangle JQN$ = (1/2) * $JQ$ * $r$

Similarly, the areas of $\triangle KLQ$ and $\triangle LQN$ can be found using the inradius and the corresponding sides.

**Step 5: Relate the Areas of the Triangles**

The area of the whole triangle $\triangle JLN$ is equal to the sum of the areas of the smaller triangles:

Area of $\triangle JLN$ = Area of $\triangle JQN$ + Area of $\triangle KLQ$ + Area of $\triangle LQN$

Substituting the formulas from Step 3 and Step 4:

8.25$r$ = (1/2) * $JQ$ * $r$ + (1/2) * $KQ$ * $r$ + (1/2) * $LQ$ * $r$

**Step 6: Simplify and Solve for JQ**

Notice that the inradius $r$ appears in every term of the equation.  We can divide both sides by $r$ to simplify:

8.25 = (1/2) * $JQ$ + (1/2) * $KQ$ + (1/2) * $LQ$

Since $JQ + KQ + LQ = JL = 16.5$, we can substitute to get:

8.25 = (1/2) * 16.5

Solving for $JQ$:

$JQ$ = 16.5 - 8.25 = 8.25

In triangle ABC, the perpendicular bisector of AB intersects AB at point D and BC at point E.  AE is connected. If AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, what is the perimeter of triangle ABC?

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Perpendicular Bisector:** The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line that cuts the segment in half at a 90-degree angle.  This means that AD = DB = 3.

2. **Using the Perimeter Information:** We know the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, which means AC + CE + AE = 13.

3. **Finding AC:** Since AD is a perpendicular bisector, we know that AD = DB = 3.  Therefore, AB = AD + DB = 3 + 3 = 6.  Since AC is a side of triangle ABC, AC = AB = 6.

4. **Finding CE:** We know that AC + CE + AE = 13 and AC = 6.  Therefore, CE + AE = 13 - 6 = 7.

5. **Finding BC:** Since E is on BC, we know that BC = BE + CE.  We also know that BE = AD = 3 (because AD is a perpendicular bisector).  Therefore, BC = BE + CE = 3 + 7 = 10.

In parallelogram ABCD, the angle bisector of ∠ABC intersects AD at point E, and the angle bisector of ∠BCD intersects AD at point F. If AB = 3 and AD = 4, find the length of EF.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.  In this problem, BE bisects ∠ABC, meaning ∠ABE = ∠CBE. Similarly, CF bisects ∠BCD, meaning ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

2. **Using Parallel Lines:** Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB || CD. This means ∠ABE = ∠CDE (alternate interior angles) and ∠CBE = ∠CDF (alternate interior angles).

3. **Combining Information:**  We now have:
    * ∠ABE = ∠CBE (angle bisector)
    * ∠ABE = ∠CDE (alternate interior angles)
    * ∠CBE = ∠CDF (alternate interior angles)

    Therefore, ∠CDE = ∠CDF.

4. **Triangle Properties:**  Since ∠CDE = ∠CDF, triangle CDE is an isosceles triangle with CD = CE.  Similarly, triangle BCF is an isosceles triangle with BC = CF.

5. **Parallelogram Properties:** In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, AB = CD and BC = AD.

6. **Finding EF:**  We know:
    * AB = CD = 3
    * BC = AD = 4
    * CE = CD = 3
    * CF = BC = 4

    Since EF = CE - CF, we can calculate EF:

In the given figure, lines AB and CD intersect at point O.  Line OD bisects angle AOE, and angle BOC is 50 degrees.  We need to find the measure of angle EOB.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Bisectors:**  A bisector divides an angle into two equal parts. Since OD bisects angle AOE, we know that angle AOD is equal to angle DOE.

2. **Angles on a Straight Line:**  Angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle AOD + angle DOE + angle EOB = 180 degrees.

3. **Vertical Angles:**  Vertical angles are opposite angles formed by the intersection of two lines.  Vertical angles are always equal.  Therefore, angle BOC is equal to angle AOD.

4. **Putting it Together:**  We know that angle BOC = 50 degrees, and since it's equal to angle AOD, we have angle AOD = 50 degrees.  Since OD bisects angle AOE, angle DOE is also 50 degrees.

5. **Finding Angle EOB:**  Now we can substitute the values into the equation from step 2: 50 degrees + 50 degrees + angle EOB = 180 degrees.  Simplifying, we get 100 degrees + angle EOB = 180 degrees.

We have a trapezoid ABCD with right angles at A and B. We know the following side lengths: AB = 24, AD = 23, and BC = 16. We need to find the length of side CD.

## Solution:

1. **Visualize the Trapezoid:** Imagine the trapezoid as a rectangle (ABDC) with a right triangle (BCD) attached to its side. This helps us break down the problem into simpler shapes.

2. **Find the Length of BD:** Since ABDC is a rectangle, we know that AD = BC = 23.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BD:

   * **Pythagorean Theorem:** In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. 
   * **Applying the Theorem:** In triangle BCD, BD is the hypotenuse, BC is one leg, and CD is the other leg. So, BD² = BC² + CD².

A square is inscribed in a circle of area 18π square units. Find the length of a side of the square.

## Solution:

1. **Find the radius of the circle:**

   * We know the area of the circle is 18π square units. The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.
   * We can plug in the given area and solve for the radius: 18π = πr²
   * Dividing both sides by π, we get 18 = r².
   * Taking the square root of both sides, we find r = √18 = 3√2.

2. **Relate the radius to the diagonal of the square:**

   * The diagonal of the square passes through the center of the circle and is equal to the diameter of the circle.
   * The diameter is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is 2 * 3√2 = 6√2.

3. **Find the side length of the square:**

   * We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the diagonal of the square (d) to its side length (s): d² = s² + s² = 2s²
   * We know d = 6√2, so (6√2)² = 2s²
   * Simplifying, we get 72 = 2s²

1. **Problem:**  In a circle with center O, quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed.  Given that angle ∠O = 110 degrees, find the measure of angle ∠C.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.**
      * A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. In this case, ∠O is a central angle.
      * An inscribed angle is an angle whose vertex lies on the circle. In this case, ∠C is an inscribed angle.
      * **Key Rule:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.

   * **Step 2: Identify the corresponding central angle for ∠C.**
      * The central angle corresponding to ∠C is the angle formed by the radii connecting the center O to points C and D.  Let's call this angle ∠COD.

   * **Step 3: Apply the rule to find ∠COD.**
      * Since ∠C is an inscribed angle and ∠COD is its corresponding central angle, we know:

## Solution:

1. **Identify key angles:**  We need to find angle AED.  Notice that angle AED is part of triangle AED.  To find angle AED, we need to know the other two angles in triangle AED: angle ADE and angle EAD.

2. **Find angle ADE:**  Since BC is parallel to DE, we know that angle CDE and angle BCD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees).  Therefore, angle CDE = 180 degrees - angle BCD = 180 degrees - 110 degrees = 70 degrees.  Since AB is parallel to CD, we know that angle ADE and angle CDE are alternate interior angles, meaning they are equal.  Therefore, angle ADE = angle CDE = 70 degrees.

In triangle ABC, angle C is a right angle, AB = 13, and AC = 5. D and E are the midpoints of AC and AB respectively. Find the length of DE.

## Solution:

1. **Identify the key relationship:**  We have a right triangle (ABC) and a line segment (DE) connecting the midpoints of two sides. This suggests we can use the Midsegment Theorem.

   * **Midsegment Theorem:** The line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

2. **Apply the Midsegment Theorem:**  Since D and E are midpoints, DE is parallel to BC and half the length of BC.

3. **Find the length of BC:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BC, the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABC.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We have a triangle with some special properties. We need to find the length of one side (AC) using the given information about other sides and angles.

2. **Key Observations:**
   * **Midpoint:** N is the midpoint of BC, meaning BN = NC.
   * **Angle Bisector:** AM bisects angle BAC, meaning angle BAM = angle CAM.
   * **Perpendicular:** BM is perpendicular to AM, creating a right angle at M.

3. **Using the Properties:**
   * **Triangle BMN:** Since BM is perpendicular to AM, triangle BMN is a right triangle. We know MN = 2. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BM:
      * BM² + MN² = BN²
      * BM² + 2² = BN²
      * BM² = BN² - 4

   * **Triangle AMN:**  Since AM bisects angle BAC, we know angle BAM = angle CAM. Also, angle BMA = angle CMA (both are right angles). Therefore, triangles AMB and AMC are similar triangles (they have the same angles).

   * **Similar Triangles:** Similar triangles have proportional sides. This means:
      * AM/BM = AC/BC
      * AM/BM = AC/(2BN)  (Since N is the midpoint of BC)

4. **Solving for AC:**
   * **Combining Equations:** We have two equations with unknowns:
      * BM² = BN² - 4
      * AM/BM = AC/(2BN)
   * **Expressing AM in terms of BM:** From the second equation, we get AM = (AC * BM) / (2BN).
   * **Substituting AM:** Substitute this expression for AM in the first equation:
      * [(AC * BM) / (2BN)]² = BN² - 4
   * **Simplifying:**
      * (AC² * BM²) / (4BN²) = BN² - 4
      * AC² * BM² = 4BN⁴ - 16BN²
   * **Substituting BM²:** Substitute BM² = BN² - 4:
      * AC² * (BN² - 4) = 4BN⁴ - 16BN²
   * **Expanding and Rearranging:**
      * AC² * BN² - 4AC² = 4BN⁴ - 16BN²
      * 4BN⁴ - (AC² + 16)BN² + 4AC² = 0
   * **Quadratic Equation:** This is a quadratic equation in terms of BN². We can solve for BN² using the quadratic formula:
      * BN² = [(AC² + 16) ± √((AC² + 16)² - 4 * 4 * 4AC²)] / (2 * 4)
      * BN² = [(AC² + 16) ± √(AC⁴ - 8AC² + 256)] / 8
   * **Simplifying:**
      * BN² = [(AC² + 16) ± √((AC² - 16)²)] / 8
      * BN² = [(AC² + 16) ± (AC² - 16)] / 8
   * **Two Possible Solutions:**
      * BN² = (AC² + 16 + AC² - 16) / 8 = AC²/4
      * BN² = (AC² + 16 - AC² + 16) / 8 = 4
   * **Choosing the Correct Solution:** Since BN is a length, it must be positive. Therefore, BN² = AC²/4 is the correct solution.
   * **Solving for AC:**
      * BN² = AC²/4
      * AC² = 4BN²
      * AC = 2BN
   * **Using AB and BN:** We know AB = 8 and BN = BC/2. Since N is the midpoint of BC, BC = 2BN. Therefore, BN = AB/2 = 8/2 = 4.

1. **Understanding Cosine:** Cosine is a trigonometric function that relates the angle of a right triangle to the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In our case, we want to find cosA, so we need to identify the adjacent side and the hypotenuse with respect to angle A.

2. **Identifying Sides:**
    * **Hypotenuse (c):** The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right triangle and is opposite the right angle. In this case, c = 50 is the hypotenuse.

In right triangle ABC, angle ACB is a right angle. Point D is the midpoint of AB, and AB = 10. Find the length of CD.

## Solution:

1. **Identify the key relationships:** We have a right triangle, and we know the midpoint of the hypotenuse. This suggests we can use the Midpoint Theorem.

   * **Midpoint Theorem:** The line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

2. **Apply the Midpoint Theorem:** Since D is the midpoint of AB, CD is parallel to BC and half the length of BC.

3. **Find BC:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BC.

   * **Pythagorean Theorem:** In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

   * Applying this to our triangle: AB² = AC² + BC²
   * We know AB = 10, and we need to find BC.  Let's assume AC = x.  Then:
      * 10² = x² + BC²
      * 100 = x² + BC²
      * BC² = 100 - x²
      * BC = √(100 - x²)

4. **Find CD:**  Since CD is half the length of BC:

   * CD = (1/2) * BC
   * CD = (1/2) * √(100 - x²)

## Answer:

The length of CD is (1/2) * √(100 - x²), where x is the length of AC.

In the given diagram, PA and PB are tangents to circle O, with points A and B as the points of tangency. AC is the diameter of circle O. Given that angle P is 50 degrees, find the measure of angle ACB.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Tangents and Radii:**
   * **Tangents:** A tangent line touches a circle at exactly one point.  
   * **Radii:** A radius is a line segment connecting the center of a circle to a point on the circle.
   * **Important Property:**  A radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. This means angles OAB and OBA are both 90 degrees.

2. **Identifying Key Angles:**
   * **Angle AOB:**  Since OA and OB are radii, triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle (OA = OB). Therefore, angles OAB and OBA are equal.
   * **Angle APB:**  Angles APB and AOB are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees) because they form a straight line.

3. **Calculating Angles:**
   * **Angle AOB:**  We know that angles OAB and OBA are 90 degrees each.  Therefore, angle AOB = 180 - 90 - 90 = 0 degrees.
   * **Angle APB:**  Since angle AOB is 0 degrees, angle APB = 180 - 0 = 180 degrees.
   * **Angle PAB and PBA:**  Since angle APB is 180 degrees and angle P is 50 degrees, angles PAB and PBA are equal and each measure (180 - 50) / 2 = 65 degrees.

4. **Finding Angle ACB:**
   * **Angle CAB:**  Angle CAB is equal to angle PAB (65 degrees) because they are alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines (tangent PA and diameter AC).
   * **Angle ACB:**  Angle ACB is the remaining angle in triangle ABC.  Therefore, angle ACB = 180 - 90 - 65 = 25 degrees.

1. **Problem:** A rhombus has one diagonal that is twice as long as the other diagonal. The area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters. Find the lengths of the diagonals.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the properties of a rhombus.** A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length. Its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This means they divide the rhombus into four congruent right-angled triangles.

   * **Step 2: Relate the diagonals to the area.** The area of a rhombus is half the product of its diagonals.  Let's call the shorter diagonal 'd' and the longer diagonal '2d'.  We can write this as:

     Area = (1/2) * d * 2d = d²

   * **Step 3: Use the given area to find the shorter diagonal.** We know the area is 169 square millimeters.  Substituting this into our equation:

     169 = d²

     Taking the square root of both sides:

     d = 13 millimeters

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:** The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between the sides of a right triangle and the areas of the squares built on those sides. This relationship is known as the Pythagorean Theorem.

2. **Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

A circle with radius 2 has points A, B, and C on its circumference. Angle C is 30 degrees. Find the length of chord AB.

## Solution:

1. **Draw a radius from the center O to point C.** This creates an isosceles triangle OAC, where OA and OC are both radii of the circle.

   * **Reasoning:**  We know that all radii of a circle are equal in length.

2. **Since angle C is 30 degrees, and triangle OAC is isosceles, we can find the other two angles.**  The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.  Since angles OAC and OCA are equal, we have:

   * 180° - 30° = 150°
   * 150° / 2 = 75°  (Each of angles OAC and OCA is 75 degrees)

3. **Draw a perpendicular line from O to chord AB, intersecting AB at point D.** This line bisects chord AB and creates two right triangles, OAD and OBD.

   * **Reasoning:** A perpendicular line from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord.

4. **Focus on triangle OAD.** We know angle OAD is 75 degrees (from step 2), and angle ODA is 90 degrees (because it's a right angle).  Therefore, angle AOD is:

   * 180° - 75° - 90° = 15°

5. **We can now use trigonometry to find the length of AD.**  We know the hypotenuse OA is 2 (the radius of the circle), and we know angle AOD is 15 degrees.  We can use the sine function:

   * sin(AOD) = AD / OA
   * sin(15°) = AD / 2
   * AD = 2 * sin(15°)

6. **Since AD is half the length of AB, we can find AB:**

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Rotation:**  Rotating triangle ABC by 90 degrees clockwise means that each point of the triangle moves 90 degrees in a clockwise direction around point A. This creates a new triangle, AB'C', where:
    * Point B moves to point B'
    * Point C moves to point C'
    * The angles and side lengths of the triangle remain the same, just in a different orientation.

   * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.
   * Since BE bisects angle FBD, we have: ∠FBE = ∠EBD.
   * Similarly, since CE bisects angle ACD, we have: ∠ACE = ∠ECD.

2. **Finding Angle BEC:**
   * We are given that ∠BEC = 35°.

3. **Finding Angle ABE:**
   * Notice that angles ABE and BEC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°).
   * Therefore, ∠ABE = 180° - ∠BEC = 180° - 35° = 145°.

4. **Finding Angle CBE:**
   * Since BE bisects angle FBD, we have ∠FBE = ∠EBD.

**Step 1: Identify the relationship between the angles.**

The angles (4*x* + 11)° and (8*x* + 1)° are **corresponding angles**. Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal line intersects two parallel lines. They occupy the same relative position at each intersection.

**Step 2: Apply the corresponding angles postulate.**

The corresponding angles postulate states that if two lines are parallel, then corresponding angles are congruent (equal).

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Set up an equation.** Since the triangle is isosceles, AB = BC.  We can write this as an equation: 
      9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5

   * **Step 2: Solve for x.**  To solve for x, we need to get all the x terms on one side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other side.  
      * Subtract 5x from both sides: 
         9x - 1 - 5x = 5x - 0.5 - 5x
         4x - 1 = -0.5
      * Add 1 to both sides:
         4x - 1 + 1 = -0.5 + 1
         4x = 0.5
      * Divide both sides by 4:
         4x / 4 = 0.5 / 4
         x = 0.125

   * **Step 3: Find the length of AC.**  We know that AC = 4x + 1.  Substitute the value of x we just found:
      AC = 4(0.125) + 1
      AC = 0.5 + 1
      AC = 1.5

Given a right triangle ABC with right angle at A, three equilateral triangles are constructed outwards on the sides of the triangle: A'BC, AB'C, and ABC'. The areas of triangles A'BC and AB'C are 10 and 4 respectively. Find the area of triangle ABC'.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a right triangle and three equilateral triangles built on its sides. We know the areas of two of the equilateral triangles and need to find the area of the third.

Quadrilateral $ABDC$ is a rectangle. If $m\angle1 = 38$, find $m \angle 2$.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Rectangles:** A rectangle has four right angles. This means that each angle inside the rectangle measures 90 degrees.

2. **Identifying Relevant Angles:**  We are given that $m\angle1 = 38$ degrees.  Notice that $\angle1$ and $\angle2$ are adjacent angles within the rectangle.

In triangle ABC, AD bisects angle BAC and intersects BC at point D. DE is perpendicular to AB, with E as the foot of the perpendicular. Given DE = 3 and AC = 4, find the area of triangle ADC.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a triangle ABC with an angle bisector AD. We need to find the area of triangle ADC, knowing the length of DE and AC.

2. **Using the Angle Bisector Theorem:** The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides. In our case, AD bisects angle BAC, so:

   * BD/DC = AB/AC

3. **Finding AB:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem in right triangle ADE:

   * AD² = DE² + AE²
   * AD² = 3² + AE²

   Since we don't know AE, we can't directly find AD. However, we can use the fact that DE is the altitude of triangle ABC, and therefore:

   * Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * BC * DE
   * Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * (BD + DC) * 3

4. **Relating Areas:** We can express the area of triangle ADC in terms of the area of triangle ABC:

   * Area of triangle ADC = (1/2) * DC * AD

   Since AD is the same for both triangles ADC and ABC, we can write:

   * Area of triangle ADC = (DC/BC) * Area of triangle ABC

5. **Substituting and Solving:** Now we can substitute the values we know and the relationships we derived:

   * Area of triangle ADC = (DC/(BD + DC)) * (1/2) * (BD + DC) * 3
   * Area of triangle ADC = (1/2) * DC * 3
   * Area of triangle ADC = (3/2) * DC

   We still need to find DC. Using the Angle Bisector Theorem and the fact that AC = 4, we can write:

   * BD/DC = AB/AC = AB/4

   Since we don't know AB, we can't directly find DC. However, we can use the fact that the area of triangle ABC can also be expressed as:

   * Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * AB * DE
   * Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * AB * 3

   Combining this with the previous expression for the area of triangle ABC, we get:

   * (1/2) * AB * 3 = (1/2) * (BD + DC) * 3
   * AB = BD + DC

   Substituting this into the Angle Bisector Theorem equation:

   * BD/DC = (BD + DC)/4
   * 4BD = BD² + BD*DC + DC²
   * BD² + (DC - 4) * BD + DC² = 0

   This is a quadratic equation in BD. We can solve for BD using the quadratic formula, but it's easier to notice that BD = DC is a solution. This means that D is the midpoint of BC, and therefore:

   * DC = BC/2

6. **Final Calculation:** Now we can substitute DC = BC/2 into the expression for the area of triangle ADC:

   * Area of triangle ADC = (3/2) * (BC/2)
   * Area of triangle ADC = (3/4) * BC

   Since we don't know BC, we can't find the exact numerical value of the area. However, we have expressed the area of triangle ADC in terms of BC, which is the only unknown value.

The length of the diameter is 24, and the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle are 9 and 12.25.  We need to find the value of *x*, which is the length of one of the sides of the triangle.

## Solution:

1. **Identify the relevant geometric concepts:** This problem involves a circle and a triangle.  We need to use the concept of the **Inscribed Angle Theorem** which states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  We also need to use the **Pythagorean Theorem** which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  The angle formed by the sides of length 9 and 12.25 is an inscribed angle that intercepts the diameter of the circle.  Since the diameter is a semicircle, the intercepted arc is 180 degrees.  Therefore, the inscribed angle is half of 180 degrees, which is 90 degrees.  This means the triangle is a right triangle.

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**  We now know that the triangle is a right triangle, with the hypotenuse being the side of length 12.25.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the value of *x*:

In a circle with center O, points A, B, and C lie on the circumference.  Angle ACB measures 25 degrees.  What is the measure of angle BAO?

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between angles inscribed in a circle and their corresponding central angles.  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords with its vertex on the circle's circumference. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii with its vertex at the center of the circle.

2. **The Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.  In our problem, angle ACB is an inscribed angle, and angle AOB is its corresponding central angle.

3. **Finding the Central Angle:**  Since angle ACB is 25 degrees, according to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, angle AOB is twice that, or 50 degrees (25 degrees * 2 = 50 degrees).

4. **Identifying the Triangle:**  Now, focus on triangle AOB.  We know that angle AOB is 50 degrees.  We also know that OA and OB are radii of the circle, making them equal in length.  This means triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle.

5. **Isosceles Triangle Property:**  In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.  Therefore, angle BAO is equal to angle ABO.

6. **Angle Sum Property:**  The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.  In triangle AOB, we have:
    * Angle AOB = 50 degrees
    * Angle BAO = Angle ABO (let's call this x)

7. **Solving for x:**  Applying the angle sum property:

   * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means angle OCB is a right angle (90 degrees).
   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Since AB is a diameter, arc ACB is a semicircle, and angle ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting this semicircle. Therefore, angle ACB is 90 degrees.

2. **Apply angle properties:**

   * **Triangle Sum Property:** The angles inside any triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle ABC, we know angle A is 25 degrees and angle ACB is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle ABC = 180 - 25 - 90 = 65 degrees.

The problem asks us to find the length of line segment BD in a circle with center B and radius 8, given that the length of chord CE is 13.5.

## 2. Solution:

**Step 1: Visualize the problem**

Imagine a circle with a diameter drawn through the center (point B). This diameter is also a chord of the circle.  The chord CE is not a diameter, but it intersects the diameter at point D.  We are given the length of CE and the radius of the circle, and we need to find the length of BD.

**Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

Since we have a right angle at D, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the sides of the right triangle CDE. The Pythagorean Theorem states:

* **In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.**

In our case:

* Hypotenuse = CE = 13.5
* One leg = CD
* Other leg = DE

Therefore, we can write:

*  CE² = CD² + DE²

**Step 3: Find the length of DE**

Since BD is a radius of the circle and DE is a part of it, we can find DE by subtracting BD from the radius:

* DE = BE - BD

We know BE is a radius, so BE = 8.  We need to find BD.

**Step 4: Use the fact that the diameter bisects the chord**

A diameter of a circle bisects any chord that is perpendicular to it. This means that CD = DE.

**Step 5: Substitute and solve for BD**

Now we can substitute DE = CD into the Pythagorean Theorem equation:

* CE² = CD² + CD²
* 13.5² = 2 * CD²

Solve for CD:

* CD² = 13.5² / 2
* CD = √(13.5² / 2) ≈ 9.55

Since CD = DE, we know DE ≈ 9.55.

Now we can find BD:

* BD = BE - DE
* BD = 8 - 9.55 ≈ -1.55

**Step 6: Interpret the result**

We get a negative value for BD. This means that point D is actually located *above* point B on the diameter.  Since we are looking for the length of BD, we take the absolute value:

* BD ≈ |-1.55| = 1.55

   * **Central angle:**  ∠AOB is a central angle, meaning its measure is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc AB.
   * **Inscribed angle:** ∠ACB is an inscribed angle, meaning its measure is half the measure of the intercepted arc AB.

2. **Find the measure of arc AB:**

   * Since ∠AOB is a central angle and measures 40 degrees, arc AB also measures 40 degrees.

3. **Find the measure of ∠ACB:**

   * ∠ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AB, so its measure is half of arc AB's measure. Therefore, ∠ACB = 40/2 = 20 degrees.

4. **Apply the angle sum property of triangles:**

   * In triangle ACO, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees.  We know ∠ACB = 20 degrees and ∠ACO = ∠OAC (from step 1).  Therefore:

The image shows a triangle ABC with two internal angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O.  Given that angle A is 110 degrees, find the measure of angle BOC.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.  Therefore, angle ABO = angle CBO and angle ACO = angle BCO.

2. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.  Therefore, in triangle ABC: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.

3. **Finding Angles B and C:**  We know ∠A = 110°.  Let's represent ∠B as x and ∠C as y.  Substituting into the equation from step 2: 110° + x + y = 180°.  Solving for x + y, we get x + y = 70°.

4. **Angles in Triangle BOC:**  In triangle BOC, we have: ∠BOC + ∠BCO + ∠CBO = 180°.  Since ∠BCO = y/2 and ∠CBO = x/2, we can substitute: ∠BOC + y/2 + x/2 = 180°.

5. **Solving for ∠BOC:**  Combining like terms, we get ∠BOC + (x + y)/2 = 180°.  From step 3, we know x + y = 70°.  Substituting, we get ∠BOC + 70°/2 = 180°.  Simplifying, we get ∠BOC + 35° = 180°.  Finally, solving for ∠BOC, we get ∠BOC = 180° - 35° = 145°.

## Solution:

1. **Identify Corresponding Angles:**  Notice that ∠1 and ∠B are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal line intersects two parallel lines. They occupy the same relative position at each intersection point.

2. **Corresponding Angles are Equal:** A fundamental rule in geometry states that corresponding angles formed by parallel lines are equal. Therefore, ∠1 = ∠B = 58°.

3. **Angles in a Triangle:** The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180°.  In triangle ABC, we know ∠C = 90° and ∠B = 58°.  Therefore, ∠A = 180° - 90° - 58° = 32°.

4. **Adjacent Angles:** ∠2 and ∠A are adjacent angles, meaning they share a common side and vertex.  The sum of adjacent angles is equal to the straight angle, which is 180°.  Therefore, ∠2 = 180° - ∠A = 180° - 32° = 148°.

In parallelogram ABCD, diagonals AC and BD intersect at point O. Given AC = 12.0, BD = 8.0, and AB = 7.0, find the perimeter of triangle OAB.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Parallelograms:** A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides.  Important properties of parallelograms include:
    * **Diagonals bisect each other:** This means the point where the diagonals intersect (point O in our case) divides each diagonal into two equal segments.
    * **Opposite sides are equal:**  In our parallelogram, AB = CD and AD = BC.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the positions of points M and N on sides BC and CD respectively, that make the perimeter of triangle AMN as small as possible.  This is a classic optimization problem.

2. **Key Insight:**  The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.  Therefore, to minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, we need to make AM and AN as short as possible.

3. **Finding the Optimal Positions:**
    * **AM:**  The shortest distance from point A to line BC is the perpendicular from A to BC.  Therefore, point M should be the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC.
    * **AN:** Similarly, the shortest distance from point A to line CD is the perpendicular from A to CD.  Therefore, point N should be the foot of the perpendicular from A to CD.

4. **Analyzing the Triangle:**
    * Now, we have a right triangle AMN, where AM and AN are the altitudes from A to BC and CD respectively.
    * Since ∠BAD = 120°, and ∠BAM and ∠DAN are both right angles, we have ∠MAN = 120° - 90° - 90° = -60°.  However, angles cannot be negative, so we take the supplementary angle, ∠MAN = 180° - 60° = 120°.

5. **Applying Angle Properties:**
    * In triangle AMN, we know ∠MAN = 120°.
    * The sum of angles in any triangle is 180°.  Therefore, ∠AMN + ∠ANM + ∠MAN = 180°.
    * Substituting ∠MAN = 120°, we get ∠AMN + ∠ANM + 120° = 180°.

Given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees, find the measure of angle E.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Congruence:**  Congruent triangles have the same shape and size. This means their corresponding angles are equal. Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, we know that angle A is equal to angle D, angle B is equal to angle E, and angle C is equal to angle F.

2. **Finding Angle C:**  Since CD bisects angle BCA, it divides angle C into two equal angles. We know that angle A is 22 degrees, and the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle C = 180 - 22 - 22 = 136 degrees.  Since angle C is equal to angle F, angle F is also 136 degrees.

3. **Finding Angle EGF:**  We know that angle CGF is 88 degrees.  Angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle EGF = 180 - 88 = 92 degrees.

4. **Finding Angle E:**  We know that angle F is 136 degrees and angle EGF is 92 degrees.  The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle E = 180 - 136 - 92 = -48 degrees.

5. **Adjusting for Negative Angle:**  Angles are typically measured between 0 and 360 degrees.  A negative angle means we need to add 360 degrees to get the equivalent positive angle. Therefore, angle E = -48 + 360 = 312 degrees.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Symmetry:**  Symmetry means that if you fold the figure along the line of symmetry, the two halves will perfectly overlap. In this case:
    * Folding along MP will make point A coincide with point B.
    * Folding along NQ will make point A coincide with point C.

2. **Angles and Symmetry:**  When you fold along a line of symmetry, corresponding angles on either side of the line are equal.  Therefore:
    * ∠AMP = ∠BMP (due to symmetry about MP)
    * ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ (due to symmetry about NQ)

3. **Angles in a Triangle:** The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180°.  Applying this to triangle ABC:
    * ∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°
    * 110° + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°
    * ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 70°

4. **Combining Information:**  Now, let's look at the angles around point A:
    * ∠BAC = ∠AMP + ∠ANQ + ∠PAQ (angles around a point add up to 360°)
    * 110° = ∠AMP + ∠ANQ + ∠PAQ

5. **Using Symmetry Again:**  We know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP and ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.  Substituting these into the equation from step 4:
    * 110° = ∠BMP + ∠CNQ + ∠PAQ

6. **Final Step:**  Notice that ∠BMP + ∠CNQ is the same as ∠ABC + ∠ACB, which we found to be 70° in step 3.  Therefore:

The other chord, $\overline{KJ}$, intersects the circle at points K and J.  The measure of angle GJH is 83 degrees, and the measure of angle KJH is (2x - 27) degrees.  We are given that $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$ and asked to find the value of x.

## 2. Solution:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**

The problem involves intersecting chords in a circle.  We can use the **Intersecting Chords Theorem** to solve it. This theorem states that if two chords intersect inside a circle, then the measure of each angle formed is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

**Step 2: Apply the theorem to the given information.**

* **Angle GJH:**  Angle GJH intercepts arcs GH and KJ.  We know the measure of angle GJH is 83 degrees.
* **Angle KJH:** Angle KJH intercepts arcs KJ and GH.  We know the measure of angle KJH is (2x - 27) degrees.

**Step 3: Set up an equation using the theorem.**

Since the intercepted arcs are the same for both angles, we can set up an equation using the Intersecting Chords Theorem:

1/2 (arc GH + arc KJ) = 83 degrees
1/2 (arc KJ + arc GH) = (2x - 27) degrees

**Step 4: Simplify the equation.**

Notice that the left sides of both equations are identical.  Therefore, we can set the right sides equal to each other:

83 degrees = (2x - 27) degrees

**Step 5: Solve for x.**

* Add 27 degrees to both sides of the equation: 
   83 degrees + 27 degrees = 2x
* Simplify: 110 degrees = 2x
* Divide both sides by 2: 110 degrees / 2 = x

Find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of an isosceles right triangle with sides of length 'a', where the base of the triangle lies along the x-axis and the vertex opposite the base lies on the y-axis.

2. **Find the area of each strip:** The area of each strip is approximately 'x * dy'.

3. **Express 'x' in terms of 'y':**  Since the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, we can use similar triangles to relate 'x' and 'y'. The ratio of the base to the height of the triangle is 'a/a = 1'.  Therefore, for any horizontal strip at a height 'y', the ratio of its length 'x' to its height 'dy' is also 1. This means 'x = y'.

The image shows an infinite chain of resistors, each with resistance R. We need to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b'.

## Solution:

1. **Simplify the Circuit:**  Imagine removing the rightmost section of the circuit. This leaves us with a smaller circuit that looks identical to the original, except it's one section shorter.

2. **Equivalent Resistance:**  Let's call the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain 'R_total'.  The equivalent resistance of the smaller circuit (after removing one section) is also 'R_total'.

3. **Analyze the Smaller Circuit:**  The smaller circuit consists of three resistors in parallel (R, R, and R_total) connected in series with another resistor (R).

4. **Parallel Resistors:**  The equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel is calculated using the formula: 1/R_parallel = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3...

   * In our case, 1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R_total = 2/R + 1/R_total

5. **Series Resistors:**  The equivalent resistance of resistors in series is simply the sum of their individual resistances.

   * The equivalent resistance of the smaller circuit is R_parallel + R = (2/R + 1/R_total) + R

6. **Solve for R_total:**  Since the smaller circuit is identical to the original, its equivalent resistance is also R_total.  Therefore:

   * R_total = (2/R + 1/R_total) + R

7. **Simplify and Solve:**  Substitute R = 1 and solve the equation for R_total:

   * R_total = (2/1 + 1/R_total) + 1
   * R_total = 3 + 1/R_total
   * R_total^2 = 3R_total + 1

   * Since the area of each square is 9, we need to find the square root of 9 to get the side length.
   * The square root of 9 is 3. Therefore, each side of the square is 3 units long.

2. **Determine the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   * The length of the rectangle is equal to the combined side lengths of the two squares, which is 3 + 3 = 6 units.
   * The width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square, which is 3 units.

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:**
   * The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides.
   * Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
   * Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 3)
   * Perimeter = 2 * 9
   * Perimeter = 18 units

Given that AB is parallel to CD, AF intersects CD at point E, BE is perpendicular to AF, angle B is 65 degrees, find the measure of angle DEF.

## Solution:

1. **Identify key angles:** We need to find the measure of angle DEF.  Notice that angle DEF is part of a larger angle, angle BEF.  We can break down angle BEF into two parts: angle BED and angle DEF.

2. **Find angle BED:** Since BE is perpendicular to AF, angle BEF is a right angle (90 degrees).  We know angle B is 65 degrees.  The angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle BED can be found by:

   * Angle BED = 180 degrees - angle BEF - angle B
   * Angle BED = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 65 degrees
   * Angle BED = 25 degrees

3. **Find angle DEF:**  We know angle BEF is 90 degrees and angle BED is 25 degrees.  Therefore, angle DEF can be found by:

   * Angle DEF = angle BEF - angle BED
   * Angle DEF = 90 degrees - 25 degrees
   * Angle DEF = 65 degrees

4. **Apply parallel line properties:**  We are given that AB is parallel to CD.  When a line intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal.  Angle B and angle DEF are corresponding angles.  Therefore, angle DEF is also 65 degrees.

Find the measure of angle NCL, denoted as  m∠NCL, in the given circle diagram.  We are given that m∠MCN = 60° and m∠RCL = (3x + 5)° and m∠RCN = (x - 1)°.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Angles in a Circle:**  A circle has 360 degrees.  This means that all the angles around the center point (C) of the circle add up to 360°.

2. **Combining Angles:**  We can see that angles NCL, RCL, and RCN together form the entire angle NCM.  Therefore:

   m∠NCL + m∠RCL + m∠RCN = m∠NCM

3. **Substituting Values:**  We know m∠NCM = m∠MCN + m∠NCM = 60° + 60° = 120°.  We also know m∠RCL = (3x + 5)° and m∠RCN = (x - 1)°.  Substituting these values into our equation from step 2:

   m∠NCL + (3x + 5)° + (x - 1)° = 120°

4. **Simplifying the Equation:**  Combining like terms on the left side of the equation:

   m∠NCL + 4x + 4° = 120°

5. **Solving for x:**  To isolate m∠NCL, we need to solve for x.  Subtracting 4° from both sides:

   m∠NCL + 4x = 116°

   Subtracting 4x from both sides:

   m∠NCL = 116° - 4x

6. **Finding m∠NCL:**  We still need to find the value of x.  We can use the fact that m∠RCN + m∠RCL = m∠NCM.  Substituting the given values:

   (x - 1)° + (3x + 5)° = 120°

   Combining like terms:

   4x + 4° = 120°

   Subtracting 4° from both sides:

   4x = 116°

   Dividing both sides by 4:

   x = 29°

   Now that we know x = 29°, we can substitute it back into our equation for m∠NCL:

   m∠NCL = 116° - 4(29°)

   m∠NCL = 116° - 116°

   m∠NCL = 0°

Therefore, the measure of angle NCL, m∠NCL, is **0°**.

1. **Problem:** In the given figure, ABCDEF is a regular hexagon, and point O is its center. We need to find the value of angle x.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understanding Regular Hexagons**
      * A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles.
      * The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is 720 degrees. 
      * Therefore, each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures 720/6 = 120 degrees.

   * **Step 2:  Angles at the Center**
      * Since O is the center of the hexagon, lines drawn from O to each vertex divide the hexagon into six congruent triangles.
      * Each of these triangles is isosceles because two of its sides are radii of the hexagon.
      * The sum of the angles in each triangle is 180 degrees.

   * **Step 3: Finding the Central Angle**
      * Let's focus on triangle ABO.  Angle ABO is 120 degrees (from Step 1).
      * Since triangle ABO is isosceles, angles BAO and ABO are equal.
      * Therefore, each of these angles measures (180 - 120)/2 = 30 degrees.
      * The central angle AOB is the remaining angle in triangle ABO, so it measures 180 - 30 - 30 = 120 degrees.

   * **Step 4:  Finding x**
      * Angle x is the sum of angles AOB and BOE.
      * Since the hexagon is regular, angle BOE is also 120 degrees.
      * Therefore, x = 120 + 120 = 240 degrees.

*  ∠WZG = 20°

## 2. Solution:

**Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**

*  We are given that ∠WXJ = 130°.  Since ∠WXJ and ∠GXJ are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), we can find ∠GXJ:
    * ∠GXJ = 180° - ∠WXJ = 180° - 130° = 50°

*  We are also given that ∠WZG = 20°.  Since ∠WZG and ∠YZG are supplementary angles, we can find ∠YZG:
    * ∠YZG = 180° - ∠WZG = 180° - 20° = 160°

**Step 2: Apply the concept of similar triangles.**

*  The fact that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ tells us that triangle JYZ and triangle JXG are similar triangles.  This means their corresponding angles are equal.

A circle is inscribed within a triangle. The minor arc AC has a degree measure of *x*, and the major arc ADC has a degree measure of *y*.  Angle ABC measures 70 degrees.  Find the value of *x*.

## 2. Solution:

**Step 1: Understand the relationship between angles and arcs.**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In our case, angle ABC intercepts arc ADC.

**Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

* Since angle ABC measures 70 degrees, the intercepted arc ADC (which is the major arc) must measure twice that: 70 degrees * 2 = 140 degrees.

In the given diagram, AB is the diameter of circle O, DB and DC are tangents to the circle at points B and C respectively.  If ∠ACE = 25°, find the measure of ∠D.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Tangents and Radii:**
   * A tangent line touches a circle at exactly one point.
   * A radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. 
   * Therefore, ∠OBC = ∠OCD = 90°.

2. **Angles in a Triangle:**
   * The angles inside any triangle add up to 180°.
   * In triangle OBC, we know ∠OBC = 90° and ∠OCB = 90° - ∠ACE = 90° - 25° = 65°.
   * Therefore, ∠BOC = 180° - 90° - 65° = 25°.

3. **Angles Subtended by a Diameter:**
   * An angle inscribed in a semicircle (an angle whose endpoints lie on the diameter and whose vertex lies on the circle) is always a right angle.
   * Therefore, ∠BAC = 90°.

4. **Angles on a Straight Line:**
   * Angles on a straight line add up to 180°.

737,Find the perimeter of the parallelogram.,78,"##  Problem:

Find the perimeter of the parallelogram shown in the image, where one side is 16 feet, the other side is 23 feet, and the angle between them is 60 degrees.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**  The perimeter of any shape is the total length of all its sides.  We need to find the lengths of all four sides of the parallelogram.

2. **Using Properties of Parallelograms:**  Parallelograms have two pairs of parallel sides.  This means that opposite sides are equal in length.  Therefore, we already know two sides are 16 feet and two sides are 23 feet.

3. **Finding the Missing Side:**  We need to find the length of the side opposite the 23-foot side.  To do this, we can use trigonometry.  

   * **Drawing a Right Triangle:**  Imagine drawing a perpendicular line from the top vertex of the parallelogram to the base. This creates a right triangle inside the parallelogram.  The 23-foot side is the hypotenuse of this triangle, and the 60-degree angle is one of its angles.

   * **Using Sine:**  The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.  In our triangle, the opposite side is the height of the parallelogram, and the hypotenuse is 23 feet.  We can write this as:

      sin(60°) = (height) / 23

   * **Solving for the Height:**  We know that sin(60°) = √3 / 2.  Substituting this into the equation and solving for the height, we get:

      (√3 / 2) = (height) / 23
      height = (√3 / 2) * 23
      height = 23√3 / 2

4. **Finding the Perimeter:**  Now that we know the height of the parallelogram, we can find the length of the missing side.  The missing side is the base of the right triangle we drew.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem:

   * **Pythagorean Theorem:**  In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b):  c² = a² + b²

   * **Applying the Theorem:**  In our triangle, the hypotenuse is 23 feet, one side is the height (23√3 / 2), and the other side is the missing side (let's call it 'x').  We can write this as:

      23² = (23√3 / 2)² + x²

   * **Solving for x:**  Simplifying the equation and solving for x, we get:

      529 = 808.75 + x²
      x² = 529 - 808.75
      x² = -279.75 

      Since we cannot have a negative length, we realize there's an error in our calculations.  The issue is that we cannot directly apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side because the 23-foot side is not the hypotenuse of the right triangle we drew.  It's the hypotenuse of the larger triangle formed by the parallelogram's diagonal.

5. **Correcting the Approach:**  To find the missing side, we need to use the cosine function.  The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.  In our triangle, the adjacent side is the missing side (x), and the hypotenuse is 23 feet.  We can write this as:

      cos(60°) = x / 23

   * **Solving for x:**  We know that cos(60°) = 1/2.  Substituting this into the equation and solving for x, we get:

      (1/2) = x / 23
      x = (1/2) * 23
      x = 23/2

6. **Calculating the Perimeter:**  Now that we know all the side lengths, we can calculate the perimeter:

   Perimeter = 23 feet + 23 feet + 16 feet + 16 feet = 78 feet

The perimeter of the parallelogram is **78 feet**.

* The circumference of a circle is 360 degrees.
