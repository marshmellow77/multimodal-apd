2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric relationships. Since CD is the diameter, angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.  Also, since DE is parallel to OA, angle DOE is equal to angle AOD (alternate interior angles).
    * **Step 2:** Apply the angle sum property of triangles. In triangle COD, we have: ∠COD + ∠CDO + ∠DCO = 180°.
    * **Step 3:** Substitute the known values. We know ∠COD = 180° and ∠CDO = 50°. Therefore, 180° + 50° + ∠DCO = 180°.
    * **Step 4:** Solve for ∠DCO.  ∠DCO = 180° - 180° - 50° = -50°. Since angles cannot be negative, we take the absolute value: ∠DCO = 50°.
    * **Step 5:** Recognize that ∠DCO and ∠C are the same angle. Therefore, ∠C = ∠DCO = 50°.

3. **Answer:** The degree of ∠C is 50°.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1:** Identify the coordinates of points A, B, and C.  
        * From the diagram, we can see that A is at (2, 4), B is at (0, 0), and C is at (4, 1).
    * **Step 2:** Calculate the slope of line BC.
        * The slope of a line passing through points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1).
        * Therefore, the slope of BC is (1 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 1/4.
    * **Step 3:** Determine the slope of line AD.
        * Since AD is perpendicular to BC, the product of their slopes is -1.
        * Therefore, the slope of AD is -4.
    * **Step 4:** Find the equation of line AD.
        * Using the point-slope form of a linear equation (y - y1 = m(x - x1)), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line, we can find the equation of AD.
        * Using point A (2, 4) and the slope of -4, the equation of AD is: y - 4 = -4(x - 2).
        * Simplifying, we get: y = -4x + 12.
    * **Step 5:** Find the coordinates of point D.
        * Point D lies on both line AD and line BC.  We can find the coordinates of D by solving the system of equations formed by the equations of AD and BC.
        * The equation of BC can be found using the point-slope form and the slope of 1/4: y - 0 = (1/4)(x - 0), which simplifies to y = (1/4)x.
        * Solving the system of equations:
            * y = -4x + 12
            * y = (1/4)x
        * Substituting the second equation into the first equation: (1/4)x = -4x + 12
        * Solving for x: (17/4)x = 12, x = 48/17.
        * Substituting the value of x back into the equation y = (1/4)x, we get y = 12/17.
        * Therefore, the coordinates of point D are (48/17, 12/17).
    * **Step 6:** Calculate the length of AD using the distance formula.
        * The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²).
        * Using the coordinates of A (2, 4) and D (48/17, 12/17), the length of AD is: √((48/17 - 2)² + (12/17 - 4)²) = √((14/17)² + (-60/17)²) = √(3796/289) = 2√(949)/17.

      * Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.
      * The angle between a tangent and the radius drawn to the point of tangency is 90 degrees. So, ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90 degrees.

   * **Step 2: Analyze Triangle Properties**
      * Since ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90 degrees, quadrilateral OACB is a rectangle.
      * The diagonals of a rectangle are equal and bisect each other. Therefore, AC = BD and OC = OD.

   * **Step 3: Calculate Perimeter**

    * **Pythagorean Theorem:** In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

3. **Answer:**
    * Let $r$ be the inradius of $\triangle JLN$.
    * Since $Q$ is the incenter, $JQ = r$.
    * To find $r$, we need to find the area and semiperimeter of $\triangle JLN$.

    * The semiperimeter of $\triangle JLN$ is $(JL + JN + LN)/2 = (16.5 + 9 + 13.10)/2 = 19.30$.
    * The area of $\triangle JLN$ is $(1/2) * JN * LN = (1/2) * 9 * 13.10 = 58.95$.
    * Therefore, the inradius $r$ is equal to the area divided by the semiperimeter: $r = 58.95 / 19.30 \approx 3.06$.

    * **Identify the right triangle:** Notice that triangle ABD is a right triangle with right angle at B.
    * **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, AD is the hypotenuse, and AB and BD are the other two sides. So, we have: AD² = AB² + BD²
    * **Solve for BD:** Substitute the given values: 23² = 24² + BD². Simplify: 529 = 576 + BD². Subtract 576 from both sides: -47 = BD². Since the length cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, BD = √47.
    * **Find CD:**  Since BC = 16 and BD = √47, we can find CD by subtracting BD from BC: CD = BC - BD = 16 - √47.

3. **Answer:** The length of segment CD is **16 - √47**.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1:** Find the radius of the circle.
        * The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius.
        * We are given that the area of the circle is $18\pi$ square units.  Substituting into the formula, we get $18\pi = \pi r^2$.
        * Dividing both sides by $\pi$, we get $18 = r^2$.
        * Taking the square root of both sides, we get $r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$ units.
    * **Step 2:** Find the diagonal of the square.
        * The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
        * The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is $2(3\sqrt{2}) = 6\sqrt{2}$ units.
    * **Step 3:** Find the side length of the square.
        * The diagonal of a square divides it into two 45-45-90 right triangles.
        * In a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$ times the length of a leg.
        * Since the diagonal of the square is the hypotenuse of the right triangle, the side length of the square is equal to the diagonal divided by $\sqrt{2}$.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1:**  Recognize that angle ADB is a right angle because it is inscribed in a semicircle (angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle).
    * **Step 2:**  Apply the angle sum property of triangles to triangle ADC: ∠ADC + ∠DAC + ∠ACD = 180°.  Since ∠ADC = 26°, we have ∠DAC + ∠ACD = 154°.
    * **Step 3:**  Recognize that ∠CAB and ∠ACD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°) because they are angles on a straight line. Therefore, ∠CAB = 180° - ∠ACD.
    * **Step 4:**  Substitute the value of ∠ACD from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3: ∠CAB = 180° - (154° - ∠DAC) = 26° + ∠DAC.
    * **Step 5:**  Since ∠DAC and ∠CAB are angles in the same triangle (triangle ABC), they are supplementary angles. Therefore, ∠CAB + ∠DAC = 180°.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1: Draw a diagram.**  (The diagram is already provided)
    * **Step 2: Identify relevant properties.**
        * Since N is the midpoint of BC, BN = NC.
        * Since AM bisects angle BAC, angle BAM = angle MAC.
        * Since BM is perpendicular to AM, angle BMA = 90 degrees.
    * **Step 3: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem.** The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides.  Therefore, AB/AC = BM/MC.
    * **Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem.** In right triangle BMN, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BM: BM² = BN² - MN².
    * **Step 5: Solve for AC.**  Substitute the values we know into the equations from steps 3 and 4, and solve for AC.

3. **Answer:** AC = 12. 

**Detailed Explanation:**

* **Step 4:**  Since BN = BC/2 and BC = AB + AC, we have BN = (AB + AC)/2.  Substituting the known values, BN = (8 + AC)/2.
* **Step 4:** Using the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle BMN, we have BM² = BN² - MN² = ((8 + AC)/2)² - 2².
* **Step 5:**  Substituting the values into the Angle Bisector Theorem equation (AB/AC = BM/MC), we get 8/AC = √(((8 + AC)/2)² - 2²)/MC.  Since we don't know MC, we need to find a way to eliminate it.  Notice that MC = AC - AM.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle AMN to find AM: AM² = AN² - MN² = (AC/2)² - 2².  Therefore, MC = AC - √((AC/2)² - 2²).
* **Step 5:** Substitute this expression for MC into the equation from step 5 and solve for AC.  This will involve some algebraic manipulation and simplification.  The final solution is AC = 12.

   * **Step 3:  Substituting known values.** We know ∠BEC = 35°.  Let's represent ∠BCE as x and ∠CBE as y.  Substituting these values into the equation from Step 2, we get: 35° + x + y = 180°.

   * **Step 4:  Solving for x and y.**  Simplifying the equation from Step 3, we get x + y = 145°.  Since ∠FBE = ∠EBD and ∠ACE = ∠ECD, we can rewrite this equation as: ∠FBE + ∠EBD + ∠ACE + ∠ECD = 145°.

   * **Step 5:  Angle relationships in triangle ABE.**  The angles inside triangle ABE add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, ∠FAB + ∠ABE + ∠BAE = 180°.

   * **Step 6:  Substituting and simplifying.**  We know ∠ABE = ∠FBE + ∠EBD and ∠BAE = ∠ACE + ∠ECD.  Substituting these values into the equation from Step 5, we get: ∠FAB + (∠FBE + ∠EBD) + (∠ACE + ∠ECD) = 180°.  Simplifying, we get ∠FAB + 145° = 180°.

   * **Step 7:  Solving for ∠FAB.**  Subtracting 145° from both sides of the equation from Step 6, we get ∠FAB = 35°.

   * **Step 8:  Finding ∠FAE.**  Since ∠FAB = 35° and ∠FAB + ∠FAE = ∠FBE, we have 35° + ∠FAE = ∠FBE.  Since ∠FBE = ∠EBD, we can rewrite this as 35° + ∠FAE = ∠EBD.  Since ∠EBD + ∠FBE = ∠FBD, we have 35° + ∠FAE + 35° = ∠FBD.  Therefore, ∠FAE = ∠FBD - 70°.

        * In triangle AEC, we have ∠AEC + ∠CAE + ∠ACE = 180°.
        * We know ∠AEC = 105° and ∠ACE = ∠C.
        * Therefore, 105° + ∠CAE + ∠C = 180°.
        * Solving for ∠C, we get ∠C = 180° - 105° - ∠CAE.

    * **Step 4: Find ∠CAE.**
        * In triangle AED, we have ∠AED + ∠DAE + ∠ADE = 180°.
        * We know ∠AED = ∠BED = 105° and ∠ADE = ∠D = 35°.
        * Therefore, 105° + ∠DAE + 35° = 180°.
        * Solving for ∠DAE, we get ∠DAE = 180° - 105° - 35° = 40°.
        * Since ∠CAE and ∠DAE are supplementary angles, ∠CAE = 180° - ∠DAE = 180° - 40° = 140°.

    * **Step 3: Calculate the measure of arc BC.**
        * Since AB is a diameter, arc BC is a semicircle, and its measure is 180°. Therefore, ∠A = (1/2) * 180° = 90°.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric relationships.
        * The angle formed by a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.
        * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * **Step 2:** Apply the relationships to set up an equation.
        * The angle with measure (4x + 50)° is formed by a tangent and a chord, so it is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.
        * The angle with measure 3x° is an inscribed angle, so it is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc.

252,Consider the infinitely long chain of resistors shown below. What is the resistance between terminals a and b if R=1?,0.73,"1. **Problem:** Determine the equivalent resistance between terminals a and b of an infinitely long chain of resistors, each with resistance R = 1.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Simplify the circuit.**  Notice that the circuit is symmetrical. We can simplify it by considering only half of the circuit, from terminal a to the point where the next set of resistors starts. This is because the resistance on the other side of that point will be the same as the resistance we calculate for this half.

   * **Step 2: Identify series and parallel combinations.**  The resistors in the simplified circuit are arranged in a combination of series and parallel connections. The two resistors on the top and bottom are in parallel, and the two resistors on the sides are in series with the parallel combination.

   * **Step 3: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination.** The equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel is given by:
     ```
     1/R_parallel = 1/R1 + 1/R2
     ```
     In this case, R1 = R2 = R = 1, so:
     ```
     1/R_parallel = 1/1 + 1/1 = 2
     ```
     Therefore, R_parallel = 1/2.

   * **Step 4: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the series combination.** The equivalent resistance of resistors in series is simply the sum of their individual resistances:
     ```
     R_series = R1 + R2
     ```
     In this case, R1 = R_parallel = 1/2 and R2 = R = 1, so:
     ```
     R_series = 1/2 + 1 = 3/2
     ```

   * **Step 5: Account for the infinite chain.** The simplified circuit we analyzed represents only half of the infinite chain. Since the resistance on the other side of the point where we cut the circuit is the same, the total resistance between terminals a and b is twice the resistance of the simplified circuit:
     ```
     R_total = 2 * R_series = 2 * (3/2) = 3
