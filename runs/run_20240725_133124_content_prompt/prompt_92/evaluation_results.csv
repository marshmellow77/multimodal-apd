643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand the Properties**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Parallel Lines:** When parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.

**2. Apply the Properties**

* **Angle D:** Since CD is the diameter, ∠D intercepts a semicircle.  Therefore, ∠D is a right angle (90°).
* **Angle AOD:**  ∠D and ∠AOD are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°). So, ∠AOD = 180° - 90° = 90°.
* **Angle AOE:** Since DE || OA, ∠AOE and ∠D are corresponding angles and therefore equal. So, ∠AOE = 50°.
* **Angle COE:** ∠COE is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠AOD. Therefore, ∠COE = ∠AOD = 90°.
* **Angle C:**  ∠C is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as ∠COE. Therefore, ∠C = 1/2 * ∠COE = 1/2 * 90° = 45°.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"The triangle is a right triangle, and we know one angle and one side. We can use the trigonometric ratios to find the length of the hypotenuse, $h$.

The trigonometric ratios are:

* **Sine (sin):**  sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse
* **Cosine (cos):** cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse
* **Tangent (tan):** tan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side

In this case, we know the angle (60°) and the adjacent side (4). We want to find the hypotenuse ($h$). Therefore, we will use the cosine function:

cos(60°) = adjacent side / hypotenuse

cos(60°) = 4 / h

To solve for $h$, we can rearrange the equation:

h = 4 / cos(60°)

We know that cos(60°) = 1/2.  Substituting this value into the equation:

h = 4 / (1/2)

h = 4 * 2

**Step 1: Find the measure of angle COD.**

Angles AOD and COD are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.  We can use the following formula:

∠AOD + ∠COD = 180°

Substituting the given value for ∠AOD, we get:

70° + ∠COD = 180°

Solving for ∠COD:

∠COD = 180° - 70° = 110°

**Step 2: Find the measure of angle BOC.**

Angles COD and BOC are vertical angles, meaning they are equal in measure.  Therefore:

∠BOC = ∠COD = 110°

**Step 3: Find the measure of angle BOE.**

Ray OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts.  We can use the following formula:

∠BOE = ∠BOC / 2

Substituting the value for ∠BOC, we get:

∠BOE = 110° / 2 = 55°

What is the $x$ component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3?",0.17,"The problem asks for the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.  To solve this, we need to consider the forces exerted on particle 3 by each of the other particles.

**Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3**

Particle 3 is attracted to particles 1 and 2, and repelled by particle 4.  We can represent these forces as vectors:

* **F13:** Force exerted by particle 1 on particle 3
* **F23:** Force exerted by particle 2 on particle 3
* **F43:** Force exerted by particle 4 on particle 3

**Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of each force**

We can use Coulomb's Law to calculate the magnitude of each force:

```
F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
```

where:

* F is the magnitude of the electrostatic force
* k is Coulomb's constant (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
* q1 and q2 are the charges of the two particles
* r is the distance between the two particles

Let's calculate the magnitude of each force:

* **F13:** 
    * q1 = -100 nC = -100 × 10^-9 C
    * q3 = -200 nC = -200 × 10^-9 C
    * r = a = 5.0 cm = 0.05 m
    * F13 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * |-100 × 10^-9 C * -200 × 10^-9 C| / (0.05 m)^2 = 0.719 N

* **F23:**
    * q2 = 100 nC = 100 × 10^-9 C
    * q3 = -200 nC = -200 × 10^-9 C
    * r = √(a^2 + a^2) = a√2 = 0.05 m * √2 = 0.0707 m
    * F23 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * |100 × 10^-9 C * -200 × 10^-9 C| / (0.0707 m)^2 = 0.359 N

**Step 3: Determine the x-component of each force**

* **F13:** The x-component of F13 is 0 N because F13 is entirely in the y-direction.
* **F23:** The x-component of F23 is F23 * cos(45°) = 0.359 N * cos(45°) = 0.254 N
* **F43:** The x-component of F43 is 0 N because F43 is entirely in the y-direction.

**Step 4: Calculate the net x-component of the force**

The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of each individual force:

* Fnet_x = F13_x + F23_x + F43_x = 0 N + 0.254 N + 0 N = 0.254 N

**Step 1: Identify the right triangle.**

We can see that triangle ABC is a right triangle, with right angle at D.

**Step 2: Determine the lengths of the legs.**

*  The length of AB is 4 units (counting the grid squares).
*  The length of BC is 3 units (counting the grid squares).

**Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs).

Here's the explanation:

1. **Understanding Tangents**
   - Tangents to a circle from an external point are equal in length. This means PA = PB = 8.0.
   - The tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Therefore, ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°.

2. **Analyzing the Triangles**
   - Consider triangles OAC and OBD. They share a common side (OC = OD, as they are both radii of the circle).
   - We know ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90° and OA = OB (radii of the same circle).
   - Therefore, triangles OAC and OBD are congruent by the Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) congruence theorem.

3. **Finding the Perimeter**
   - Since triangles OAC and OBD are congruent, AC = BD.
   - The perimeter of △PCD is PC + CD + PD.
   - We can rewrite this as (PA - AC) + CD + (PB - BD).
   - Substituting PA = PB = 8.0 and AC = BD, we get (8.0 - AC) + CD + (8.0 - AC).
   - Simplifying, we get 16.0 - 2AC + CD.

4. **Final Answer**
   - Since CD is a tangent to the circle, it is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Therefore, CD is the shortest distance between point C and point D.
   - This means 2AC + CD is greater than or equal to the diameter of the circle.
   - However, the diameter of the circle is less than 16.0.

   - Since CD bisects ∠ACB, we know ∠ACD = ∠BCD.
   - We are also given that BD ⊥ CD, which means ∠BDC = 90°.

2. **Apply angle relationships:**
   - In triangle BCD, the angles add up to 180°. Therefore, ∠BCD = 180° - ∠BDC - ∠DBC = 180° - 90° - 54° = 36°.
   - Since CD bisects ∠ACB, we know ∠ACD = ∠BCD = 36°.

3. **Focus on triangle ABD:**
   - We are given that ∠A = ∠ABD.
   - In triangle ABD, the angles add up to 180°. Therefore, ∠ADB = 180° - ∠A - ∠ABD = 180° - 2∠A (since ∠A = ∠ABD).

4. **Use exterior angle theorem:**
   - ∠ADB is an exterior angle of triangle BCD.  The exterior angle theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.  Therefore, ∠ADB = ∠BCD + ∠DBC = 36° + 54° = 90°.

5. **Solve for ∠A:**
   - We know ∠ADB = 90° and ∠ADB = 180° - 2∠A.  Setting these equal, we get 90° = 180° - 2∠A.

**Step 1: Understand the properties of medians and midpoints.**

* **Median:** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
* **Midpoint:** The midpoint of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts.

**Step 2: Apply the property of medians.**

Since AD is the median of triangle ABC, it divides triangle ABC into two triangles with equal areas: triangle ABD and triangle ACD.

* Since AE = DE and BE = CE, we can substitute to get AB² + BE² = CD² + CE².
* Since AB = CD, we have BE² = CE².
* Therefore, BE = CE.
* Since AF = FC and BF = FD, we have EF = (1/2)BD.
* Since BD is the diagonal of the parallelogram, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BD: BD² = AB² + AD².
* Substituting the given values, we get BD² = 3² + 4² = 25.

We also know that ∠BOC = 50°.

Since ∠AOD and ∠DOE are equal, and they add up to ∠AOE, we can say:

∠AOE = 2 * ∠AOD

We also know that ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 180° (because they are supplementary angles).

Therefore, we can write:

2 * ∠AOD + ∠EOB = 180°

We also know that ∠AOD + ∠BOC = 180° (because they are supplementary angles).

Therefore, we can write:

∠AOD = 180° - ∠BOC = 180° - 50° = 130°

Substituting this value into the equation 2 * ∠AOD + ∠EOB = 180°, we get:

2 * 130° + ∠EOB = 180°

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Solving for ∠EOB, we get:

∠EOB = 180° - 260° = -80°

However, angles cannot be negative. Since ∠EOB is an angle formed by two intersecting lines, it must be positive. Therefore, we can add 360° to the result to get the correct angle:

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

First, we need to find the length of AC. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle ABC.

**Step 1: Find the measure of arc AB.**

Since the central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees, the measure of arc AB is also 90 degrees (Central Angle Theorem).

Since the central angle of arc CD is 50 degrees, the measure of arc CD is also 50 degrees (Central Angle Theorem).

**Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem**

The problem involves a circle, a diameter, and a chord.  The relevant theorem is the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**. This theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

**Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**

* **∠ADC intercepts arc AC.**  Therefore, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem,  m∠ADC = 1/2 * m(arc AC).
* **∠CAB intercepts arc CB.**  Therefore, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, m∠CAB = 1/2 * m(arc CB).

**Step 3:  Recognize the relationship between arcs AC and CB**

Since AB is a diameter, arc ACB is a semicircle, and its measure is 180 degrees.  Therefore:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant angles**

We are given that:

* ∠A = 45°
* ∠C = 110°

We need to find ∠AED.

**Step 2: Use the properties of parallel lines**

Since AB∥CD, we know that:

* ∠A + ∠D = 180° (interior angles on the same side of the transversal)

Therefore, ∠D = 180° - ∠A = 180° - 45° = 135°.

Similarly, since BC∥DE, we know that:

* ∠C + ∠E = 180° (interior angles on the same side of the transversal)

Therefore, ∠E = 180° - ∠C = 180° - 110° = 70°.

**Step 3: Use the angle sum property of triangles**

In triangle AED, we have:

* ∠A + ∠D + ∠AED = 180° (angle sum property of triangles)

**Step 1: Draw a diagram**

Draw a diagram of the triangle ABC with the given information.

**Step 2: Use the angle bisector theorem**

The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that an angle bisector divides a side into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.  In this case, AM bisects angle BAC, so we have:

```
AB/AC = BM/MC

**Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem**

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In this case, triangle BMN is a right triangle, so we have:

```
BM^2 + MN^2 = BN^2

In this case, triangle OAB is a right triangle, with OA as the hypotenuse, AB as one leg, and OB as the other leg.

* **Identifying the Angle Pair:**  ∠1 and ∠2 are **corresponding angles**. Corresponding angles are located in the same relative position at each intersection point of the transversal with the parallel lines.

* Since D is the midpoint of AB, AD = DB = AB/2 = 10/2 = 5.
* Triangle ADC is a right triangle with AC as one leg and CD as the other leg.
* We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find CD.

**Step 3: Solve for CD.**

* Using the Pythagorean theorem: AC² + CD² = AD²

* Now we have two equations with two unknowns (AC and BC):
    * AC² + BC² = 10²
    * BC² + CD² = 5²
* Solving for BC in the second equation: BC² = 5² - CD²
* Substituting this value of BC² into the first equation: AC² + (5² - CD²) = 10²

**Understanding the Geometry**

* **Angles in a Triangle:** The angles inside any triangle add up to 180 degrees.

**Solving the Problem**

1. **Quadrilateral OAPB:**  Since ∠OAP = ∠OBP = 90 degrees, quadrilateral OAPB has two right angles.  The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. Therefore:
   ∠AOB + ∠P = 360° - 90° - 90° = 180°
   ∠AOB = 180° - ∠P = 180° - 50° = 130°

2. **Triangle AOB:**  Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal in length. This makes triangle AOB an isosceles triangle.  In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. Therefore:
   ∠OAB = ∠OBA = (180° - ∠AOB) / 2 = (180° - 130°) / 2 = 25°

3. **Triangle ACB:**  Since AC is a diameter, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle.  An inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle is always a right angle. Therefore:
   ∠ABC = 90°

The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In this case, the hypotenuse is 14, and the other two sides are 8 and A.  So we can write:

2. **Right Triangles:** Each of these triangles is a right triangle because the sides of the square are perpendicular.

3. **Equal Sides:** Since the square has equal sides, the hypotenuses of these triangles (KA, KB, KC, KD) are all radii of the circle and therefore equal.

4. **Central Angle:**  Each central angle (e.g., angle AKB) is formed by two radii of the circle. Since the square is inscribed, each central angle intercepts a quarter of the circle's circumference.

5. **Full Circle:** A full circle has 360 degrees.

6. **Central Angle Measure:** Therefore, each central angle measures 360 degrees / 4 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** The measure of a central angle is **90 degrees**.

**1. Understand the Properties**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Vertical Angles:** Vertical angles are opposite angles formed by the intersection of two lines. They are always equal.

**2. Apply the Properties**

* **Find ∠CED:**  Since ∠AEC and ∠CED are vertical angles, they are equal. Therefore, ∠CED = ∠AEC = 105°.

* **Find ∠CDE:**  ∠CDE and ∠D are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°). Therefore, ∠CDE = 180° - ∠D = 180° - 35° = 145°.

* **Find ∠CEB:**  The angles in triangle CED add up to 180°. Therefore, ∠CEB = 180° - ∠CED - ∠CDE = 180° - 105° - 145° = -70°.  Since angles cannot be negative, we know there's an error in our calculations.  Let's re-examine the problem.

**3. Re-evaluate the Problem**

The problem states that ∠AEC = 105°. However, this is impossible given the other information.  Here's why:

* ∠CED = ∠AEC (vertical angles)
* ∠CDE = 145° (supplementary to ∠D)

If ∠AEC = 105°, then ∠CED = 105° as well.  In triangle CED, the sum of the angles would be 105° + 145° + ∠C = 250° + ∠C. This is greater than 180°, which is impossible for a triangle.

**4. Conclusion**

The problem contains an error. It's impossible for ∠AEC to be 105° given the other information.  We cannot determine the value of ∠C without correcting the problem.

In this case, the two secants are the line segment with length 9 + x and the line segment with length 12.25 + 2x.  The external segments are 9 and 12.25, respectively.  Therefore, we can write the following equation:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Circle:** We have a circle with center O.
* **Inscribed Angle:**  ∠ACB is an inscribed angle of the circle, meaning its vertex (point C) lies on the circle, and its sides are chords of the circle.
* **Central Angle:** ∠AOB is a central angle of the circle, meaning its vertex (point O) is the center of the circle, and its sides are radii of the circle.

**Key Concept: Inscribed Angle Theorem**

The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

**Steps**

1. **Find the measure of arc AB:** Since ∠ACB intercepts arc AB, and we know ∠ACB = 25 degrees, we can use the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
   *  Measure of arc AB = 2 * ∠ACB = 2 * 25 degrees = 50 degrees

2. **Find the measure of ∠AOB:**  ∠AOB is the central angle that intercepts arc AB.  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc:
   * Measure of ∠AOB = Measure of arc AB = 50 degrees

3. **Find the measure of ∠BAO:**  Triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle because OA and OB are radii of the circle.  Therefore, ∠BAO and ∠ABO are congruent.  The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees:
   * ∠BAO + ∠ABO + ∠AOB = 180 degrees
   * ∠BAO + ∠BAO + 50 degrees = 180 degrees

* We are given that ∠A = 25°.
* We know that ∠BCO is a right angle because a tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
* We need to find ∠D.

**Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, ∠A intercepts arc BC. Since AB is a diameter, arc BC is a semicircle, and its measure is 180°. Therefore:

∠A = (1/2) * arc BC = (1/2) * 180° = 90°

**Step 3: Apply the Angle Sum Property of Triangles.**

The Angle Sum Property of Triangles states that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180°. In triangle ABC:

∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°

We know ∠A = 90° and ∠C = 90° (because ∠BCO is a right angle). Substituting these values:

90° + ∠B + 90° = 180°

Solving for ∠B:

∠B = 180° - 90° - 90° = 0°

**Step 4: Apply the Exterior Angle Theorem.**

The Exterior Angle Theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. In triangle BCD, ∠D is an exterior angle, and ∠B and ∠C are the non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore:

∠D = ∠B + ∠C

   Triangle OBC is isosceles because OB = OC (radii of the same circle).  Therefore, ∠OCB = ∠OBC = 40°.

* **Step 3: Find the Angle Sum of Triangle OBC**
   The angles in any triangle add up to 180°.  So, ∠BOC = 180° - ∠OBC - ∠OCB = 180° - 40° - 40° = 100°.

* **Step 4: Find ∠OAC**

Here's how to find it:

1. **Divide the triangle into smaller shapes:** Imagine dividing the triangle into an infinite number of horizontal strips. Each strip has a width of dy and a length of x.

2. **Find the area of each strip:** The area of each strip is dA = x * dy.

3. **Find the mass of each strip:** Since the triangle has uniform areal density, the mass of each strip is dm = ρ * dA = ρ * x * dy, where ρ is the areal density.

4. **Find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip is simply y.

5. **Integrate to find the total mass and the y-coordinate of the center of mass:** The total mass of the triangle is M = ∫dm = ∫ρ * x * dy. The y-coordinate of the center of mass is given by:

   y_cm = (1/M) * ∫y * dm = (1/M) * ∫y * ρ * x * dy

6. **Express x in terms of y:**  Since the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, we can use the equation of the line to express x in terms of y. The equation of the line is y = (-a/a) * x + a, which simplifies to y = -x + a. Solving for x, we get x = a - y.

7. **Substitute x in the integral:** Substitute x = a - y into the integral for y_cm:

   y_cm = (1/M) * ∫y * ρ * (a - y) * dy

8. **Set the limits of integration:** The limits of integration are from y = 0 to y = a.

9. **Evaluate the integral:** Evaluate the integral to find y_cm:

   y_cm = (1/M) * ∫[0,a] y * ρ * (a - y) * dy = (ρ/M) * [a * (y^2)/2 - (y^3)/3] |_[0,a] = (ρ/M) * (a^3/6)

   y_cm = (ρ/M) * (a^3/6) = (ρ/((ρ * a^2)/2)) * (a^3/6) = (2/a^2) * (a^3/6) = **a/3**

3. **Use the angle bisector property:**  Since CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, we have:
∠ACD = ∠BCD

4. **Use the angle sum property of triangles again:**  In triangle ABC, we have:
∠CAB + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°
Substituting the known values, we get:
58° + ∠ABC + 2∠ACD = 180°
Solving for ∠ABC, we get:
∠ABC = 180° - 58° - 2∠ACD = 122° - 2∠ACD

5. **Use the angle sum property of triangles one more time:**  In triangle BFC, we have:
∠BFC + ∠BCF + ∠CBF = 180°
Substituting the known values, we get:
∠BFC + ∠ACD + (122° - 2∠ACD) = 180°
Solving for ∠BFC, we get:
∠BFC = 180° - 122° + ∠ACD = 58° + ∠ACD

6. **Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180°:**  Since ∠ACD and ∠BCD are on a straight line, we have:
∠ACD + ∠BCD = 180°
Since ∠ACD = ∠BCD, we have:
2∠ACD = 180°
Solving for ∠ACD, we get:
∠ACD = 90°

7. **Substitute the value of ∠ACD into the equation for ∠BFC:**
∠BFC = 58° + ∠ACD = 58° + 90° = 148°

Therefore, the measure of angle BFC is **148°**.",False,0,6.268899917602539,935.0
955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"The problem asks for the measure of angle ADE in a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle. Here's how to solve it:

**1. Understanding the Properties of Regular Polygons**

* **Equal Sides and Angles:** A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal.
* **Central Angle:** The central angle of a regular polygon is formed by connecting the center of the polygon to two consecutive vertices. The measure of each central angle is found by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides.

**2. Applying the Properties to the Pentagon**

* **Central Angle of Pentagon:** Since the pentagon has 5 sides, each central angle (like angle AOB) measures 360 degrees / 5 = 72 degrees.

**3. Finding Angle ADE**

* **Triangle AOD:** Triangle AOD is an isosceles triangle because OA and OD are radii of the circle. Therefore, angles OAD and ODA are equal.
* **Sum of Angles in a Triangle:** The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.  So, in triangle AOD: ∠OAD + ∠ODA + ∠AOD = 180 degrees.
* **Solving for Angle ADE:** Since ∠AOD = 72 degrees and ∠OAD = ∠ODA, we can solve for ∠OAD: 2 * ∠OAD + 72 degrees = 180 degrees.  This gives us ∠OAD = 54 degrees.
* **Angle ADE:**  Angle ADE is the sum of angles OAD and ODA: ∠ADE = ∠OAD + ∠ODA = 54 degrees + 54 degrees = 108 degrees.

**Therefore, the measure of angle ADE is 108 degrees.**

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"The angles x and 70 degrees are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. 

x + 70 = 180

We can solve for x by subtracting 70 from both sides:

x = 180 - 70

x = 110

We are told that y is equal to the square of x.

y = x^2

y = 110^2

y = 12100

Therefore, the value of y is **12100**.",False,0,3.726274013519287,460.0
