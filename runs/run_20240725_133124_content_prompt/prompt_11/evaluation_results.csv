643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"**Problem:**  In a circle with center O, CD is the diameter, chord DE is parallel to chord OA, and the measure of angle D is 50 degrees. What is the measure of angle C?

**Solution:**

1. **Identify key relationships:**
   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Parallel Lines:** When parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are congruent.

2. **Apply the theorems:**
   * Since CD is a diameter, angle COD is a central angle and intercepts arc CD, which is a semicircle. Therefore, angle COD measures 180 degrees.
   * Angle D is an inscribed angle intercepting arc CE.  By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of arc CE is twice the measure of angle D, which is 2 * 50 degrees = 100 degrees.
   * Since DE is parallel to OA, angle DOE is a corresponding angle to angle AOD. Therefore, angle DOE also measures 100 degrees.
   * Angle COE is the difference between angle COD and angle DOE, so it measures 180 degrees - 100 degrees = 80 degrees.
   * Angle C is an inscribed angle intercepting arc CE. By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of angle C is half the measure of arc CE, which is 100 degrees / 2 = 50 degrees.

**Answer:** The degree of angle C is 50 degrees.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"**Problem:** Find the length of the hypotenuse, *h*, of a right triangle given one leg is 4 units long and the angle opposite that leg is 60 degrees.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We know the length of the opposite side and we want to find the hypotenuse. The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function: 
   * sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse

2. **Substitute the known values:** We know the angle is 60 degrees and the opposite side is 4 units. Let's substitute these values into the sine function:
   * sin(60°) = 4 / *h*

3. **Solve for *h*:** To isolate *h*, we can multiply both sides of the equation by *h* and then divide both sides by sin(60°):
   * *h* * sin(60°) = 4
   * *h* = 4 / sin(60°)

4. **Calculate the value of sin(60°):** The sine of 60 degrees is √3 / 2.

5. **Substitute the value of sin(60°) and solve:**
   * *h* = 4 / (√3 / 2)
   * *h* = 4 * (2 / √3)
   * *h* = 8 / √3

6. **Rationalize the denominator:** To simplify the answer, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:
   * *h* = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
   * *h* = 8√3 / 3

**Answer:** The length of the hypotenuse, *h*, is **8√3 / 3** units.

The image shows a 4x4 square grid with each small square having a side length of 1. Points A, B, and C are located on the grid points. Line segment AD is perpendicular to line segment BC, and we need to find the length of AD.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the coordinates:**  
   - Point A is at (3, 4)
   - Point B is at (0, 0)
   - Point C is at (4, 1)

2. **Find the slope of BC:**
   - The slope of a line passing through points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
   - Applying this to BC, we get: (1 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 1/4

3. **Find the slope of AD:**
   - Since AD is perpendicular to BC, the product of their slopes is -1.
   - Therefore, the slope of AD is -1 / (1/4) = -4.

4. **Find the equation of AD:**
   - We know the slope of AD is -4 and it passes through point A (3, 4).
   - Using the point-slope form of a linear equation (y - y1 = m(x - x1)), we get:
     - y - 4 = -4(x - 3)
     - y - 4 = -4x + 12

5. **Find the coordinates of D:**
   - Point D lies on both BC and AD.
   - We can find the equation of BC using the same slope formula and point-slope form:
     - y - 0 = (1/4)(x - 0)
     - y = (1/4)x
   - To find the coordinates of D, we need to solve the system of equations:
     - y = -4x + 16
     - y = (1/4)x
   - Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:
     - (1/4)x = -4x + 16
     - (17/4)x = 16
     - x = 64/17
   - Substituting this value of x back into either equation, we get:
     - y = (1/4) * (64/17) = 16/17
   - Therefore, point D is at (64/17, 16/17).

6. **Calculate the length of AD:**
   - Using the distance formula, we can find the distance between points A (3, 4) and D (64/17, 16/17):
     - AD = √[(64/17 - 3)² + (16/17 - 4)²]
     - AD = √[(1/17)² + (52/17)²]
     - AD = √(2704/289)

The problem asks for the perimeter of triangle PCD, given that PA = 8.0 and CD is tangent to circle O.

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding Tangent Properties:**
   - Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.
   - The radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent. This means ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°.

2. **Analyzing the Triangle:**
   - Triangle PCD is formed by the tangents PA and PB, and the tangent CD.
   - Since ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°, we can conclude that quadrilateral OACB is a rectangle.

3. **Finding the Perimeter:**
   - Perimeter of △PCD = PC + CD + PD
   - PC = PA - AC = 8 - AC
   - PD = PB - BD = 8 - BD
   - Since OACB is a rectangle, AC = BD.
   - Therefore, Perimeter of △PCD = (8 - AC) + CD + (8 - BD) = 16 + CD - 2AC.

4. **Using the Tangent Property:**
   - CD is tangent to circle O, and AC and BD are also tangents.

2. **Right Angle:**  BD is perpendicular to CD, so angle BDC is a right angle (90 degrees).
3. **Complementary Angles:**  Angles BDC and BDC are complementary, meaning they add up to 90 degrees. Therefore, angle BDC = 90 - 54 = 36 degrees.
4. **Angle Sum of Triangle:** The angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle BDC, we have: angle DBC + angle BDC + angle BCD = 180 degrees. Substituting the known values, we get: 54 + 36 + angle BCD = 180. Solving for angle BCD, we find angle BCD = 90 degrees.

In the given triangle ABC, AD is the median, and E is the midpoint of AD. The area of triangle ABE is 2. What is the area of triangle ABC?

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding Medians and Midpoints:** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. Since E is the midpoint of AD, line segment AE is half the length of AD.

2. **Area Ratio:**  The area of a triangle is directly proportional to the base and height. When we draw a line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side (like AD), we divide the triangle into two triangles with equal bases and equal heights. Therefore, the two triangles have equal areas.

3. **Applying the Ratio:** Since AE is half the length of AD, the area of triangle ABE is half the area of triangle ABD.

Since $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$, we know that $JQ$ is the angle bisector of $\angle J$.  Therefore, $\angle JQK = \angle JQP$.  Also, since $QK$ and $QP$ are tangents to the inscribed circle, we know that $QK = QP$.  Therefore, $\triangle JQK \cong \triangle JQP$ by SAS.  This means that $JQ$ is the angle bisector of $\angle J$ and also the perpendicular bisector of $KP$.

Let $x = JQ$.  Then $KQ = QP = x$.  Since $KP = KQ + QP$, we have $KP = 2x$.  Also, since $\triangle JKP$ is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $JP$:

$$JP = \sqrt{JK^2 + KP^2} = \sqrt{(16.5)^2 + (2x)^2}$$

Since $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$, we know that $JQ = JN - QN$.  Therefore, $x = 16.5 - QN$.  Also, since $\triangle QNP$ is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $QN$:

$$QN = \sqrt{QP^2 + NP^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (16.5 - x)^2}$$

Now we can substitute this expression for $QN$ into our equation for $x$:

628,如图，在ABCD中，∠ABC的平分线交AD于点E，∠BCD的平分线交AD于点F，若AB＝3，AD＝4，则EF的长是（）,2,"**Problem:** 

In parallelogram ABCD, the angle bisector of ∠ABC intersects AD at point E, and the angle bisector of ∠BCD intersects AD at point F. If AB = 3 and AD = 4, what is the length of EF?

**Solution:**

1. **Draw a diagram:**  Start by drawing a parallelogram ABCD with the angle bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCD intersecting AD at points E and F, respectively.

2. **Use angle properties:** Since AB || CD, we have ∠ABC + ∠BCD = 180°.  Because BE and CF are angle bisectors, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE and ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

3. **Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem:**  In triangle ABE, the angle bisector BE divides side AD into segments AE and ED. The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the sides is equal to the ratio of the corresponding segments: AE/ED = AB/BD.

4. **Find BD:** Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD = 3 and AD = BC = 4.  Using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABD, we can find BD:

   BD² = AB² + AD² - 2(AB)(AD)cos∠BAD
   BD² = 3² + 4² - 2(3)(4)cos∠BAD

   Since we don't know ∠BAD, we can't directly solve for BD. However, we can use the fact that BD is also the diagonal of parallelogram ABCD, and the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Therefore, BD = 2(BE).

5. **Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem again:** In triangle BCF, the angle bisector CF divides side AD into segments AF and FD. Using the Angle Bisector Theorem: AF/FD = BC/BD.

6. **Solve for EF:**  We know AE/ED = AB/BD and AF/FD = BC/BD. Since AB = BC and BD is common, we have AE/ED = AF/FD. This means that E and F divide AD proportionally. Therefore, EF is a segment parallel to BC and AB, and its length is equal to the difference between the lengths of AE and AF.

7. **Calculate AE and AF:**  From the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:

   AE/ED = AB/BD = 3/(2BE)
   AF/FD = BC/BD = 4/(2BE)

   Since AE + ED = AD = 4, we can solve for AE and ED:

   AE = (3/5) * 4 = 12/5
   ED = (2/5) * 4 = 8/5

   Similarly, AF = (4/5) * 4 = 16/5 and FD = (1/5) * 4 = 4/5.

8. **Find EF:**  Finally, EF = AE - AF = (12/5) - (16/5) = -4/5. Since length cannot be negative, we take the absolute value: EF = 4/5.

**Answer:** The length of EF is **4/5**.

1. **Understanding the problem:** We are given that OD bisects ∠AOE, which means it divides the angle into two equal parts. We also know that ∠BOC = 50°. We need to find the measure of ∠EOB.

2. **Using angle relationships:**
   * Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we have ∠AOD = ∠DOE.
   * ∠BOC and ∠EOB are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°).

3. **Setting up an equation:**

   * ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 180° (they are supplementary angles).
   * Substituting the values we know: 2x + 130° = 180°.
   * Solving for x: 2x = 50°, x = 25°.

In triangle ABC, N is the midpoint of BC, AM bisects angle BAC, and BM is perpendicular to AM at point M. If AB = 8 and MN = 2, what is the length of AC?

**Solution:**

1. **Draw a diagram:**  Start by drawing a diagram of the triangle with the given information.

2. **Identify key relationships:**
   * Since N is the midpoint of BC, BN = NC.
   * AM bisects angle BAC, so angle BAM = angle MAC.
   * BM is perpendicular to AM, so angle BMA = 90 degrees.

3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   * In right triangle BMN, we know BM = MN * tan(BAM) (since tan = opposite/adjacent).
   * We also know that BN = BC/2.
   * Using the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle BMN:  BN² = BM² + MN²
   * Substitute the expressions for BM and BN: (BC/2)² = (MN * tan(BAM))² + MN²

4. **Solve for BC:**
   * We know MN = 2.  We need to find tan(BAM).
   * Since AM bisects angle BAC, we can use the angle bisector theorem: AB/AC = BM/MC.
   * We know AB = 8.  We need to find BM and MC.
   * In triangle BMN, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BM: BM² = BN² - MN² = (BC/2)² - 2²
   * In triangle CMN, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find MC: MC² = CN² - MN² = (BC/2)² - 2²
   * Now we can substitute these values into the angle bisector theorem: 8/AC = (√((BC/2)² - 2²))/(√((BC/2)² - 2²))
   * This simplifies to 8/AC = 1, so AC = 8.

5. **Find tan(BAM):**
   * In triangle BMN, we know BM = √((BC/2)² - 2²) = √(4² - 2²) = √12 = 2√3.
   * tan(BAM) = BM/MN = (2√3)/2 = √3.

6. **Substitute values and solve for BC:**

We can write this as:  a² + b² = c² where 'c' is the hypotenuse, and 'a' and 'b' are the other two sides.

3. **Apply the theorem:** In our problem, the hypotenuse is 14, and one of the other sides is 8. We need to find the length of the third side, which is 'A'.  Let's plug the values into the Pythagorean theorem:

   8² + A² = 14²

4. **Solve for A:**
   * 64 + A² = 196
   * A² = 196 - 64
   * A² = 132
   * A = √132 

5. **Calculate the area of square A:**
   * Area of a square = side²
   * Area of square A = A² = (√132)² = 132

The image shows a circle with center O and radius 2. Points A, B, and C lie on the circle. Angle C is 30 degrees. We need to find the length of chord AB.

**Solution:**

1. **Draw a radius from O to point C.** This creates an isosceles triangle OAC, where OA = OC = 2 (radius of the circle).

2. **Angle AOC is twice the measure of angle C.** This is a property of inscribed angles and central angles in a circle. Therefore, angle AOC = 2 * 30 degrees = 60 degrees.

3. **Triangle OAC is an equilateral triangle.** Since two sides are equal (OA = OC) and the angle between them is 60 degrees, all three angles of triangle OAC are 60 degrees, making it equilateral.

4. **Therefore, AC = OA = OC = 2.**

5. **Draw a perpendicular from O to chord AB, intersecting AB at point D.** This creates two right triangles, OAD and OBD.

6. **Angle OAD = angle OBD = 90 degrees.**

7. **Angle AOD = angle BOD = 30 degrees.** This is because angle AOC is 60 degrees, and it is divided into two equal angles by the perpendicular OD.

8. **Triangles OAD and OBD are 30-60-90 triangles.** This is because they have a 90-degree angle and a 30-degree angle.

9. **In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is √3 times the length of the shorter leg.**

10. **In triangle OAD, OA is the hypotenuse (2), and AD is the shorter leg.** Therefore, AD = OA / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1.

11. **In triangle OAD, OD is the longer leg.** Therefore, OD = AD * √3 = 1 * √3 = √3.

12. **Since OD is perpendicular to AB, it bisects AB.** Therefore, AB = 2 * AD = 2 * 1 = 2.

**Answer:** The length of chord AB is 2.

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Rotation:** Rotating triangle ABC by 90 degrees clockwise means that each point in the triangle moves 90 degrees in a clockwise direction around point A. This results in a new triangle, AB'C', where:
    * Angle B'AC' is 90 degrees (since angle BAC is 90 degrees and the rotation preserves angles).
    * Angle AB'C' is equal to angle ABC (again, rotation preserves angles).

2. **Analyzing the Angles:**
    * We know that angle CC'B' is 32 degrees.
    * Since angle B'AC' is 90 degrees, and angle CC'B' is 32 degrees, we can find angle AC'C' using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees:
        * Angle AC'C' = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 32 degrees = 58 degrees.

3. **Finding Angle AC'B':**
    * We know that angle AB'C' is equal to angle ABC. Since triangle ABC is a right triangle, angle ABC is 90 degrees - angle BAC = 90 degrees - 90 degrees = 0 degrees.
    * Therefore, angle AB'C' is also 0 degrees.
    * Finally, we can find angle AC'B' by subtracting angle AB'C' from angle AC'C':
        * Angle AC'B' = angle AC'C' - angle AB'C' = 58 degrees - 0 degrees = 58 degrees.

2. **Using Geometry:**  The diagonal of a square divides the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles.  The ratio of the sides in a 45-45-90 triangle is 1:1:√2.  This means that if the side length of the square is 's', the diagonal (which is also the diameter of the circle) is s√2.

3. **Central Angle:**  A central angle that intercepts a diameter of a circle measures 180 degrees.

**Answer:** The measure of a central angle of circle K is **180 degrees**.

In triangle ABC, AD bisects angle BAC and intersects BC at point D. DE is perpendicular to AB, with E as the foot of the perpendicular. Given DE = 3 and AC = 4, find the area of triangle ADC.

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the problem:** We are given a triangle ABC with an angle bisector AD. We need to find the area of triangle ADC. We know the length of DE and AC.

2. **Using the angle bisector theorem:** The angle bisector theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides. In our case, AD bisects angle BAC, so we have:

   BD/DC = AB/AC

3. **Finding AB:** Since DE is perpendicular to AB, we have a right triangle ADE. We know DE = 3 and AC = 4. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find AE:

   AE² + DE² = AD²
   AE² + 3² = AD²
   AE² = AD² - 9

   Also, we know that AC = AE + EC. Since EC is a part of BC, we can use the angle bisector theorem to find EC:

Let's analyze the given sides:

**Solution:**

1. **Symmetry and Angles:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP. Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, we have ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.

2. **Angle Sum Property:** The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle ABM, we have:
   ∠BAM + ∠ABM + ∠AMB = 180°

3. **Using Symmetry:**  Since ∠AMP = ∠BMP, we can rewrite the above equation as:
   ∠BAM + ∠ABM + 2∠AMP = 180°

4. **Finding ∠AMP:** We know ∠BAC = 110°, and since ∠BAM = ∠BAC / 2 (due to symmetry), we have ∠BAM = 55°.  Substituting this into the equation from step 3:
   55° + ∠ABM + 2∠AMP = 180°
   ∠ABM + 2∠AMP = 125°

5. **Finding ∠ABM:**  Since ∠ABM = ∠ABP (due to symmetry), we can rewrite the equation from step 4 as:
   2∠ABP + 2∠AMP = 125°
   ∠ABP + ∠AMP = 62.5°

6. **Angle Sum in Triangle ABP:**  Applying the angle sum property to triangle ABP:
   ∠ABP + ∠BAP + ∠APB = 180°
   ∠ABP + 55° + ∠APB = 180°
   ∠ABP + ∠APB = 125°

7. **Solving for ∠APB:**  We have two equations:
   ∠ABP + ∠AMP = 62.5°
   ∠ABP + ∠APB = 125°

   Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
   ∠APB - ∠AMP = 62.5°

8. **Finding ∠PAQ:**  Since ∠APB = ∠PAQ + ∠AMP, we can substitute this into the equation from step 7:
   (∠PAQ + ∠AMP) - ∠AMP = 62.5°
   ∠PAQ = 62.5°

**Answer:** The size of ∠PAQ is 62.5°.

512,What is the y coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle of uniform areal density shown in Figure 9-C?,0.24,"**Problem:** Find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of an isosceles right triangle with uniform areal density.

**Solution:**

1. **Divide the triangle into infinitesimally thin horizontal strips:** Imagine slicing the triangle into many thin horizontal strips, each with a width of dy.

2. **Find the area of each strip:** The area of each strip is approximately equal to its length (which varies with y) multiplied by its width (dy).  The length of the strip at a height y is 2(a-y) (since the triangle is isosceles). Therefore, the area of each strip is dA = 2(a-y)dy.

3. **Find the mass of each strip:** Since the triangle has uniform areal density, the mass of each strip is proportional to its area. Let the areal density be σ. Then, the mass of each strip is dm = σdA = σ * 2(a-y)dy.

4. **Find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip:** The center of mass of each strip is located at its midpoint, which is at a distance of y from the x-axis.

5. **Integrate to find the total mass and the y-coordinate of the center of mass:** To find the total mass (M) and the y-coordinate of the center of mass (y_cm), we need to integrate over the entire triangle:

   * **Total mass (M):**
     M = ∫dm = ∫σ * 2(a-y)dy, where the integration is from y = 0 to y = a.
     M = 2σa∫(1 - y/a)dy = 2σa(y - y^2/(2a)) |_0^a = σa^2

   * **y-coordinate of the center of mass (y_cm):**
     y_cm = (1/M)∫y dm = (1/M)∫y * σ * 2(a-y)dy, where the integration is from y = 0 to y = a.
     y_cm = (2σ/M)∫(ay - y^2)dy = (2σ/M)(ay^2/2 - y^3/3) |_0^a = (2σ/M)(a^3/2 - a^3/3) = (2σ/M)(a^3/6)

**Solution:**

1. **Simplify the circuit:**  Notice that the circuit repeats itself. We can isolate a single repeating unit to analyze. This unit consists of three resistors in parallel (R, R, and R) connected in series with another resistor (R).

2. **Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel resistors:** The equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel is given by:

   1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R

   Therefore, R_parallel = R/3.

3. **Calculate the equivalent resistance of the repeating unit:** The equivalent resistance of the repeating unit is the sum of the parallel resistance and the series resistance:

   R_unit = R_parallel + R = R/3 + R = 4R/3

4. **Consider the infinite chain:** The infinite chain can be thought of as the repeating unit connected to another identical repeating unit, and so on.  Let the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain be R_total.

5. **Set up an equation:**  The equivalent resistance of the infinite chain can be expressed as the resistance of one repeating unit plus the resistance of the rest of the infinite chain:

   R_total = R_unit + R_total

6. **Solve for R_total:**

   R_total = (4R/3) + R_total
   0 = 4R/3
   R_total = -4R/3

   This result seems strange, but it's because we've made an assumption that the infinite chain has a finite resistance.  Since the chain is infinite, the resistance is also infinite.

7. **Consider the limiting case:** As the number of repeating units in the chain increases, the equivalent resistance approaches infinity. This is because each additional unit adds a non-zero resistance to the total.

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a circle with four points (L, N, R, and M) on its circumference. These points divide the circle into four sectors. We know the measure of one sector (60°) and the measures of two other sectors are expressed in terms of 'x'. We need to find the measure of angle NCL, which is the angle formed by the lines connecting points N, C, and L.

2. **Key Concept:** The angles around a point add up to 360°. This is because a full circle represents 360°.

3. **Setting up the Equation:** We can write an equation based on the angles around point C:
   
   $m \angle NCL + m \angle RCL + m \angle MCN + m \angle NCL = 360°$

4. **Substituting Values:** We know the following:

   * $m \angle MCN = 60°$
   * $m \angle RCL = (x - 1)°$
   * $m \angle LCN = (3x + 5)°$

   Substituting these values into the equation:

   $(3x + 5)° + (x - 1)° + 60° + m \angle NCL = 360°$

5. **Solving for x:** Combine like terms:

   $4x + 64° + m \angle NCL = 360°$

   Subtract 64° from both sides:

   $4x + m \angle NCL = 296°$

   We cannot solve for $m \angle NCL$ directly yet, but we can solve for 'x'.  Subtract $m \angle NCL$ from both sides:

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding Regular Hexagons:** A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles. 

2. **Interior Angle Formula:** The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees. For a hexagon (n=6), the sum of interior angles is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.

3. **Angle of a Regular Hexagon:** Since all angles in a regular hexagon are equal, each angle measures 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.

4. **Central Angle:**  Angle BOC is a central angle of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is regular, the central angle divides the hexagon into six congruent triangles. Therefore, angle BOC is 360 degrees / 6 = 60 degrees.

If ∠ACE = 25.0, what is the measure of ∠D?

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding Tangent Properties:**  A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. Therefore, ∠OBC = ∠OCD = 90°.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the sides:** The parallelogram has two pairs of equal sides. We know one side is 23 ft long. To find the perimeter, we need to find the length of the other side.

2. **Use trigonometry:** We can use the 60-degree angle and the 23 ft side to find the height of the parallelogram. Since the height is opposite the 60-degree angle and we know the adjacent side (23 ft), we can use the tangent function:

   * tan(60°) = height / 23 ft
   * height = 23 ft * tan(60°)
   * height ≈ 39.84 ft

3. **Find the other side:** The height divides the 16 ft side into two segments. The longer segment is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the height as one leg and the shorter segment as the other leg. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the longer segment:

   * longer segment² = height² + shorter segment²
   * longer segment² = (39.84 ft)² + (23 ft - shorter segment)²

   Since the shorter segment plus the longer segment equals 16 ft, we can substitute (16 ft - longer segment) for the shorter segment:

   * longer segment² = (39.84 ft)² + (23 ft - (16 ft - longer segment))²
   * longer segment² = (39.84 ft)² + (7 ft + longer segment)²

   Solving for the longer segment, we get:

   * longer segment ≈ 14.84 ft

   Therefore, the other side of the parallelogram is 16 ft - 14.84 ft = 1.16 ft.

4. **Calculate the perimeter:** The perimeter of a parallelogram is the sum of all its sides:

   * Perimeter = 23 ft + 23 ft + 1.16 ft + 1.16 ft
   * Perimeter = 48.32 ft

**Answer:** The perimeter of the parallelogram is approximately 48.32 ft.

   * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. Therefore, ∠CTT = 90°.
   * **Angle sum property of a triangle:** The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180°.

3. **Analyze the triangle:** Consider triangle CTD. We know ∠CTT = 90° and ∠CDT = 45° (since ABCD is a square, and diagonal CD bisects ∠BCD).

4. **Calculate the missing angle:** Using the angle sum property of a triangle:
   ∠CTD + ∠CTT + ∠CDT = 180°
   ∠CTD + 90° + 45° = 180°
   ∠CTD = 180° - 90° - 45°
   ∠CTD = 45°

757,Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.,7.2,"**Problem:** Find the length of segment *x* to the nearest tenth.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:** The problem involves a circle and two secants intersecting outside the circle. We can use the **Secant-Secant Theorem** which states:  *When two secants intersect outside a circle, the product of the length of one secant segment and its external segment is equal to the product of the length of the other secant segment and its external segment.*

2. **Apply the theorem:** Let's label the segments:
    *  The length of the entire secant on the left is 15 + 12 = 27.
    *  The length of its external segment is 12.
    *  The length of the entire secant on the right is *x* + 8.
    *  The length of its external segment is 8.

    According to the Secant-Secant Theorem: 27 * 12 = (*x* + 8) * 8

3. **Solve for *x*:**
    *  Simplify the equation: 324 = 8*x + 64
    *  Subtract 64 from both sides: 260 = 8*x
    *  Divide both sides by 8: *x* = 32.5

**Answer:** The length of segment *x* is approximately **32.5**.",False,0,3.3963139057159424,683.0
364,"As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of ⊙O, and points C and D are on ⊙O. If ∠ABD = 50.0, then the degree of ∠BCD is ()",40°,"**Problem:**  In the given circle, AB is the diameter, and points C and D lie on the circle. Given that ∠ABD = 50°, find the measure of ∠BCD.

**Solution:**

1. **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Since AB is a diameter, arc ACB is a semicircle, and its measure is 180°. Therefore, ∠ACB (which intercepts arc ACB) has a measure of 180°/2 = 90°.

2. **Angle Sum Property of Triangles:** The angles inside a triangle add up to 180°. In triangle ABD, we know ∠ABD = 50° and ∠BAD = 90° (since AB is a diameter). Therefore, ∠ADB = 180° - 50° - 90° = 40°.

3. **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Since ∠AOB is a central angle intercepting arc ACB, its measure is 180°.

4. **Angle Addition Postulate:** The measure of a larger angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its smaller adjacent angles.  Therefore, ∠AOD + ∠DOB = ∠AOB.  We know ∠AOB = 180° and ∠AOD = ∠ADB = 40° (from step 2).  So, ∠DOB = 180° - 40° = 140°.

5. **Inscribed Angle Theorem (again):**  ∠BCD intercepts arc BD, and ∠DOB is a central angle intercepting the same arc. Therefore, ∠BCD = 1/2 * ∠DOB = 1/2 * 140° = 70°.

**Answer:** The degree of ∠BCD is **70°.**

* **Solution:**
    * **Understanding the Relationship:**  Arc PQR is a major arc, meaning it's greater than 180 degrees. Arc PQ is a minor arc, meaning it's less than 180 degrees. The two arcs together make up the entire circle.
    * **Circle Property:** The measure of a circle is 360 degrees.
    * **Equation:** We can set up an equation to represent the relationship:  $m \widehat {PQR} + m \widehat {PQ} = 360^\circ$
    * **Substitution:** Substitute the given value of $m \widehat {PQR}$:  $98^\circ + m \widehat {PQ} = 360^\circ$
    * **Solving for  $m \widehat {PQ}$:** Subtract 98 degrees from both sides of the equation: $m \widehat {PQ} = 360^\circ - 98^\circ$
    * **Calculation:**  $m \widehat {PQ} = 262^\circ$

* **Answer:** The measure of arc PQ, $m \widehat {PQ}$, is 262 degrees.

930,如图，F是△ABC的角平分线CD和BE的交点，CG⊥AB于点G．若∠ACG＝32°，则∠BFC的度数是（）,119°,"**Problem:** 

In the given triangle ABC, F is the intersection point of angle bisectors CD and BE. CG is perpendicular to AB at point G. If ∠ACG = 32°, what is the measure of ∠BFC?

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**  Angle bisectors divide an angle into two equal angles. Therefore, ∠ACD = ∠BCD and ∠ABE = ∠CBE.

2. **Using the Perpendicular:** Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know ∠CGA = ∠CGB = 90°.

3. **Finding ∠ACD:**  We know ∠ACG = 32° and ∠CGA = 90°.  The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so:
   ∠ACD = 180° - ∠ACG - ∠CGA = 180° - 32° - 90° = 58°

4. **Finding ∠BCD:** Since CD is an angle bisector, ∠BCD = ∠ACD = 58°.

5. **Finding ∠BFC:**  We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180° in triangle BFC:
   ∠BFC = 180° - ∠BCF - ∠CBF 
   ∠BFC = 180° - 58° - (∠CBE + ∠EBF) 
   ∠BFC = 122° - (∠CBE + ∠EBF)

6. **Using Angle Bisector Property:** Since BE is an angle bisector, ∠CBE = ∠EBF.  Therefore, ∠BFC = 122° - 2∠CBE.

7. **Finding ∠CBE:**  We know ∠ABE = ∠CBE and ∠ABE + ∠CBE + ∠ABC = 180°.  Since we don't have enough information to find ∠ABC, we cannot determine the exact value of ∠CBE.

**Answer:**

We can express the measure of ∠BFC as **122° - 2∠CBE**.  We cannot find a numerical answer without more information about the triangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding Regular Polygons:** A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal. 

2. **Central Angle:** The central angle of a regular polygon is the angle formed by connecting the center of the polygon to two consecutive vertices.  The measure of each central angle in a regular polygon is given by: 
   Central Angle = 360° / number of sides

3. **Calculating the Central Angle:** In a regular pentagon, the central angle is 360° / 5 = 72°. Therefore, ∠AOE = 72°.

4. **Isosceles Triangle:** Triangle AOE is isosceles because OA = OE (radii of the circumcircle).

5. **Base Angles:** In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Therefore, ∠OAE = ∠OEA.

6. **Angle Sum Property:** The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. So, in triangle AOE:
   ∠AOE + ∠OAE + ∠OEA = 180°
   72° + ∠OAE + ∠OAE = 180°
   2∠OAE = 108°
   ∠OAE = 54°

7. **Angle ADE:**  ∠ADE is an exterior angle of triangle AOE. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore:
   ∠ADE = ∠OAE + ∠OEA = 54° + 54° = 108°
