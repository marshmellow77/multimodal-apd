643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. **Problem Statement:** The image shows a circle with center O, diameter CD, and chords DE and OA. Given that DE is parallel to OA and ∠D measures 50 degrees, the problem asks to find the measure of ∠C.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
        * Since DE is parallel to OA, we have ∠D = ∠A (alternate interior angles).
        * ∠D and ∠C are angles in a triangle, so their sum is 180 degrees.
    * **Step 2: Apply the angle relationships to find ∠A.**
        * We know ∠D = 50 degrees, and ∠D = ∠A, therefore ∠A = 50 degrees.
    * **Step 3: Calculate ∠C.**
        * ∠C + ∠D + ∠A = 180 degrees
        * ∠C + 50 degrees + 50 degrees = 180 degrees
        * ∠C = 180 degrees - 100 degrees = 80 degrees

3. **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠C is 80 degrees.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"1. **Problem Statement:** The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees, the side opposite the 60-degree angle having a length of 4, and the hypotenuse having a length of *h*. The problem asks us to find the value of *h*.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We can use the sine function (sin) to relate the angle, the opposite side, and the hypotenuse. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. 
    * **Apply the sine function:**  In this case, we have: sin(60°) = opposite side / hypotenuse = 4 / *h*.
    * **Solve for *h*:** We know that sin(60°) = √3 / 2.  Substituting this value into the equation, we get: √3 / 2 = 4 / *h*.  To solve for *h*, we can cross-multiply: √3 * *h* = 8.  Finally, divide both sides by √3 to isolate *h*: *h* = 8 / √3.
    * **Rationalize the denominator:** To simplify the answer, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by √3: *h* = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3) = 8√3 / 3.

3. **Final Answer:** *h* = 8√3 / 3.

Given that angle ABC is 70 degrees, we need to find the measure of angle AOC.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.** The problem involves an inscribed angle (∠ABC) and a central angle (∠AOC) subtending the same arc (AC).  The theorem that relates these angles states: ""The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle subtending the same arc.""
    * **Step 2: Apply the theorem.**  Since ∠ABC is an inscribed angle and ∠AOC is a central angle subtending the same arc AC, we can use the theorem to find the measure of ∠AOC.
    * **Step 3: Calculate the measure of ∠AOC.**  According to the theorem, ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC. Substituting the given value of ∠ABC = 70 degrees, we get ∠AOC = 2 * 70 degrees = 140 degrees.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles.**
        * We are given that ∠AOD = 70°.
        * Since ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), we can find ∠BOD: ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.
        * Since OE bisects ∠BOC, we know that ∠BOE = ∠COE.
    * **Step 2: Apply the angle addition postulate.**
        * The angle addition postulate states that the measure of a larger angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its smaller adjacent angles. Therefore, ∠BOD = ∠BOE + ∠COE.
        * Since ∠BOE = ∠COE, we can rewrite this as ∠BOD = 2∠BOE.
    * **Step 3: Solve for ∠BOE.**

        * Dividing both sides by 2, we get ∠BOE = 55°.
    * **Step 4: Find ∠AOE.**
        * ∠AOE and ∠BOE are supplementary angles (they form a straight line). Therefore, ∠AOE = 180° - ∠BOE = 180° - 55° = 125°.

The problem involves four charged particles arranged at the corners of a square. The charges are given as: q1 = -q2 = 100 nC, q3 = -q4 = 200 nC. The side length of the square is 'a' = 5.0 cm. The task is to calculate the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the forces acting on particle 3:** Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to particles 1, 2, and 4.

2. **Calculate the force due to particle 1:**
    * **Formula:** F = k * |q1 * q3| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2), q1 and q3 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.
    * **Direction:** Since q1 and q3 have opposite signs, the force is attractive, directed along the diagonal of the square towards particle 1.
    * **x-component:** The x-component of this force is F1x = F * cos(45°) = (k * |q1 * q3| / r^2) * cos(45°).

4. **Calculate the force due to particle 4:**
    * **Formula:** Same as step 2.
    * **Direction:** Since q4 and q3 have the same sign, the force is repulsive, directed along the vertical line towards particle 4.
    * **x-component:** The x-component of this force is F4x = 0, as the force is purely vertical.

5. **Calculate the net x-component of the force:**
    * **Summation:** The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of the individual forces: Fnetx = F1x + F2x + F4x.

6. **Substitute values and solve:**
    * **Convert units:** Convert nC to C (1 nC = 10^-9 C) and cm to m (1 cm = 10^-2 m).

1. **Problem Statement:** The image shows a 4x4 square grid with each small square having a side length of 1 unit. Points A, B, and C are located on grid points, and AD is perpendicular to BC. The problem asks for the length of AD.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1: Identify the coordinates of points A, B, and C.**
        * From the image, we can see that A is at (3, 4), B is at (0, 0), and C is at (4, 1).

    * **Step 2: Calculate the slope of line BC.**
        * The slope of a line passing through points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1).
        * Applying this to points B and C, we get the slope of BC as (1 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 1/4.

    * **Step 3: Calculate the slope of line AD.**
        * Since AD is perpendicular to BC, the product of their slopes is -1.
        * Therefore, the slope of AD is -1 / (1/4) = -4.

    * **Step 4: Determine the equation of line AD.**
        * We know the slope of AD is -4 and it passes through point A (3, 4).
        * Using the point-slope form of a linear equation (y - y1 = m(x - x1)), we get:
            * y - 4 = -4(x - 3)
            * y = -4x + 16

    * **Step 5: Find the coordinates of point D.**
        * Point D lies on both line AD and line BC.
        * We can substitute the equation of line AD (y = -4x + 16) into the equation of line BC (y = (1/4)x) to find the x-coordinate of D:
            * -4x + 16 = (1/4)x
            * -17/4x = -16
            * x = 64/17
        * Substitute this value of x back into the equation of line BC to find the y-coordinate of D:
            * y = (1/4) * (64/17) = 16/17

    * **Step 6: Calculate the length of AD using the distance formula.**
        * The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²).
        * Applying this to points A (3, 4) and D (64/17, 16/17), we get:
            * AD = √((64/17 - 3)² + (16/17 - 4)²)
            * AD = √((1/17)² + (60/17)²)
            * AD = √(3601/289)

1. **Problem Statement:** The image shows a circle with center O, and two tangents PA and PB drawn from an external point P. Points C and D are moving points on PA and PB respectively, such that CD is always tangent to the circle. Given PA = 8.0, we need to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1: Identify key properties.**
        * Since PA and PB are tangents to the circle, we know that OA is perpendicular to PA and OB is perpendicular to PB. This is a fundamental property of tangents to a circle.
        * Also, since CD is tangent to the circle, we know that OC is perpendicular to CD and OD is perpendicular to CD.
    * **Step 2: Analyze the geometry.**
        * Notice that quadrilateral OACD is a cyclic quadrilateral (all four vertices lie on a circle). This is because angles OAC and ODC are both right angles, and the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary.
        * Similarly, quadrilateral OBCD is also a cyclic quadrilateral.
    * **Step 3: Apply the Tangent-Tangent Theorem.**
        * The Tangent-Tangent Theorem states that if two tangents are drawn to a circle from an external point, then the lengths of the segments from the external point to the points of tangency are equal.
        * Therefore, we have AC = AD and BC = BD.
    * **Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of △PCD.**
        * Perimeter of △PCD = PC + CD + PD
        * Since AC = AD and BC = BD, we can rewrite the perimeter as:
            * Perimeter of △PCD = (PA - AC) + CD + (PB - BD)
            * Perimeter of △PCD = PA + PB + CD - (AC + BD)
            * Perimeter of △PCD = PA + PB + CD - (AD + BC)
            * Perimeter of △PCD = PA + PB + CD - (PA + PB)
            * Perimeter of △PCD = CD
    * **Step 5: Determine the length of CD.**
        * Since CD is tangent to the circle, and OC is perpendicular to CD, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle OCD:
            * CD² = OC² + OD²
        * Since OC and OD are radii of the circle, they are equal. Let's denote the radius as r.
            * CD² = r² + r²
            * CD² = 2r²
            * CD = √(2r²)
            * CD = r√2
    * **Step 6: Express the perimeter in terms of PA.**
        * We know that PA = 8.0. Since AC is a tangent to the circle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle OAC:
            * OA² + AC² = PA²
            * r² + AC² = 8²
            * AC² = 64 - r²
            * AC = √(64 - r²)
        * Since AC = AD, we have AD = √(64 - r²)
        * Now, we can express the perimeter of △PCD in terms of PA:
            * Perimeter of △PCD = CD = r√2 = √(2r²)
            * Perimeter of △PCD = √(2(64 - AC²))
            * Perimeter of △PCD = √(2(64 - (√(64 - r²))²))
            * Perimeter of △PCD = √(2(64 - (64 - r²)))
            * Perimeter of △PCD = √(2r²)
            * Perimeter of △PCD = r√2
    * **Step 7: Find the final answer.**
        * We need to find the perimeter of △PCD, which is equal to r√2. However, we don't have the value of the radius r. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the perimeter.

3. **Final Answer:** The perimeter of △PCD is **r√2**, where r is the radius of the circle. We cannot determine the exact numerical value of the perimeter without knowing the radius.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1: Understand the properties of medians.** A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  A key property is that a median divides a triangle into two triangles with equal areas.

    * **Pythagorean Theorem:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $JQ$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
    * **Applying the Theorem:** In triangle $JQP$, we have:
        * $JQ$ (hypotenuse)
        * $QP$ (inradius) = 9 (given)

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1: Identify relevant properties of parallelograms and angle bisectors.**
        * In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel.
        * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.
    * **Step 2: Apply the angle bisector theorem.**
        * The angle bisector theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides.
        * Applying this to triangle ABC, we have AE/EC = AB/BC.
        * Similarly, applying it to triangle BCD, we have DF/FB = DC/BC.
    * **Step 3: Use the fact that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.**
        * Since AB = DC, we can substitute AB for DC in the equation DF/FB = DC/BC.
    * **Step 4: Combine the equations from Step 2 and Step 3.**
        * We now have two equations: AE/EC = AB/BC and DF/FB = AB/BC.
        * Since both equations have AB/BC, we can equate them: AE/EC = DF/FB.
    * **Step 5: Use the fact that AD = AE + EF + FD.**
        * We can rewrite the equation from Step 4 as AE/(AE + EF) = DF/(DF + EF).
        * Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get AE(DF + EF) = DF(AE + EF).
        * Expanding and rearranging, we get AE * EF = DF * EF.
        * Since EF is common to both sides, we can cancel it out, leaving us with AE = DF.
    * **Step 6: Substitute the values of AE and DF in terms of AD.**
        * We know that AE + EF + DF = AD.
        * Since AE = DF, we can rewrite this as 2AE + EF = AD.
        * Substituting AD = 4, we get 2AE + EF = 4.
    * **Step 7: Solve for EF.**
        * Since AE = DF and AE + DF = AD - EF = 4 - EF, we have AE = (4 - EF)/2.

        * Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know ∠AOD = ∠DOE.
    * **Step 2: Apply the concept of vertically opposite angles.**
        * ∠BOC and ∠AOD are vertically opposite angles, so they are equal. Therefore, ∠AOD = ∠BOC = 50°.
    * **Step 3: Apply the concept of angles on a straight line.**
        * Angles AOE and EOB form a linear pair, meaning they add up to 180°.

        * Since the central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees, and arc AB is the sum of arc AC and arc BC, we can find the measure of arc AC by subtracting the measure of arc BC from the measure of arc AB.
        * The central angle of arc CD is 50 degrees, which is also the measure of arc CD.
        * Since arc CD is the sum of arc BC and arc BD, we can find the measure of arc BC by subtracting the measure of arc BD from the measure of arc CD.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1: Identify the relevant geometric properties.**
        * Since points A, B, and C lie on the circle, triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle.
        * The central angle subtended by chord AB is twice the inscribed angle C. Therefore, ∠AOB = 2 * ∠C = 2 * 30° = 60°.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1: Analyze the Rotation:** Rotating triangle ABC 90 degrees clockwise around point A means that angle BAC becomes angle B'AC', and angle ABC becomes angle AB'C'. Since angle BAC is 90 degrees, angle B'AC' is also 90 degrees.

    * **Step 2: Identify Key Angles:** We are given that angle CC'B' is 32 degrees.  We also know that angle B'AC' is 90 degrees.

    * **Step 3: Apply Angle Sum Property:** The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle AB'C', we have:
        * angle AB'C' + angle B'AC' + angle AC'B' = 180 degrees.

    * **Step 4: Substitute and Solve:** We know angle B'AC' = 90 degrees and angle AB'C' = angle ABC (due to rotation). Since angle ABC is a right angle (90 degrees), we can substitute these values into the equation:

    * **Step 6: Apply Complementary Angles:** Since CC' is perpendicular to AB, angle CC'B' and angle AC'B' are complementary angles. This means they add up to 90 degrees. Therefore:

        * Therefore, ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 145°.
    * **Step 3: Utilize angle relationships.**
        * Since ∠BCE = ∠ECD and ∠CBE = ∠EBD, we can rewrite the equation from Step 2 as ∠ECD + ∠EBD = 145°.

        * Since ∠FCA = ∠ACD - ∠ECD = ∠ACD - ∠BCE = ∠ACD - (1/2)∠ACD = (1/2)∠ACD, we can rewrite the equation as ∠FAC + (1/2)∠ACD + ∠CAF = 180°.
        * Therefore, ∠FAC = 180° - (1/2)∠ACD - ∠CAF.
    * **Step 7: Substitute and simplify.**
        * Substituting the value of ∠FAC in the equation for ∠FAE, we get ∠FAE = (180° - (1/2)∠ACD - ∠CAF) + 35°.
        * Simplifying, we get ∠FAE = 215° - (1/2)∠ACD - ∠CAF.

1. **Problem Statement:** The image shows a rhombus ABCD with E and F being the midpoints of sides AB and AD respectively. Given AB = 5 and AC = 6, find the length of EF.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1: Identify relevant properties of a rhombus.**
        * A rhombus has all sides equal. Therefore, AB = BC = CD = DA = 5.
        * The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. This means that AO = OC and BO = OD, and angles AOB, BOC, COD, and DOA are all right angles.
    * **Step 2: Apply the Midpoint Theorem.**
        * The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
        * Applying this to triangle ABD, we have EF || BD and EF = 1/2 BD.
    * **Step 3: Find the length of BD.**
        * Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BD.
        * In right triangle AOB, we have AO = AC/2 = 3 and AB = 5. Therefore, BO = √(AB² - AO²) = √(5² - 3²) = 4.
        * Since BO = OD, we have BD = 2 * BO = 8.

        * Since ∠BAD = 120°, ∠A'BC = ∠ABC = 90° and ∠A'BA = 60°.
        * Similarly, ∠A''DC = ∠ADC = 90° and ∠A''DA = 60°.

        * The triangle has a 30° angle and a right angle (90°).
        * We need to find ∠2.

    * **Step 2: Apply the concept of corresponding angles.**
        * Since l1 and l2 are parallel lines, the angle formed by the triangle and line l2 (76°) is a corresponding angle to the angle formed by the triangle and line l1.
        * Therefore, the angle formed by the triangle and line l1 is also 76°.

    * **Step 3: Use the angle sum property of triangles.**
        * The sum of all angles in a triangle is 180°.
        * In the given triangle, we have: 30° + 90° + 76° + ∠2 = 180°

    * **Step 4: Solve for ∠2.**
        * Combining the terms, we get: 196° + ∠2 = 180°
        * Subtracting 196° from both sides, we get: ∠2 = -16°

3. **Final Answer:** ∠2 = -16°

726,Find x. Assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent.,10,"1. **Problem Statement:** The image shows a circle with two chords intersecting inside the circle. One of the angles formed by the intersection of the chords is labeled (4x + 50) degrees. Another angle formed by the intersection of the chords is labeled 3x degrees. The third angle formed by the intersection of the chords is labeled 30 degrees. We need to find the value of x.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.** The problem involves the angles formed by intersecting chords inside a circle. The relevant theorem is the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**, which states that the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
    * **Step 2: Apply the theorem.** In this case, the angle (4x + 50) degrees is formed by the intersection of the two chords. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are cut off by the two chords. One intercepted arc is the arc that is cut off by the chord that forms the angle (4x + 50) degrees, and the other intercepted arc is the arc that is cut off by the chord that forms the angle 3x degrees.
    * **Step 3: Set up an equation.** According to the Intersecting Chords Theorem, we have:
        (4x + 50) = 1/2 * (arc intercepted by (4x + 50) + arc intercepted by 3x)
    * **Step 4: Use the given information to simplify the equation.** We know that the angle formed by the intersection of the chords is 30 degrees. This angle intercepts the same arc as the angle 3x degrees. Therefore, the arc intercepted by 3x degrees is 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.
    * **Step 5: Solve for x.** Substituting the value of the intercepted arc into the equation from Step 3, we get:
        (4x + 50) = 1/2 * (arc intercepted by (4x + 50) + 60)
        4x + 50 = 1/2 * (arc intercepted by (4x + 50) + 60)
        8x + 100 = arc intercepted by (4x + 50) + 60
        8x + 40 = arc intercepted by (4x + 50)
        Since the angle (4x + 50) intercepts the arc (8x + 40), we can set them equal to each other:
        4x + 50 = 8x + 40

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1: Visualize the Triangle and Center of Mass**
        * The center of mass of a symmetrical object lies along its axis of symmetry. In this case, the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle lies along the line of symmetry that bisects the right angle.
    * **Step 2: Divide the Triangle into Smaller Shapes**
        * Imagine dividing the triangle into infinitesimally small horizontal strips. Each strip can be approximated as a rectangle with a width 'dx' and a length 'x'.
    * **Step 3: Determine the Area of Each Strip**
        * The area of each strip is given by dA = x * dx.
    * **Step 4: Express 'x' in terms of 'y'**
        * The slope of the hypotenuse of the triangle is -1 (since it's a 45-45-90 triangle). Using the equation of a line (y = mx + c), we can write the equation of the hypotenuse as y = -x + a. Solving for 'x', we get x = a - y.
    * **Step 5: Calculate the y-coordinate of the Center of Mass**
        * The y-coordinate of the center of mass (y_cm) is given by the following formula:
            y_cm = (∫y * dA) / (∫dA)
            where the integrals are taken over the entire area of the triangle.
        * Substitute dA = (a - y) * dx and integrate from y = 0 to y = a:
            y_cm = (∫(y * (a - y) * dx) / (∫(a - y) * dx)
            y_cm = (∫(ay - y^2) * dx) / (∫(a - y) * dx)
        * To integrate with respect to 'x', we need to express 'dx' in terms of 'dy'. From the equation x = a - y, we get dx = -dy.
            y_cm = (∫(ay - y^2) * (-dy)) / (∫(a - y) * (-dy))
            y_cm = (∫(y^2 - ay) * dy) / (∫(y - a) * dy)

    * **Step 2:  Represent the equivalent resistance of the infinite chain.** Let 'X' be the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain between points 'a' and 'b'.

    * **Step 3:  Break down the circuit.**  Consider the first three resistors in parallel and the next resistor in series. The equivalent resistance of the first three resistors in parallel is R/3. This is in series with the next resistor, giving a total resistance of R/3 + R = 4R/3.

    * **Step 4:  Relate the equivalent resistance to the repeating pattern.** The remaining infinite chain beyond this first section also has an equivalent resistance of 'X'. Therefore, the entire circuit can be represented as a combination of 4R/3 in series with 'X'.

    * **Step 5:  Set up an equation.** Since the entire circuit is equivalent to 'X', we can write the equation: X = 4R/3 + X.

        * The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees.
        * For a hexagon (n=6), the sum of interior angles is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.
        * Since the hexagon is regular, all its interior angles are equal. Therefore, each interior angle measures 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.
    * **Step 2: Consider triangle ABO.**
        * Triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle because OA and OB are radii of the hexagon.
        * The angle at A (angle ABO) is half the measure of the interior angle of the hexagon, which is 120 degrees / 2 = 60 degrees.

930,如图，F是△ABC的角平分线CD和BE的交点，CG⊥AB于点G．若∠ACG＝32°，则∠BFC的度数是（）,119°,"## Math Problem Analysis

1. **Problem Statement:** The image shows a triangle ABC with an angle bisector CD and another line segment BE intersecting at point F. CG is perpendicular to AB at point G. Given that ∠ACG = 32°, the problem asks to find the measure of ∠BFC.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles.**
        * Since CG is perpendicular to AB, ∠CGA = 90°.
        * We are given ∠ACG = 32°.
        * Using the angle sum property of a triangle (angles in a triangle add up to 180°), we can find ∠CAG: ∠CAG = 180° - ∠CGA - ∠ACG = 180° - 90° - 32° = 58°.

    * **Step 2: Utilize the angle bisector property.**
        * CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, meaning ∠ACD = ∠BCD.
        * Since ∠ACG = 32°, we have ∠ACD = ∠BCD = 32°.

    * **Step 3: Apply the angle sum property again.**
        * In triangle ACF, we know ∠CAF = 58° and ∠ACF = 32°.
        * Therefore, ∠AFC = 180° - ∠CAF - ∠ACF = 180° - 58° - 32° = 90°.

    * **Step 4: Find ∠BFC.**
        * Since ∠AFC = 90°, we have ∠BFC = 180° - ∠AFC = 180° - 90° = 90°.

3. **Final Answer:** ∠BFC = 90°.

955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"1. **Problem Statement:** The image shows a regular pentagon ABCDE inscribed in a circle with center O. The problem asks for the measure of angle ADE.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1: Find the measure of each interior angle of the regular pentagon.**
        * The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees.
        * For a pentagon (n=5), the sum of interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.
        * Since the pentagon is regular, all interior angles are equal. Therefore, each interior angle measures 540 degrees / 5 = 108 degrees.
    * **Step 2: Determine the measure of angle AED.**
        * Triangle AED is isosceles because AE = AD (sides of the regular pentagon).
        * Therefore, angles AED and ADE are equal.
        * The sum of angles in triangle AED is 180 degrees.
        * Angle A is an interior angle of the pentagon, so it measures 108 degrees.
        * Therefore, angle AED = angle ADE = (180 - 108) / 2 = 36 degrees.
    * **Step 3: Calculate the measure of angle ADE.**
        * We already found that angle ADE = 36 degrees.

3. **Final Answer:** The measure of angle ADE is **36 degrees**.

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"1. **Problem Statement:** The problem presents a diagram with two line segments intersecting at a point on line l. One angle is labeled 70 degrees, another is labeled x degrees, and the third is labeled y degrees. We are given that y is equal to the square of x, and we need to find the value of y.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1: Identify the relationship between the angles.** The angles x, y, and 70 degrees form a straight angle, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.
    * **Step 2: Set up an equation.** We can write the equation: x + y + 70 = 180.
    * **Step 3: Substitute y with x^2.** Since we know y = x^2, we can substitute this into the equation: x + x^2 + 70 = 180.
    * **Step 4: Simplify the equation.** Combine like terms: x^2 + x - 110 = 0.
    * **Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation.** Factor the equation: (x + 11)(x - 10) = 0. This gives us two possible solutions: x = -11 or x = 10.
    * **Step 6: Choose the valid solution.** Since angles cannot be negative, we discard x = -11. Therefore, x = 10.
    * **Step 7: Calculate y.** Substitute x = 10 into the equation y = x^2: y = 10^2 = 100.
