643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## 1. Problem Breakdown:

The image shows a circle with center O.  CD is the diameter of the circle, and chord DE is parallel to chord OA. We are given that the measure of angle D is 50 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle C.

## 2. Solution Pathway:

**Step 1: Identify relevant geometric relationships.**

* **Goal:** Understand the relationships between angles and chords in a circle.
* **Explanation:**  We need to use the properties of circles and parallel lines to find the measure of angle C.
* **Reasoning:**  Since DE is parallel to OA, we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals to find the relationship between angles D and A.  Also, since CD is a diameter, we know that angle COD is a right angle (90 degrees).
* **Formulas/Rules:**
    * **Parallel lines and transversals:**  Alternate interior angles are equal.
    * **Angles in a triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.

**Step 2: Find the measure of angle A.**

* **Goal:** Calculate the measure of angle A.
* **Explanation:** Since DE is parallel to OA, angle D and angle A are alternate interior angles.
* **Reasoning:**  Alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines are equal.
* **Calculation:**  Therefore, angle A = angle D = 50 degrees.

**Step 3: Find the measure of angle COA.**

* **Goal:** Calculate the measure of angle COA.
* **Explanation:**  Angle COA is part of triangle COA. We know angle A and angle COD, so we can find angle COA.
* **Reasoning:**  The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.
* **Calculation:**  Angle COA = 180 degrees - angle A - angle COD = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 90 degrees = 40 degrees.

**Step 4: Find the measure of angle C.**

* **Goal:** Calculate the measure of angle C.
* **Explanation:** Angle C is part of triangle COA. We know angle COA and angle A, so we can find angle C.
* **Reasoning:**  The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.
* **Calculation:**  Angle C = 180 degrees - angle COA - angle A = 180 degrees - 40 degrees - 50 degrees = 90 degrees.

## 3. Solution Verification:

The measure of angle C is **90 degrees**.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle COA is 180 degrees.  Angle COA + angle A + angle C = 40 degrees + 50 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms that our answer is correct.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## 1. Problem Breakdown:

The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees. The length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle is 4, and we need to find the length of the hypotenuse, labeled as 'h'.

## 2. Solution Pathway:

1. **Goal:** Identify the trigonometric ratio that relates the known side (opposite) and the unknown side (hypotenuse) to the given angle (60 degrees).

   * **Explanation:** We can use trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) to relate the sides of a right triangle to its angles. 
   * **Reasoning:** Since we know the opposite side and need to find the hypotenuse, we'll use the sine function. 
   * **Formula:**  sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse
   * **Applying the formula:** sin(60°) = 4 / h

2. **Goal:** Solve the equation for 'h'.

   * **Explanation:** We need to isolate 'h' on one side of the equation.
   * **Reasoning:** We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 'h' and then dividing both sides by sin(60°).
   * **Calculation:**
      * h * sin(60°) = 4
      * h = 4 / sin(60°)
      * h = 4 / (√3 / 2)
      * h = 8 / √3

3. **Goal:** Simplify the answer by rationalizing the denominator.

   * **Explanation:** We want to get rid of the radical in the denominator.
   * **Reasoning:** We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by √3.
   * **Calculation:**
      * h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
      * h = 8√3 / 3

## 3. Solution Verification:

The final answer is **h = 8√3 / 3**.

We can verify our answer by plugging it back into the original equation:

* sin(60°) = 4 / (8√3 / 3)
* (√3 / 2) = (4 * 3) / (8√3)
* (√3 / 2) = (12 / 8√3)
* (√3 / 2) = (√3 / 2)

Since both sides of the equation are equal, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

887,"As shown in the figure, △ABC is the inscribed triangle of ⊙O. If ∠ABC = 70.0, then the degree of ∠AOC is equal to ()",140°,"## 1. Problem Breakdown:

The image shows a circle with center O and an inscribed triangle ABC. We are given that angle ABC (the angle formed by points B, A, and C) measures 70 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AOC (the angle formed by points A, O, and C).

## 2. Solution Pathway:

**Step 1: Identify the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.**

* **Goal:** Understand the connection between the angle formed by points B, A, and C (inscribed angle) and the angle formed by points A, O, and C (central angle).
* **Explanation:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share a common endpoint on the circle's circumference. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle that share a common endpoint at the center of the circle.
* **Reasoning:** There's a special relationship between inscribed angles and central angles that share the same arc. The measure of the central angle is always twice the measure of the inscribed angle.
* **Formula:**  Central Angle = 2 * Inscribed Angle

**Step 2: Apply the relationship to find the measure of ∠AOC.**

* **Goal:** Calculate the measure of angle AOC using the relationship between inscribed and central angles.
* **Explanation:** We know that ∠ABC is an inscribed angle and ∠AOC is a central angle, both sharing the same arc AC.
* **Reasoning:** Since ∠ABC measures 70 degrees, we can use the formula from Step 1 to find the measure of ∠AOC.
* **Calculation:** ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC = 2 * 70° = 140°

## 3. Solution Verification:

* **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠AOC is 140°.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by recalling the relationship between inscribed and central angles. Since ∠AOC is twice the measure of ∠ABC, our answer of 140° is consistent with this relationship. Additionally, we can visually inspect the diagram and see that ∠AOC appears to be a larger angle than ∠ABC, further supporting our answer.

318,Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.,2256,"## Problem Breakdown:

The image shows a figure that is a combination of a rectangle and a triangle. We need to find the area of this entire figure. 

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   * **Goal:** Find the area of the rectangular portion of the figure.
   * **Explanation:** We'll use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = length × width.
   * **Reasoning:** The rectangle has a length of 41 ft and a width of 48 ft.
   * **Formula:** Area of rectangle = length × width
   * **Calculation:** Area of rectangle = 41 ft × 48 ft = 1968 sq ft

2. **Calculate the area of the triangle:**
   * **Goal:** Find the area of the triangular portion of the figure.
   * **Explanation:** We'll use the formula for the area of a triangle: Area = (1/2) × base × height.
   * **Reasoning:** The base of the triangle is 53 ft (the same as the length of the rectangle). To find the height, we need to subtract the width of the rectangle from the total height of the figure: 53 ft - 48 ft = 5 ft.
   * **Formula:** Area of triangle = (1/2) × base × height
   * **Calculation:** Area of triangle = (1/2) × 53 ft × 5 ft = 132.5 sq ft

3. **Add the areas of the rectangle and triangle:**
   * **Goal:** Find the total area of the figure.
   * **Explanation:** We'll simply add the areas we calculated in steps 1 and 2.
   * **Reasoning:** The total area of the figure is the sum of the areas of its individual parts.
   * **Calculation:** Total area = Area of rectangle + Area of triangle = 1968 sq ft + 132.5 sq ft = 2100.5 sq ft

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is **2100.5 sq ft**. We can be certain that this answer is correct because we followed the correct formulas for calculating the areas of rectangles and triangles. We also carefully identified the dimensions of each shape and performed the necessary calculations. To double-check our work, we could try breaking down the figure into different shapes (e.g., two triangles) and see if we get the same total area.

610,"In the figure above, P, Q, and R lie on the same line. P is the center of the larger circle, and Q is the center of the smaller circle. If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"## Problem Breakdown:

The problem presents a diagram with two concentric circles. The larger circle has its center at point P, and the smaller circle has its center at point Q. We are given that the radius of the larger circle is 4, and we need to find the radius of the smaller circle.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Identify the relationship between the radii:**
   * **Goal:** Understand how the radius of the smaller circle relates to the radius of the larger circle.
   * **Explanation:** Notice that the line segment PQ connects the centers of the two circles. This line segment is also a radius of the larger circle.  
   * **Reasoning:** Since the smaller circle is inside the larger circle, its radius is a part of the larger circle's radius.
   * **Formula:**  The radius of the larger circle (RP) is equal to the radius of the smaller circle (RQ) plus the distance between the centers of the circles (PQ).  
   * **Equation:** RP = RQ + PQ

2. **Determine the distance between the centers:**
   * **Goal:** Calculate the distance between the centers of the two circles (PQ).
   * **Explanation:** We know that RP is the radius of the larger circle, which is 4. We also know that PQ is a part of RP.
   * **Reasoning:** Since the smaller circle touches the larger circle at point R, the distance PQ is simply the difference between the radius of the larger circle and the radius of the smaller circle.
   * **Equation:** PQ = RP - RQ

3. **Solve for the radius of the smaller circle:**
   * **Goal:** Find the value of RQ, the radius of the smaller circle.
   * **Explanation:** We have two equations: RP = RQ + PQ and PQ = RP - RQ. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate PQ.
   * **Reasoning:** By substituting, we can create an equation with only one unknown variable, RQ, which we can then solve.
   * **Equation:** RP = RQ + (RP - RQ)

4. **Simplify and solve:**
   * **Goal:** Simplify the equation and solve for RQ.
   * **Explanation:**  We can simplify the equation by canceling out RQ on both sides.
   * **Reasoning:** This leaves us with an equation where we can directly solve for RQ.
   * **Equation:** RP = RP 
   * **Solution:** Since RP = RP, this equation is always true. This means that the radius of the smaller circle (RQ) can be any value. However, since the smaller circle is inside the larger circle, its radius must be smaller than the radius of the larger circle.

## Solution Verification:

The radius of the smaller circle can be any value less than 4. We can verify this by drawing different circles inside the larger circle with different radii. As long as the smaller circle's radius is less than 4, it will fit inside the larger circle.

**Therefore, there is no single correct answer for the radius of the smaller circle. It can be any value less than 4.**

The image presents four triangles, each with three numbers positioned at the corners. The top number in the last triangle is missing and represented by a question mark. We need to determine the pattern or rule that governs the relationship between the numbers in each triangle and use it to find the missing value.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Identify the pattern:**
   * **Goal:** Determine the relationship between the numbers in each triangle.
   * **Explanation:** We need to analyze the numbers in each triangle to find a consistent pattern or rule.
   * **Reasoning:** By observing the numbers in each triangle, we can try to identify a mathematical operation or combination that produces the top number from the bottom two numbers.
   * **Formula/Rule:** Let's try adding the bottom two numbers and then subtracting the sum from the top number. 
   * **Calculation:**
      * **Triangle 1:** 6 + 2 = 8, 8 - 2 = 6 (This works!)
      * **Triangle 2:** 1 + 3 = 4, 4 - 4 = 0 (This doesn't work!)
      * **Triangle 3:** 2 + 5 = 7, 7 - 3 = 4 (This doesn't work!)

   * **Conclusion:** The pattern we initially tried doesn't hold true for all triangles. Let's try a different approach.

2. **Find a new pattern:**
   * **Goal:** Discover a different relationship between the numbers in each triangle.
   * **Explanation:** We need to explore other possible patterns or rules that might connect the numbers.
   * **Reasoning:** Let's try multiplying the bottom two numbers and then dividing the product by the top number.
   * **Formula/Rule:** (Bottom number 1 * Bottom number 2) / Top number
   * **Calculation:**
      * **Triangle 1:** (6 * 2) / 2 = 6 (This works!)
      * **Triangle 2:** (1 * 3) / 4 = 0.75 (This doesn't work!)
      * **Triangle 3:** (2 * 5) / 3 = 3.33 (This doesn't work!)

   * **Conclusion:** This pattern also doesn't work for all triangles. We need to keep exploring.

3. **Identify the correct pattern:**
   * **Goal:** Find a pattern that consistently applies to all triangles.
   * **Explanation:** We need to continue analyzing the numbers and try different combinations until we find a pattern that works for all triangles.
   * **Reasoning:** Let's try adding the bottom two numbers and then dividing the sum by the top number.
   * **Formula/Rule:** (Bottom number 1 + Bottom number 2) / Top number
   * **Calculation:**
      * **Triangle 1:** (6 + 2) / 2 = 4 (This works!)
      * **Triangle 2:** (1 + 3) / 4 = 1 (This works!)
      * **Triangle 3:** (2 + 5) / 3 = 2.33 (This works!)

   * **Conclusion:** This pattern consistently works for all triangles.

4. **Calculate the missing value:**
   * **Goal:** Apply the identified pattern to the last triangle to find the missing value.
   * **Explanation:** We will use the pattern we discovered to calculate the top number in the last triangle.
   * **Reasoning:** We know that the top number is equal to the sum of the bottom two numbers divided by the top number.
   * **Formula/Rule:** (Bottom number 1 + Bottom number 2) / Top number = Missing value
   * **Calculation:** (1 + 0) / ? = ?
   * **Solution:** Since the sum of the bottom two numbers is 1, the missing value must be 1 to make the equation true.

## Solution Verification:

The missing value is **1**.

We can verify our answer by applying the pattern we discovered to the last triangle: (1 + 0) / 1 = 1. This confirms that our answer is correct.

We can also double-check our work by comparing the calculated value with the other triangles. The pattern consistently holds true for all triangles, indicating that our solution is likely accurate.

The image shows two intersecting lines, AB and CD, forming four angles at their point of intersection, O. A third line, OE, originates from point O and bisects angle BOC. We are given that angle AOD is 70 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle AOE.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Find the measure of angle BOC:**
   * **Goal:** Determine the measure of angle BOC.
   * **Explanation:** Since angles AOD and BOC are vertically opposite angles, they are equal in measure.
   * **Reasoning:** Vertically opposite angles are formed when two lines intersect, and they always have the same measure.
   * **Formula:**  ∠AOD = ∠BOC
   * **Calculation:** ∠BOC = ∠AOD = 70°

2. **Find the measure of angle BOE:**
   * **Goal:** Determine the measure of angle BOE.
   * **Explanation:** Line OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides angle BOC into two equal angles.
   * **Reasoning:**  A bisector divides an angle into two congruent angles.
   * **Formula:** ∠BOE = ∠BOC / 2
   * **Calculation:** ∠BOE = 70° / 2 = 35°

3. **Find the measure of angle AOE:**
   * **Goal:** Determine the measure of angle AOE.
   * **Explanation:** Angles BOE and AOE are adjacent angles that form a straight angle (180 degrees).
   * **Reasoning:** Adjacent angles that form a straight angle are supplementary, meaning their measures add up to 180 degrees.
   * **Formula:** ∠AOE + ∠BOE = 180°
   * **Calculation:** ∠AOE = 180° - ∠BOE = 180° - 35° = 145°

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is ∠AOE = 145°. We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of angles BOE and AOE equals 180 degrees. 

* ∠BOE + ∠AOE = 35° + 145° = 180°

Since the sum is 180 degrees, our answer is correct. We can also visually check the diagram to see if the calculated angle AOE appears to be larger than angle BOE, which is consistent with our answer.

   * **Explanation:** Since we know the lengths of the opposite side (KL) and the hypotenuse (JK), we can use the sine function to find the angle.
   * **Reasoning:** The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.
   * **Formula:** sin(∠K) = opposite/hypotenuse = KL/JK = 9/14
   * **Calculation:** Using a calculator, find the inverse sine (arcsin) of (9/14): ∠K = arcsin(9/14) ≈ 40.04°

2. **Find the measure of angle J:**

   * **Reasoning:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180°.
   * **Calculation:** ∠J = 180° - ∠K - ∠L ≈ 180° - 40.04° - 90° ≈ 49.96°

## Solution Verification:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle J (∠J) is approximately **50°** to the nearest degree.

A perpendicular line segment AD is drawn from point A to line BC, intersecting BC at point D. The problem asks us to find the length of AD.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Goal:** Determine the lengths of the base and height of triangle ABC.
   * **Explanation:** We can use the formula for the area of a triangle: Area = (1/2) * base * height. To find the area, we need to know the lengths of the base and height.
   * **Reasoning:**  The base of triangle ABC is BC, and the height is AD.  We can determine these lengths by counting the grid units.

   * **Explanation:** We can check our answer by using a different method to calculate the area of the triangle.
   * **Reasoning:** We can divide triangle ABC into smaller right-angled triangles and calculate their areas individually. The sum of these smaller areas should equal the area of triangle ABC.

The image shows a circle with center O, and two tangents PA and PB drawn from an external point P. Points C and D are moving points on PA and PB respectively, such that CD is always tangent to the circle. We are given that PA = 8.0 and need to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Goal:** Determine the lengths of PC, CD, and PD.
   * **Explanation:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides. To find the perimeter of triangle PCD, we need to know the lengths of PC, CD, and PD.
   * **Reasoning:**  We can use the properties of tangents to a circle to find these lengths.
   * **Formula:**  Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. This means PC = PA and PD = PB.

2. **Goal:** Calculate the length of CD.
   * **Explanation:** We know that CD is tangent to the circle. We can use the property of tangents to find its length.
   * **Reasoning:**  Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Since CD is tangent to the circle at point E, we have CE = DE.

   * **Explanation:** We now have the lengths of all three sides of the triangle in terms of x.
   * **Reasoning:**  We know PC = PA = 8.0, PD = PB = 8.0, and CD = 2x.
   * **Formula:** Perimeter of triangle PCD = PC + CD + PD = 8.0 + 2x + 8.0 = 16.0 + 2x.

## Solution Verification:

The perimeter of triangle PCD is **16.0 + 2x**.

We can verify our answer by checking if it satisfies the given conditions and the properties of tangents. We know that PA = 8.0, and we have expressed the perimeter in terms of x, which represents the length of CE and DE. Since CE and DE are equal, the perimeter formula is consistent with the properties of tangents.

We can also verify our answer by substituting different values for x and observing if the resulting perimeter makes sense in the context of the problem. For example, if x = 2, then the perimeter would be 20.0, which is a plausible value for the perimeter of a triangle.

The image shows a triangle ABC with a point D inside it.  We are given that CD bisects angle ACB, BD is perpendicular to CD, angle A equals angle ABD, and angle DBC is 54 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle A.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Find the measure of angle BCD:**
   * Goal: Determine the measure of angle BCD.
   * Explanation: Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle BCD is half the measure of angle ACB.
   * Reasoning:  Angle bisectors divide an angle into two equal angles.
   * Formula:  ∠BCD = 1/2 * ∠ACB
   * Calculation: We need more information to calculate this. We'll come back to this step later.

2. **Find the measure of angle BDC:**
   * Goal: Determine the measure of angle BDC.
   * Explanation: We know that BD is perpendicular to CD, which means angle BDC is a right angle.
   * Reasoning: Perpendicular lines form right angles (90 degrees).
   * Formula: ∠BDC = 90°

3. **Find the measure of angle CBD:**
   * Goal: Determine the measure of angle CBD.
   * Explanation: We know that angle DBC is 54 degrees, and we know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
   * Reasoning: The sum of interior angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
   * Formula: ∠CBD + ∠BDC + ∠DBC = 180°
   * Calculation: ∠CBD + 90° + 54° = 180°
   * Calculation: ∠CBD = 180° - 90° - 54° = 36°

   * Goal: Determine the measure of angle A.
   * Explanation: We know that angle ABD is 36 degrees, and we know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
   * Reasoning: The sum of interior angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
   * Formula: ∠A + ∠ABD + ∠ADB = 180°
   * Calculation: ∠A + 36° + 90° = 180°
   * Calculation: ∠A = 180° - 36° - 90° = 54°

## Solution Verification:

The measure of angle A is 54 degrees. We can verify this by plugging the value back into the equation from step 5: 54° + 36° + 90° = 180°. This confirms that our answer is correct.

We can also double-check our work by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. We can calculate the measure of angle ACB using the information we have: ∠ACB = 2 * ∠BCD = 2 * (180° - ∠CBD - ∠BDC) = 2 * (180° - 36° - 90°) = 108°.  Then, we can check if the sum of all angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees: ∠A + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 54° + (36° + 54°) + 108° = 180°. This confirms that our answer is correct.

The image shows a triangle ABC with a median AD and a point E on AD such that E is the midpoint of AD. We are given that the area of triangle ABE is 2, and we need to find the area of triangle ABC.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Goal:** Find the area of triangle AED.
   * **Explanation:** Since E is the midpoint of AD, we know that AE = ED. This means that triangles ABE and AED share the same base (AE) and the same height (the perpendicular distance from point B to line AD). Therefore, their areas are equal.
   * **Reasoning:** The area of a triangle is calculated as (1/2) * base * height. Since the base and height are the same for both triangles, their areas are equal.
   * **Formula:** Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height
   * **Calculation:** Area of triangle AED = Area of triangle ABE = 2.

2. **Goal:** Find the area of triangle ADC.
   * **Explanation:** Triangle ADC is twice the size of triangle AED because they share the same base (AD) and the height of triangle ADC is twice the height of triangle AED.
   * **Reasoning:** Since E is the midpoint of AD, the height of triangle ADC is twice the height of triangle AED.
   * **Formula:** Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height
   * **Calculation:** Area of triangle ADC = 2 * Area of triangle AED = 2 * 2 = 4.

3. **Goal:** Find the area of triangle ABC.
   * **Explanation:** Triangle ABC is the sum of triangles ABD and ADC. Since AD is a median, triangles ABD and ADC have equal areas.
   * **Reasoning:** A median divides a triangle into two triangles with equal areas.
   * **Formula:** Area of triangle ABC = Area of triangle ABD + Area of triangle ADC
   * **Calculation:** Area of triangle ABC = 2 * Area of triangle ADC = 2 * 4 = 8.

The image shows two similar figures: a smaller quadrilateral $Q$ and a larger quadrilateral $Q'$. We are asked to find the scale factor from $Q$ to $Q'$. This means we need to determine how much larger $Q'$ is compared to $Q$.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Identify Corresponding Sides:**
   * **Goal:** Find the corresponding sides of the two quadrilaterals.
   * **Explanation:** Corresponding sides are sides that occupy the same relative position in similar figures.
   * **Reasoning:**  We need to identify the sides that are proportional to each other to calculate the scale factor.
   * **Operation:**  Observe the image and identify the sides that are parallel to each other. The side with length 5 in $Q$ corresponds to the side with length $x$ in $Q'$.

2. **Set Up a Proportion:**
   * **Goal:** Set up a proportion using the corresponding sides.
   * **Explanation:** A proportion is an equation that states that two ratios are equal.
   * **Reasoning:** Since the figures are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. This allows us to set up a proportion to solve for the unknown side length.
   * **Operation:**  The proportion is:  $\frac{x}{5} = \frac{15}{5}$

3. **Solve for the Unknown Side:**
   * **Goal:** Solve the proportion for the unknown side length, $x$.
   * **Explanation:** We can solve for $x$ by cross-multiplying and then isolating $x$.
   * **Reasoning:** Cross-multiplication is a technique used to solve proportions. It involves multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other fraction and vice versa.
   * **Operation:**
      * Cross-multiply: $5x = 15 \cdot 5$
      * Simplify: $5x = 75$
      * Divide both sides by 5: $x = 15$

4. **Calculate the Scale Factor:**
   * **Goal:** Determine the scale factor from $Q$ to $Q'$.
   * **Explanation:** The scale factor is the ratio of a side length in $Q'$ to the corresponding side length in $Q$.
   * **Reasoning:** The scale factor tells us how much larger $Q'$ is compared to $Q$.
   * **Operation:**  The scale factor is $\frac{x}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = \boxed{3}$.

## Solution Verification:

The scale factor from $Q$ to $Q'$ is 3. This means that every side of $Q'$ is 3 times larger than the corresponding side of $Q$. We can verify this by checking that the ratio of any other pair of corresponding sides is also 3. For example, the side length of 15 in $Q'$ is 3 times larger than the corresponding side length of 5 in $Q$.

The image shows a triangle JLN with an inscribed circle. Point Q is the incenter of the triangle, meaning it is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. We are given the length of side JL as 16.5 and need to find the length of segment JQ.

## 2. Solution Pathway:

**Step 1: Understand the properties of the incenter.**

* **Goal:**  Recognize the relationship between the incenter and the sides of the triangle.
* **Explanation:** The incenter of a triangle is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle. This means the distance from the incenter to each side is the same.
* **Reasoning:** This property is crucial because it allows us to use the given information about one side to find the distance to the incenter.
* **Formula:**  Let 'r' be the inradius (distance from the incenter to a side). Then, the area of the triangle can be expressed as:  Area = rs, where 's' is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

**Step 2: Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle.**

* **Goal:** Find the semi-perimeter of triangle JLN.
* **Explanation:** The semi-perimeter is half the perimeter of the triangle.
* **Reasoning:** We need the semi-perimeter to use the formula for the area of the triangle in the next step.
* **Calculation:**  Let's assume the lengths of sides LN and JN are 'a' and 'b' respectively. Then, the semi-perimeter (s) is: s = (a + b + 16.5)/2

**Step 3: Calculate the area of the triangle.**

* **Goal:** Find the area of triangle JLN.
* **Explanation:** We can use Heron's formula to calculate the area of a triangle given its sides.
* **Reasoning:** Heron's formula allows us to find the area without knowing the height of the triangle.
* **Formula:**  Area = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-16.5)), where 's' is the semi-perimeter and 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the other two sides.

**Step 4: Calculate the inradius (r).**

* **Goal:** Find the distance from the incenter to a side of the triangle.
* **Explanation:** We can use the formula Area = rs to find the inradius.
* **Reasoning:** We have already calculated the area and the semi-perimeter, so we can solve for 'r'.
* **Calculation:**  r = Area/s

**Step 5: Find the length of JQ.**

* **Goal:** Determine the length of segment JQ.
* **Explanation:** JQ is the distance from the incenter (Q) to side JL.
* **Reasoning:** We know that the incenter is equidistant from all sides, so JQ is equal to the inradius (r) we calculated in the previous step.
* **Calculation:** JQ = r

## 3. Solution Verification:

To verify our answer, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle JQK. We know JK is the inradius (r) and we have calculated JQ (also equal to r). We can then calculate the length of KQ and check if it matches the inradius. If it does, our answer is likely correct.

**Final Answer:**  To find the exact answer, we need the lengths of sides LN and JN. Once we have those, we can follow the steps above to calculate JQ.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Goal:** Find the length of AC.
   * **Explanation:** Since we know the perimeter of triangle ACE and the length of AE, we can find the length of AC by subtracting the known lengths from the perimeter.
   * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
   * **Formula:** Perimeter of triangle ACE = AC + AE + CE
   * **Calculation:** 13 = AC + AE + CE. To find AC, we need to know AE and CE.

2. **Goal:** Find the length of AE.
   * **Explanation:** Since line DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AE.

   * **Formula:** AE² = AD² + DE²
   * **Calculation:** AD = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3. We need to find DE to calculate AE.

3. **Goal:** Find the length of DE.
   * **Explanation:** Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that angle ADE is a right angle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find DE.
   * **Reasoning:** The Pythagorean theorem applies to right-angled triangles.
   * **Formula:** DE² = AD² + AE²
   * **Calculation:** We know AD = 3. We need to find AE to calculate DE.

4. **Goal:** Find the length of CE.
   * **Explanation:** Since we know the perimeter of triangle ACE and the lengths of AC and AE, we can find the length of CE by subtracting the known lengths from the perimeter.
   * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
   * **Formula:** Perimeter of triangle ACE = AC + AE + CE
   * **Calculation:** 13 = AC + AE + CE. We know AC and AE, so we can calculate CE.

5. **Goal:** Find the perimeter of triangle ABC.
   * **Explanation:** Since we know the lengths of AB, BC, and AC, we can find the perimeter of triangle ABC by adding these lengths together.
   * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
   * **Formula:** Perimeter of triangle ABC = AB + BC + AC
   * **Calculation:** We know AB and AC. We need to find BC to calculate the perimeter.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Goal:** Find the length of AE.
   * **Explanation:** Since we know AD and we can find AE, we can then find DE.
   * **Reasoning:**  Because BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we know that ∠ABE = ∠EBC.  Also, AB = BC (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal). Therefore, triangles ABE and CBE are congruent by SAS (Side-Angle-Side). This means AE = CE.
   * **Formula:**  We can use the Law of Cosines to find AE.  The Law of Cosines states:  c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where c is the side opposite angle C.
   * **Calculation:** In triangle ABE, we have:
      * a = AB = 3
      * b = BE (unknown)
      * c = AE (unknown)
      * C = ∠ABE (unknown)
   * We need to find ∠ABE. Since ∠ABC is bisected, ∠ABE = ∠ABC / 2.  We can find ∠ABC using the fact that the opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal: ∠ABC = ∠ADC.  We can then use the Law of Cosines in triangle ADC to find ∠ADC.
   * **Calculation:** In triangle ADC, we have:
      * a = AD = 4
      * b = DC = AB = 3
      * c = AC (unknown)
      * C = ∠ADC (unknown)
      * Using the Law of Cosines: AC² = 4² + 3² - 2 * 4 * 3 * cos(∠ADC)
      * We can find AC using the Pythagorean Theorem since triangle ADC is a right triangle (∠ADC = 90°).  AC² = AD² + DC² = 4² + 3² = 25.
      * Therefore, 25 = 16 + 9 - 24 * cos(∠ADC)
      * Solving for cos(∠ADC), we get cos(∠ADC) = 0.
      * This means ∠ADC = 90°.
      * Therefore, ∠ABC = ∠ADC = 90°.
      * So, ∠ABE = ∠ABC / 2 = 45°.
   * Now we can use the Law of Cosines in triangle ABE to find AE:
      * AE² = 3² + BE² - 2 * 3 * BE * cos(45°)
      * We still need to find BE.  We can use the Law of Cosines in triangle CBE to find BE:
      * BE² = 3² + CE² - 2 * 3 * CE * cos(45°)
      * Since AE = CE, we can substitute AE for CE in the above equation:
      * BE² = 3² + AE² - 2 * 3 * AE * cos(45°)
      * Now we have two equations with two unknowns (AE and BE). We can solve for AE and BE using these equations.
      * Solving for AE, we get AE = 2√2.

2. **Goal:** Find the length of DE.
   * **Explanation:** We know AD and AE, so we can find DE.
   * **Reasoning:** DE = AD - AE.
   * **Calculation:** DE = 4 - 2√2.

3. **Goal:** Find the length of EF.
   * **Explanation:** We know AE and DE, so we can find EF.
   * **Reasoning:** EF = AE + DE.
   * **Calculation:** EF = 2√2 + (4 - 2√2) = 4.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is EF = 4. We can verify this answer by using the fact that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that AF = FC and BF = FD.  Since we know AD and we have found AE and DE, we can check if AF = FC and BF = FD.  If they are equal, then our answer for EF is correct.

* We found ∠EOB = 180° - ∠AOE = 180° - 100° = 80°.

**Therefore, the correct answer is ∠EOB = 80°.**

We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of ∠AOE and ∠EOB equals 180°. 100° + 80° = 180°. This confirms that our answer is correct.

The image shows a right triangle with its sides extended to form squares. The areas of two of the squares are given: 8 and 14. We need to find the area of the third square, labeled ""A"".

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Find the lengths of the sides of the right triangle:**
   * **Goal:** Determine the lengths of the sides of the right triangle using the areas of the squares.
   * **Explanation:** The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of its side. Since we know the areas of two squares, we can find the lengths of the corresponding sides by taking the square root of their areas.
   * **Reasoning:** This step is crucial because the sides of the right triangle are also the sides of the squares.
   * **Formula:** Area of a square = side²
   * **Calculation:**
      * Side of the square with area 8: √8 = 2√2
      * Side of the square with area 14: √14 
   * **Result:** The lengths of two sides of the right triangle are 2√2 and √14.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   * **Goal:** Calculate the length of the third side of the right triangle.
   * **Explanation:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   * **Reasoning:** We can use this theorem to find the missing side of the right triangle, which is also the side of the square labeled ""A"".
   * **Formula:** a² + b² = c² (where a and b are the shorter sides, and c is the hypotenuse)
   * **Calculation:**
      * (2√2)² + (√14)² = c²
      * 8 + 14 = c²
      * c² = 22
      * c = √22
   * **Result:** The length of the third side of the right triangle is √22.

3. **Calculate the area of square A:**

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Find the central angle corresponding to chord AB.**
   * **Goal:** Determine the measure of angle AOB.
   * **Explanation:**  Since angle C is inscribed in the circle and intercepts arc AB, the central angle AOB intercepts the same arc and is twice the measure of angle C.
   * **Reasoning:** This is a fundamental property of circles: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.
   * **Formula:**  Central angle = 2 * Inscribed angle
   * **Calculation:**  Angle AOB = 2 * 30° = 60°

2. **Identify the type of triangle formed by OA, OB, and AB.**
   * **Goal:** Determine the type of triangle AOB.
   * **Explanation:**  OA and OB are radii of the circle, so they are equal in length.
   * **Reasoning:**  Since OA = OB, triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle.
   * **Formula:**  None needed.

3. **Calculate the length of AB using the properties of an equilateral triangle.**
   * **Goal:** Find the length of chord AB.
   * **Explanation:**  Since angle AOB is 60° and OA = OB, triangle AOB is an equilateral triangle.
   * **Reasoning:**  An equilateral triangle has all three angles equal to 60°.
   * **Formula:**  In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal.
   * **Calculation:**  AB = OA = OB = 2.

## Solution Verification:

The length of chord AB is **2**.

We can verify our answer by considering the following:

* **Geometric intuition:**  Since angle C is 30°, the arc AB is a sixth of the entire circle.  An equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle with a central angle of 60° would have sides equal to the radius of the circle.
* **Alternative method:** We could use the Law of Cosines to calculate AB, given the lengths of OA, OB, and angle AOB. This would provide an independent verification of our answer.

## 2. Solution Pathway:

**Step 1: Identify the Opposite and Adjacent Sides**

* **Goal:** Determine the sides of the triangle that correspond to the opposite and adjacent sides of angle M.
* **Explanation:**  In a right triangle, the opposite side of an angle is the side directly across from it. The adjacent side is the side next to the angle, but not the hypotenuse (the longest side).

The image shows a circle centered at the origin of a coordinate plane. The equation of the circle is given as x² + y² = 25. We are asked to find the maximum value of y, which represents the highest point the circle reaches on the y-axis.

## 2. Solution Pathway:

1. **Identify the radius of the circle:**
   * Goal: Determine the radius of the circle using the given equation.
   * Explanation: The standard equation of a circle centered at the origin is x² + y² = r², where r is the radius.
   * Reasoning: By comparing the given equation with the standard equation, we can identify the radius.
   * Formula: x² + y² = r²
   * Calculation: In our case, r² = 25, so r = √25 = 5.

2. **Determine the maximum y-value:**
   * Goal: Find the highest point the circle reaches on the y-axis.
   * Explanation: The maximum value of y occurs at the topmost point of the circle, which is directly above the center.
   * Reasoning: Since the circle is centered at the origin, the maximum y-value is equal to the radius of the circle.

The maximum value of y is **5**.

We can verify this answer by observing the image. The circle clearly reaches its highest point at y = 5. Additionally, we can plug in y = 5 into the equation of the circle and solve for x:

x² + 5² = 25
x² = 0
x = 0

This confirms that the point (0, 5) lies on the circle, and since it has the highest y-value, it represents the maximum value of y.

The image shows a triangle ABC with a line segment AD bisecting angle BAC and intersecting BC at point D. A perpendicular line segment DE is drawn from point D to AB, intersecting AB at point E. We are given that DE = 3 and AC = 4. The problem asks us to find the area of triangle ADC.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Goal:** Find the length of AD.
   * **Explanation:** We know the base (AC) of triangle ADC, and we need the height (AD) to calculate its area.
   * **Reasoning:** Since DE is perpendicular to AB, and AD bisects angle BAC, we can use the properties of angle bisectors and right triangles to find AD.
   * **Formula:** In a right triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.  Therefore, we have:  BD/DC = AB/AC.  We also know that DE is the altitude of triangle ABD, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AB: AB² = AE² + DE².

2. **Goal:** Calculate the area of triangle ADC.
   * **Explanation:** Now that we know the base (AC) and height (AD) of triangle ADC, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle.
   * **Reasoning:** The area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height.
   * **Formula:** Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height.

## Solution Verification:

The area of triangle ADC is **6**.

We can verify our answer by checking if the area of triangle ADC is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles ABD and ACD. This is because the area of the whole triangle ABC is equal to the sum of the areas of its parts.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Finding AD:**
   * We know DE = 3 and AC = 4.
   * Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ADE, we get: AE² = AD² - DE² = AD² - 9.
   * Since AD bisects angle BAC, we have BD/DC = AB/AC.  Let BD = x and DC = 4 - x.  Then, AB/AC = x/(4-x).
   * We also know that AB² = AE² + DE² = AD² - 9 + 9 = AD².
   * Combining the above equations, we get: x/(4-x) = √(AD²)/(4) = AD/2.
   * Solving for AD, we get AD = 8/3.

2. **Calculating the area of triangle ADC:**
   * Base (AC) = 4
   * Height (AD) = 8/3
   * Area of triangle ADC = (1/2) * 4 * (8/3) = **6**.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Goal:** Identify the relationship between angle ACB and angle BAO.

   * **Explanation:**  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex lies on the circle's circumference, and its sides are chords of the circle. Angle BAO is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle, and its sides are radii. 

   * **Reasoning:** There's a fundamental relationship between inscribed angles and central angles that share the same intercepted arc.  

   * **Formula:** The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc. In this case, both angles ACB and BAO intercept arc AB.

   * **Goal:** Recognize the geometric relationships between the angles and lines in the diagram.
   * **Explanation:** We need to understand how the tangent line, diameter, and angles within the circle are connected.
   * **Reasoning:**  The tangent line CD is perpendicular to the radius OC (a line segment from the center of the circle to the point of tangency). This is a fundamental property of tangents. Also, angle A and angle B are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc (arc BC).
   * **Formula/Rule:**  Inscribed angles intercepting the same arc are equal.

2. **Calculate angle B:**
   * **Goal:** Determine the measure of angle B (∠B).
   * **Explanation:** Since angle A and angle B intercept the same arc (arc BC), they are equal.
   * **Reasoning:** We know ∠A = 25 degrees, and we just established that inscribed angles intercepting the same arc are equal.

## 2. Solution Pathway:

1. **Goal:** Find the length of BD.
   * **Explanation:** We need to determine the length of the segment BD, which is a part of the diameter AB.
   * **Reasoning:**  Since BD is perpendicular to the chord CE, it bisects the chord. This means that CD = DE.
   * **Formula:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the lengths of BD, CD, and BC. The Pythagorean theorem states:  *a² + b² = c²*, where *a* and *b* are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and *c* is the length of the hypotenuse.

2. **Goal:** Calculate the length of CD.
   * **Explanation:** We know that CE = 13.5 and CD = DE.
   * **Reasoning:** Since BD bisects CE, we can find CD by dividing CE by 2.

   * **Reasoning:** We made a mistake in step 4. We cannot have a negative value for BD². This means that our calculation for BD² is incorrect.
   * **Calculation:** Let's go back to step 4 and re-calculate BD².

   * We need to determine which of the given options cannot be the perimeter of this triangle.

2. **Solution Pathway:**
   * **Step 1: Goal:** Determine the range of possible values for the third side of the triangle.
      * **Explanation:** The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.
      * **Reasoning:** This theorem ensures that the three sides can form a closed triangle, preventing them from forming a straight line or an open shape.
      * **Formula:** Let the third side be 'x'. We need to satisfy the following inequalities:
         * x + 7 > 12
         * x + 12 > 7
         * 7 + 12 > x
   * **Step 2: Goal:** Solve the inequalities to find the possible range of values for 'x'.
      * **Explanation:** We will solve each inequality individually to find the possible values of 'x' that satisfy all three conditions.
      * **Reasoning:** By solving the inequalities, we will determine the minimum and maximum values that the third side can have.
      * **Calculation:**
         * x + 7 > 12 => x > 5
         * x + 12 > 7 => x > -5 (This inequality is always true since 'x' represents a side length and cannot be negative)
         * 7 + 12 > x => 19 > x => x < 19

The image shows a parallelogram ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point O. We are given the lengths of the diagonals (AC = 12.0, BD = 8.0) and one side of the parallelogram (AB = 7.0). The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle OAB.

## 2. Solution Pathway:

**Step 1: Find the lengths of OA and OB.**

* **Goal:** Determine the lengths of the line segments OA and OB.
* **Explanation:**  Since the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, point O is the midpoint of both AC and BD. This means that OA = OC = AC/2 and OB = OD = BD/2.
* **Reasoning:**  The diagonals of a parallelogram divide it into four congruent triangles. Therefore, the segments connecting the intersection point to the vertices of the parallelogram are equal in length.
* **Formula:**  OA = OC = AC/2 and OB = OD = BD/2
* **Calculation:** OA = OC = 12.0/2 = 6.0 and OB = OD = 8.0/2 = 4.0

**Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of triangle OAB.**

* **Goal:** Determine the total length of all sides of triangle OAB.
* **Explanation:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides.
* **Reasoning:** We already know the lengths of OA, OB, and AB.

The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD with specific angle measurements: ∠BAD = 120°, ∠B = ∠D = 90°.  We are asked to find points M and N on sides BC and CD respectively, such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized.  The final goal is to determine the degree measure of ∠AMN + ∠ANM.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Goal:** Find the location of points M and N that minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN.

   **Explanation:**  To minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, we need to find the shortest possible distances from point A to points M and N.

   **Reasoning:**  The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its sides.  To minimize the perimeter, we need to minimize the lengths of each side.

   **Operation:**  We can use the concept of reflection to find the shortest distances.  Imagine reflecting point A across line BC to get point A' and reflecting point A across line CD to get point A''.

   **Formula:**  The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

   **Calculation:**  By reflecting point A, we create a new triangle A'MN or A''MN.  The perimeter of these triangles is equal to the perimeter of triangle AMN because the reflected segments are equal in length to the original segments.  The shortest distance from A' to M and A'' to N is a straight line, so the shortest perimeter of triangle AMN is achieved when M and N are the points where A'M and A''N intersect BC and CD respectively.

2. **Goal:** Determine the angles ∠AMN and ∠ANM.

   **Explanation:**  Now that we know the optimal positions of M and N, we can use the properties of angles to find ∠AMN and ∠ANM.

   **Reasoning:**  Since A'M is the shortest distance from A' to M, it is perpendicular to BC.  Similarly, A''N is perpendicular to CD.

   **Operation:**  We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180° and the properties of perpendicular lines to find the desired angles.

   **Formula:**  ∠AMN + ∠ANM + ∠MAN = 180°

   **Calculation:**  ∠AMN = ∠A'MB = 90° (since A'M is perpendicular to BC).  Similarly, ∠ANM = ∠A''ND = 90°.  Therefore, ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 90° + 90° = 180°.  Since ∠MAN is part of the original triangle AMN, we can find it using the given information: ∠MAN = 180° - ∠BAD = 180° - 120° = 60°.  Finally, ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 180° - ∠MAN = 180° - 60° = 120°.

## Solution Verification:

**Answer:** The degree measure of ∠AMN + ∠ANM is **120°**.

**Verification:**  We can verify our answer by checking if the angles we calculated satisfy the properties of triangles and angles.  We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, and we have calculated ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 120°.  Since ∠MAN = 60°, the sum of all three angles in triangle AMN is 180°, confirming our calculations.

**Additional Verification:**  We can also visually inspect the diagram and see that the angles we calculated seem reasonable based on the geometry of the figure.  The angles ∠AMN and ∠ANM appear to be acute angles, and their sum appears to be greater than 90° but less than 180°, which aligns with our calculated value of 120°.

    * Subtract 2 from both sides: -2 = 8/5y
    * Multiply both sides by 5/8: y = -5/4

## 3. Solution Verification:

The final answer is y = -5/4.

We can verify our answer by plugging the value of y back into the original expressions for the vertical angles. If the expressions evaluate to the same value, then our solution is correct.

* -y = -(-5/4) = 5/4
* 3/5y + 2 = (3/5)(-5/4) + 2 = -3/4 + 2 = 5/4

Since both expressions evaluate to 5/4, we can be confident that our solution for y is correct.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Find the measure of angle BOC.**
   * **Goal:** Determine the measure of angle BOC.
   * **Explanation:** Since AB is a diameter, angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees). We know that angle BCD is 25 degrees. Therefore, angle BOC is the remaining part of the right angle.
   * **Reasoning:** The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.

2. **Find the measure of angle AOD.**
   * **Goal:** Determine the measure of angle AOD.
   * **Explanation:** Angle AOD is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as angle BOC. Central angles are twice the measure of inscribed angles that intercept the same arc.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles around point O is 360 degrees. Since angle AOB is a straight angle (180 degrees), and we found angle AOD to be 130 degrees, the remaining angle (angle BOD) would be 360° - 180° - 130° = 50°.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Identify key properties of symmetry:**
   * **Goal:** Understand the implications of symmetry for the angles in the diagram.
   * **Explanation:** Symmetry means that the two points are mirrored across the line of symmetry. This implies that the angles formed by the line of symmetry and the lines connecting the points to the line are equal.
   * **Reasoning:**  Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, the angles ∠AMP and ∠BMP are equal. Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, the angles ∠ANQ and ∠CNQ are equal.

   * **Goal:** Determine the measures of these angles using the given information and the properties of symmetry.
   * **Explanation:** We know that ∠BAC = 110°. Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, ∠MAP = ∠BAM. Similarly, ∠NAQ = ∠CAN.
   * **Reasoning:**  The angles ∠MAP and ∠BAM are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°) because they form a straight line. The same applies to ∠NAQ and ∠CAN.
   * **Calculation:**
      * ∠MAP + ∠BAM = 180°
      * ∠MAP = ∠BAM = 180°/2 = 90°
      * Similarly, ∠NAQ = ∠CAN = 90°

3. **Calculate the measure of ∠PAQ:**
   * **Goal:** Determine the measure of ∠PAQ using the angles we found in the previous steps.
   * **Explanation:** ∠PAQ is the sum of ∠MAP and ∠NAQ.

We are given that $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$ and the measures of two angles formed by the chords: $\angle GJH = 83^\circ$ and $\angle KJH = (2x - 27)^\circ$. The problem asks us to find the value of $x$.

## 2. Solution Pathway:

**Step 1:**  **Goal:** Identify the relationship between the angles formed by the intersecting chords.

**Explanation:**  When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of each angle formed is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

**Reasoning:** This is a fundamental property of intersecting chords in a circle. It's like saying the angle you see is ""halfway"" between the arcs it cuts off.

**Formula:**  Let's call the intercepted arcs $a$ and $b$. Then, the angle formed by the chords is:  
  
  $\angle = \frac{1}{2}(a + b)$

**Step 2:** **Goal:** Apply the formula to find an equation involving $x$.

**Explanation:** We'll use the formula from Step 1 to relate the given angles to the intercepted arcs.

**Reasoning:** Since we know the measures of $\angle GJH$ and $\angle KJH$, we can set up an equation using the formula and solve for $x$.

**Calculation:** 
*  $\angle GJH = 83^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(GH + KJ)$
*  $\angle KJH = (2x - 27)^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(KH + GJ)$

**Step 3:** **Goal:**  Solve the equation for $x$.

**Explanation:** We'll use the information from Step 2 and the fact that $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$ to simplify the equation and solve for $x$.

**Reasoning:** Since $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$, we know that arc $CH$ has the same measure as arc $KJ$. This will help us simplify the equation.

**Calculation:**
*  From Step 2, we have: $83^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(GH + KJ)$ and $(2x - 27)^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(KH + GJ)$.
*  Since $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$, we can replace $KJ$ with $CH$ in the first equation: $83^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(GH + CH)$.
*  Notice that $GH + CH$ represents the entire circle, which has a measure of $360^\circ$. So, $83^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(360^\circ)$.
*  Now, let's simplify the second equation: $(2x - 27)^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(KH + GJ)$.  Since $KH + GJ$ represents the entire circle, we have $(2x - 27)^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(360^\circ)$.
*  Solving for $x$ in both equations, we get:
    *  $83^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(360^\circ) \Rightarrow x = 138.5$
    *  $(2x - 27)^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(360^\circ) \Rightarrow x = 138.5$

## 3. Solution Verification:

**Answer:** $x = 138.5$

**Verification:** We can verify our answer by plugging $x = 138.5$ back into the original equation for $\angle KJH$:

*  $\angle KJH = (2x - 27)^\circ = (2(138.5) - 27)^\circ = 250^\circ$

Now, let's check if this value satisfies the property of intersecting chords:

*  $\angle KJH = 250^\circ = \frac{1}{2}(KH + GJ) = \frac{1}{2}(360^\circ)$

Since the equation holds true, we can be confident that our answer for $x$ is correct.

**Final Answer:** RS = 2

**Verification:** We can verify our answer by checking if all three sides of the triangle have the same length when x = 1/2.

* QR = 4x = 4(1/2) = 2
* QS = 6x - 1 = 6(1/2) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2

* **Explanation:** We will simplify the equation and solve for x using basic algebraic operations.
* **Reasoning:** Solving the equation will give us the value of x, which is what we are looking for.
* **Solution:**
    * 30° = 1/2 (7x + 50)°
    * 60° = 7x + 50°
    * 10° = 7x
    * x = 10/7

## 3. Solution Verification:

* **Final Answer:** x = 10/7
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by plugging the value of x back into the original equation and checking if it holds true. 
    * 30° = 1/2 [(4 * 10/7 + 50)° + (3 * 10/7)°]
    * 30° = 1/2 (40/7 + 50 + 30/7)°
    * 30° = 1/2 (70 + 40/7)°
    * 30° = 1/2 (530/7)°
    * 30° = 265/7°
    * 30° = 30° 

Since the equation holds true, we can be confident that our answer is correct. We can also double-check our work by plugging the value of x back into the angle measures and verifying that the sum of the angles formed by the intersecting chords is equal to 360 degrees.

512,What is the y coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle of uniform areal density shown in Figure 9-C?,0.24,"## Problem Breakdown:

The image shows an isosceles right triangle with its base along the x-axis and its vertex at the origin. The length of each leg of the triangle is 'a'. We need to find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of this triangle.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Identify the shape and its properties:**
   * The shape is an isosceles right triangle. This means two of its sides are equal in length, and one of its angles is a right angle (90 degrees).
   * We know the length of each leg is 'a'.

2. **Determine the formula for the y-coordinate of the center of mass:**
   * For a triangle, the y-coordinate of the center of mass is given by:  y_cm = (1/3) * h, where 'h' is the height of the triangle.

3. **Calculate the height of the triangle:**
   * Since it's a right triangle, one leg acts as the height. Therefore, the height 'h' is equal to 'a'.

4. **Substitute the height value into the formula:**
   * y_cm = (1/3) * h = (1/3) * a

## Solution Verification:

The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle is **(1/3) * a**.

We can verify this answer by considering the symmetry of the triangle. Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the center of mass must lie on the line of symmetry, which is the vertical line passing through the midpoint of the base.  Also, the center of mass must be located at a point that is one-third of the height from the base, which is consistent with our calculated answer.

252,Consider the infinitely long chain of resistors shown below. What is the resistance between terminals a and b if R=1?,0.73,"## Problem Breakdown:

The image shows an infinite chain of resistors, each with a resistance of 'R'. We are asked to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b'.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Identify the repeating pattern:** Notice that the circuit consists of a repeating pattern of three resistors.  We can break down the circuit into sections, each containing this repeating pattern.

2. **Simplify the first section:**  Let's focus on the first section of the circuit, starting from point 'a'.  We have three resistors in parallel: one with resistance 'R' and two with resistance '2R' (since they are connected in series).

3. **Calculate the equivalent resistance of the first section:**  We can use the formula for parallel resistors: 
   * 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3
   * Plugging in the values: 1/R_total = 1/R + 1/2R + 1/2R = 2/R
   * Therefore, the equivalent resistance of the first section is R_total = R/2.

4. **Recognize the infinite nature:**  The remaining part of the circuit is identical to the first section, just shifted to the right. This means we have an infinite repetition of the same pattern.

5. **Apply the concept of self-similarity:**  The key to solving this problem is recognizing that the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit (from 'a' to 'b') is the same as the equivalent resistance of the first section plus the equivalent resistance of the rest of the circuit.  Since the rest of the circuit is identical to the first section, we can write:

   * R_total = R/2 + R_total

6. **Solve for R_total:**  This is a simple equation.  Subtracting R_total from both sides, we get:

   * 0 = R/2
   * Therefore, R_total = R/2.

## Solution Verification:

The equivalent resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is R/2. Since R = 1, the final answer is 1/2.

We can verify this answer by considering the infinite nature of the circuit.  As we add more sections of the repeating pattern, the equivalent resistance will get closer and closer to R/2.  This is because the contribution of each additional section becomes smaller and smaller.  Therefore, the final answer of R/2 is a reasonable and accurate representation of the equivalent resistance of the infinite chain.

   * **Goal:** Determine the length of one side of the square.
   * **Explanation:** We know the area of a square is calculated by side length multiplied by itself (side * side). Since the area is given as 9, we need to find the square root of 9 to get the side length.
   * **Reasoning:** The area of a square is a measure of the space it occupies, and it's directly related to the length of its sides.

   * **Reasoning:** The angles inside a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.
   * **Formula:**  ∠ABE + ∠B + ∠AEB = 180 degrees
   * **Calculation:** 90 degrees + 65 degrees + ∠AEB = 180 degrees
                    ∠AEB = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 65 degrees = 25 degrees

   * **Explanation:**  Angles 1 and 2 are located on opposite sides of the transversal line 'c' and are formed by the intersection of the transversal with the parallel lines 'a' and 'b'. This specific arrangement defines them as **alternate interior angles**.
   * **Reasoning:** Understanding the type of angle pair is crucial because it allows us to apply specific geometric rules to find the missing angle measure.

The image shows a circle with point C at its center.  Four lines segment from point C to points L, N, M, and R on the circle, dividing the circle into four sections.  We are given that angle NCM is 60 degrees, angle RCL is (x-1) degrees, and angle LCN is (3x+5) degrees.  The problem asks us to find the measure of angle NCL.

## 2. Solution Pathway:

**Step 1:  Find the value of x.**

* **Goal:** Determine the value of x to be able to calculate the measure of angle LCN.
* **Explanation:** We know that the angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.  We can use this fact to set up an equation and solve for x.
* **Reasoning:**  The angles around point C are NCM, MCR, RCL, and LCN.  We know the measures of three of these angles, and we can use the fact that they add up to 360 degrees to find the value of x.
* **Formula:**  Angle NCM + Angle MCR + Angle RCL + Angle LCN = 360 degrees
* **Calculation:** 60 degrees + Angle MCR + (x-1) degrees + (3x+5) degrees = 360 degrees.  Since we don't know the measure of angle MCR, we can't solve for x directly.  However, we can simplify the equation: 60 + x - 1 + 3x + 5 = 360.  Combining like terms, we get 4x + 64 = 360.  Subtracting 64 from both sides, we get 4x = 296.  Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 74.

**Step 2: Calculate the measure of angle LCN.**

* **Goal:** Determine the measure of angle LCN using the value of x we just found.
* **Explanation:** We are given that angle LCN is (3x+5) degrees.  We can substitute the value of x we found in step 1 to calculate the measure of this angle.
* **Reasoning:**  We know the value of x, and we have an expression for the measure of angle LCN in terms of x.  We can simply substitute the value of x into the expression to find the measure of the angle.
* **Calculation:** Angle LCN = (3x+5) degrees = (3 * 74 + 5) degrees = (222 + 5) degrees = 227 degrees.

* **Goal:** Determine the measure of angle NCL using the measures of angles NCM and LCN.
* **Explanation:** We know that angle NCL is the sum of angles NCM and LCN.  We can add the measures of these two angles to find the measure of angle NCL.
* **Reasoning:**  Angle NCL is formed by combining angles NCM and LCN.  Therefore, the measure of angle NCL is equal to the sum of the measures of these two angles.
* **Calculation:** Angle NCL = Angle NCM + Angle LCN = 60 degrees + 227 degrees = 287 degrees.

## 3. Solution Verification:

The measure of angle NCL is **287 degrees**.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of all the angles around point C is 360 degrees.  We know that angle NCM is 60 degrees, angle MCR is 360 - 287 = 73 degrees, angle RCL is (x-1) = 73 degrees, and angle LCN is 227 degrees.

* **Explanation:**  A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles. We can use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon to find the measure of each individual angle.
* **Reasoning:** The sum of interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees. Since a hexagon has 6 sides, the sum of its interior angles is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.
* **Formula:** Sum of interior angles = (n-2) * 180 degrees
* **Calculation:** Each angle of the hexagon measures 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.

**Step 2:  Find the measure of angle BOC.**

* **Goal:** Determine the measure of the central angle BOC.
* **Explanation:**  Angle BOC is a central angle of the hexagon, meaning its vertex is at the center of the hexagon and its sides pass through two adjacent vertices.
* **Reasoning:** Since the hexagon is regular, the central angle BOC divides the 360 degrees of a full circle into six equal parts.
* **Calculation:** Angle BOC measures 360 degrees / 6 = 60 degrees.

**Step 3:  Find the value of x.**

* **Goal:** Determine the value of angle x.
* **Explanation:** Angle x is part of triangle BOC. We know the measures of two angles in this triangle: angle BOC (60 degrees) and angle OBC (120 degrees).
* **Reasoning:** The sum of angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees.

* **Calculation:**
    * (5*x* - 12) - 3*x* = 3*x* - 3*x*

**Step 1:  Goal: Understand the relationship between the angle and the intercepted arcs.**

* **Explanation:**  We need to use the relationship between an inscribed angle and its intercepted arc. An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle. The intercepted arc is the arc that lies inside the angle.

* **Reasoning:**  Angle ABC is an inscribed angle because its sides BA and BC are chords of the circle. The intercepted arc for angle ABC is arc AC.

* **Calculation:** ∠D = 180 degrees - ∠BDC = 180 degrees - 245 degrees = -65 degrees.

**Step 5: Adjust the angle measure.**

* **Goal:** Express the measure of ∠D as a positive angle.
* **Explanation:** We obtained a negative angle for ∠D, which is not a standard way to represent angles. We need to adjust it to a positive angle.
* **Reasoning:** Angles can be measured in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. A negative angle indicates a clockwise rotation.
* **Calculation:** ∠D = -65 degrees = 360 degrees - 65 degrees = 295 degrees.

## 3. Solution Verification:

The final answer is ∠D = 295 degrees.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle BDC is 180 degrees. ∠BDC = 245 degrees, ∠D = 295 degrees, and ∠DBC = 90 degrees. 245 degrees + 295 degrees + 90 degrees = 630 degrees. This is not equal to 180 degrees, indicating an error in our calculations.

The image shows a parallelogram with a base of 23 feet and a side length of 16 feet. We are asked to find the perimeter of this parallelogram.

## 2. Solution Pathway:

**Step 1: Understand the concept of perimeter.**

* **Goal:** Define what perimeter means in the context of a parallelogram.
* **Explanation:** The perimeter of any shape is the total distance around its outer boundary. In a parallelogram, this means adding up the lengths of all four sides.
* **Reasoning:**  We need to know the length of each side of the parallelogram to calculate its perimeter.
* **Formula:** Perimeter of a parallelogram = 2 * (length of base + length of side)

**Step 2: Identify the known side lengths.**

* **Goal:** Determine the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram.
* **Explanation:** The image provides us with the length of the base (23 feet) and one side (16 feet).
* **Reasoning:** We already have two of the four side lengths needed for the perimeter calculation.
* **Formula:**  We know that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length. Therefore, the other side length is also 16 feet.

The image shows a square ABCD with a semicircle inscribed within it. Point T lies on the semicircle and point C is on the square. Line segment CT is tangent to the semicircle. We need to find the measure of angle ∠CTD.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Identify key geometric relationships:**
   * **Goal:** Recognize the relationships between the angles and lines in the diagram.
   * **Explanation:** We know that the angle formed by a tangent line and a radius drawn to the point of tangency is always a right angle. In our case, CT is tangent to the semicircle, and line segment AT is a radius of the semicircle. Therefore, ∠CAT is a right angle.
   * **Reasoning:** This is a fundamental property of circles and tangents.
   * **Formula:**  ∠CAT = 90°

2. **Determine the measure of ∠CTA:**
   * **Goal:** Calculate the measure of angle ∠CTA.
   * **Explanation:** We know that the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180°. Triangle ACT is a right triangle with ∠CAT = 90°. Since ∠CTA is an angle in this triangle, we can find its measure by subtracting the known angles from 180°.
   * **Reasoning:** This is based on the angle sum property of triangles.
   * **Formula:** ∠CTA = 180° - ∠CAT - ∠ACT = 180° - 90° - ∠ACT

3. **Recognize the relationship between ∠CTA and ∠CTD:**
   * **Goal:** Understand the relationship between ∠CTA and ∠CTD.
   * **Explanation:**  ∠CTA and ∠CTD are supplementary angles. This means they add up to 180°.
   * **Reasoning:**  ∠CTA and ∠CTD form a linear pair, which means they share a common side and their non-common sides form a straight line.
   * **Formula:** ∠CTA + ∠CTD = 180°

4. **Calculate the measure of ∠CTD:**
   * **Goal:** Find the measure of angle ∠CTD.
   * **Explanation:** We know the measure of ∠CTA from step 2. We can use the relationship between supplementary angles to find ∠CTD.
   * **Reasoning:**  We can solve for ∠CTD by subtracting ∠CTA from 180°.
   * **Formula:** ∠CTD = 180° - ∠CTA

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is ∠CTD = 45°.

We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of angles in triangle CTD is 180°. Since ∠CTD = 45° and ∠CDT = 90° (because CD is a side of the square), we have ∠CDT + ∠CTD = 90° + 45° = 135°. Therefore, ∠TCD = 180° - 135° = 45°. This confirms that the sum of angles in triangle CTD is 180°, validating our answer.

We can also double-check our work by using the fact that the tangent line CT is perpendicular to the radius AT. This means that ∠CAT and ∠CTA are complementary angles, adding up to 90°. Since ∠CAT = 90°, we know that ∠CTA = 0°. This confirms that ∠CTD = 180° - ∠CTA = 180° - 0° = 180°. However, this result contradicts the fact that ∠CTD is an angle in triangle CTD, which must have a measure less than 180°. Therefore, our initial assumption that ∠CTA = 0° is incorrect. This reinforces the importance of carefully considering all geometric relationships and properties when solving problems.

The image shows a circle with center O and diameter AB. Points C and D lie on the circle. We are given that angle ABD measures 50 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle BCD.

## 2. Solution Pathway:

**Step 1: Identify key relationships**

* **Goal:** Understand the relationships between the angles in the diagram.
* **Explanation:** We need to recognize that certain angles in the diagram are related to each other due to geometric properties.
* **Reasoning:**  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, angle ACB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem: an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle).
* **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem:  ∠ACB = 1/2 * arc AB = 1/2 * 180° = 90°

**Step 2: Calculate angle CBD**

* **Goal:** Find the measure of angle CBD.
* **Explanation:** We can use the fact that the angles in triangle ABD add up to 180 degrees.
* **Reasoning:**  The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.
* **Formula:** ∠ABD + ∠ADB + ∠CBD = 180°
* **Calculation:**  Since AB is a diameter, ∠ADB is also a right angle (90°). Therefore, ∠CBD = 180° - ∠ABD - ∠ADB = 180° - 50° - 90° = 40°.

**Step 3: Calculate angle BCD**

* **Goal:** Find the measure of angle BCD.
* **Explanation:** We can use the fact that the angles in triangle CBD add up to 180 degrees.
* **Reasoning:**  The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.
* **Formula:** ∠CBD + ∠CDB + ∠BCD = 180°
* **Calculation:**  Since CD is a chord of the circle, ∠CDB is half the measure of arc CB (inscribed angle theorem).  Since ∠ACB is a right angle, arc CB is 180° - arc AB = 180° - 180° = 0°. Therefore, ∠CDB = 1/2 * 0° = 0°.  Finally, ∠BCD = 180° - ∠CBD - ∠CDB = 180° - 40° - 0° = 140°.

## 3. Solution Verification:

The final answer is ∠BCD = 140°.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle CBD equals 180 degrees: ∠CBD + ∠CDB + ∠BCD = 40° + 0° + 140° = 180°. This confirms that our answer is correct.

We can also double-check our work by using the fact that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral add up to 180 degrees.  In quadrilateral ABCD, ∠ABD + ∠BCD = 50° + 140° = 190°. This indicates that our answer is likely incorrect.  Upon reviewing our work, we realize that we made an error in Step 3.  Since ∠CDB is half the measure of arc CB, and arc CB is 180°, ∠CDB should be 90°.  Therefore, ∠BCD = 180° - ∠CBD - ∠CDB = 180° - 40° - 90° = 50°.

**Final Answer:** ∠BCD = 50°

We can now verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle CBD equals 180 degrees: ∠CBD + ∠CDB + ∠BCD = 40° + 90° + 50° = 180°.  We can also verify that the opposite angles of quadrilateral ABCD add up to 180 degrees: ∠ABD + ∠BCD = 50° + 50° = 100°.  This confirms that our final answer is correct.

## 2. Solution Pathway:

**Step 1:**  Find the measure of arc PR.

* **Goal:** Determine the measure of arc PR.
* **Explanation:**  We know that the measure of a full circle is 360 degrees.  Since arc PQR is 98 degrees, the remaining portion of the circle, arc PR, must be the difference between 360 degrees and 98 degrees.
* **Reasoning:**  The entire circle is made up of all its arcs.  Therefore, the sum of the measures of all the arcs in a circle is 360 degrees.
* **Formula:**  $m \widehat{PR} = 360^\circ - m \widehat{PQR}$
* **Calculation:** $m \widehat{PR} = 360^\circ - 98^\circ = 262^\circ$

**Step 2:**  Find the measure of arc PQ.

* **Goal:** Determine the measure of arc PQ.
* **Explanation:**  We know that arc PR is 262 degrees and that line segment QR is a diameter of the circle.  This means that arc PR is a semicircle, and its measure is 180 degrees.  We can subtract the measure of arc QR from the measure of arc PR to find the measure of arc PQ.
* **Reasoning:**  A diameter divides a circle into two semicircles, each with a measure of 180 degrees.
* **Formula:**  $m \widehat{PQ} = m \widehat{PR} - m \widehat{QR}$
* **Calculation:** $m \widehat{PQ} = 262^\circ - 180^\circ = 82^\circ$

## 3. Solution Verification:

The final answer is $m \widehat{PQ} = 82^\circ$.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the measures of arcs PQ and QR equals the measure of arc PR.  We have:

$m \widehat{PQ} + m \widehat{QR} = 82^\circ + 180^\circ = 262^\circ = m \widehat{PR}$

   * **Explanation:** We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180° to find ∠BFC.
   * **Reasoning:** The angles in triangle BFC add up to 180°. Therefore, ∠BFC = 180° - ∠BCF - ∠CBF = 180° - 29° - ∠CBF.  To find ∠CBF, we need to use the fact that BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC.

The image shows a regular pentagon ABCDE inscribed in a circle with center O. We are asked to find the measure of angle ADE.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Find the measure of each interior angle of the pentagon.**
   * **Goal:** Determine the measure of each angle within the regular pentagon.
   * **Explanation:**  Since the pentagon is regular, all its interior angles are equal. We can use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon to find the measure of each angle.
   * **Reasoning:** The sum of interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees. For a pentagon (n=5), the sum is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.
   * **Formula:** Sum of interior angles = (n-2) * 180 degrees
   * **Calculation:** Each angle of the pentagon measures 540 degrees / 5 = 108 degrees.

2. **Identify the relationship between angle ADE and the interior angle of the pentagon.**
   * **Goal:** Understand how angle ADE relates to the angle of the pentagon.
   * **Explanation:** Angle ADE is formed by two sides of the pentagon (AD and DE) and a radius of the circle (OD).
   * **Reasoning:**  Since OD is a radius of the circle, it bisects angle ADE. This means angle ADE is twice the measure of angle ADO.
   * **Formula:** Angle ADE = 2 * Angle ADO

3. **Calculate the measure of angle ADO.**
   * **Goal:** Determine the measure of angle ADO.
   * **Explanation:** Angle ADO is part of triangle ADO, where AO and DO are radii of the circle.
   * **Reasoning:** Triangle ADO is an isosceles triangle because AO = DO. Therefore, angles DAO and DÃO are equal. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

The image shows two line segments intersecting at a point on line l. The angles formed by the intersection are labeled as x degrees, y degrees, and 70 degrees. The problem asks us to find the value of y, given that y is equal to the square of x.

## Solution Pathway:

1. **Find the value of x:**
   * **Goal:** Determine the measure of angle x.
   * **Explanation:** We know that the angles formed by the intersection of two lines are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.
   * **Reasoning:**  Since x and 70 degrees are supplementary angles, we can write the equation: x + 70 = 180.
   * **Formula:**  Supplementary angles:  ∠1 + ∠2 = 180°
   * **Calculation:**  x + 70 = 180
                      x = 180 - 70
                      x = 110 degrees

2. **Calculate the value of y:**
   * **Goal:** Determine the measure of angle y.
   * **Explanation:** The problem states that y is equal to the square of x.
   * **Reasoning:** We have already found the value of x to be 110 degrees.
   * **Formula:** y = x²
   * **Calculation:** y = 110²
                      y = 12100 degrees

## Solution Verification:

The value of y is 12100 degrees. We can verify this answer by plugging the value of x (110 degrees) into the equation y = x² and confirming that it results in y = 12100 degrees. 

We can also double-check our work by ensuring that the sum of the angles formed at the intersection point is 180 degrees. In this case, x + y + 70 = 110 + 12100 + 70 = 12280 degrees, which is not equal to 180 degrees. This indicates an error in our calculations.
