643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Properties:**
   - **Diameter:** CD is the diameter of the circle, meaning it passes through the center O and divides the circle into two equal halves.
   - **Parallel Lines:** DE is parallel to OA, which means they have the same angle measures when intersected by a transversal (like line CO).
   - **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle (like ∠D) is half the measure of its intercepted arc (arc CE).

2. **Finding the Measure of Arc CE:**
   - Since ∠D = 50°, and it intercepts arc CE, we know arc CE = 2 * ∠D = 2 * 50° = 100°.

3. **Finding the Measure of ∠COA:**
   - ∠COA is a central angle that intercepts the same arc CE as ∠D.  Central angles are equal to the measure of their intercepted arc, so ∠COA = 100°.

4. **Finding the Measure of ∠C:**
   - Since DE || OA, we know ∠CDE = ∠COA = 100° (corresponding angles).
   - Triangle CDE is an isosceles triangle (CD = CE, both radii of the circle). Therefore, ∠CED = ∠CDE = 100°.
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so ∠C = 180° - ∠CDE - ∠CED = 180° - 100° - 100° = -20°.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The degree of ∠C is **-20°**. However, angles are typically measured between 0° and 360°.  Since ∠C is negative, it means it's measured in the opposite direction.  Therefore, the actual measure of ∠C is 360° - 20° = **340°**.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"We can use the trigonometric function sine to solve for $h$.  Sine is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle.  In this case, the opposite side is $h$ and the hypotenuse is 4.  We know that the angle opposite $h$ is $60^\circ$.  Therefore, we can write the equation:

$$\sin 60^\circ = \frac{h}{4}$$

We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.  Substituting this into the equation, we get:

$$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{h}{4}$$

To solve for $h$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

$$4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = h$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$h = 2\sqrt{3}$$

Therefore, the value of $h$ is $\boxed{2\sqrt{3}}$.",False,0,2.4829041957855225,527.0

An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.

**Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, ∠ABC intercepts arc AC.

**Step 3: Find the measure of arc AC.**

Since ∠ABC = 70°, and it intercepts arc AC, then the measure of arc AC is 2 * 70° = 140°.

**Step 4: Understand the relationship between central angles and intercepted arcs.**

A central angle intercepts the same arc as its corresponding inscribed angle. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

**Step 5: Determine the measure of ∠AOC.**

Since ∠AOC intercepts arc AC, and the measure of arc AC is 140°, then the measure of ∠AOC is 140°.

1. **Identify the relevant angles:** We are given that ∠AOD = 70° and that OE bisects ∠BOC. This means that ∠BOE = ∠COE.

2. **Use the concept of supplementary angles:**  ∠AOD and ∠DOB are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180°. Therefore, ∠DOB = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.

3. **Use the concept of vertical angles:** ∠DOB and ∠COA are vertical angles, meaning they are equal. Therefore, ∠COA = ∠DOB = 110°.

What is the $x$ component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3?",0.17,"The problem asks for the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.  To solve this, we need to consider the forces exerted on particle 3 by each of the other particles.

**1. Forces due to particles 1 and 2:**

* **Particle 1:** The force exerted by particle 1 on particle 3 is attractive because they have opposite charges. This force acts along the diagonal of the square.  Since the x-component of this force is equal to the force multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the force and the x-axis, and the angle is 45 degrees, the x-component of the force due to particle 1 is:
    * F_1x = (k * |q1| * |q3| / (a * sqrt(2))^2) * cos(45) 
    * where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 * 10^9 N*m^2/C^2), q1 and q3 are the charges of particles 1 and 3 respectively, and a is the side length of the square.

* **Particle 2:** The force exerted by particle 2 on particle 3 is repulsive because they have the same charge. This force acts horizontally to the right. The x-component of this force is simply the force itself:
    * F_2x = k * |q2| * |q3| / a^2

**2. Forces due to particles 4:**

* **Particle 4:** The force exerted by particle 4 on particle 3 is repulsive because they have the same charge. This force acts horizontally to the left. The x-component of this force is:
    * F_4x = -k * |q4| * |q3| / a^2

**3. Net force:**

The net force on particle 3 in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the forces due to each of the other particles:

* F_netx = F_1x + F_2x + F_4x

**4. Calculation:**

Now we can plug in the values given in the problem:

* q1 = -100 nC = -100 * 10^-9 C
* q2 = 100 nC = 100 * 10^-9 C
* q3 = -200 nC = -200 * 10^-9 C
* q4 = 200 nC = 200 * 10^-9 C
* a = 5.0 cm = 0.05 m

* **Tangents from a point:**  Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.
* **Tangent-radius property:** A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means angles OAC and OBD are right angles.

**Step 3: Analyze the triangle**

* **Right triangles:** Triangles OAC and OBD are right-angled triangles.
* **Equal sides:**  OA = OB (radii of the same circle) and AC = BD (tangents from the same point).

$$JK = \sqrt{JQ^2 - QK^2}$$

We don't know $JQ$ or $QK$, but we can use the fact that $Q$ is the incenter to find them.  The incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle, so $QK = QM = 9$.  We can also use the fact that the incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors to find $JQ$.  Since $\overline{JQ}$ bisects $\angle J$, we know that $\angle JQK = \angle JQN$.

**Step 1: Understand the properties of a perpendicular bisector.**

A perpendicular bisector cuts a line segment into two equal parts and forms a right angle with the line segment. Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

**Step 2: Use the perimeter information to find AC.**

The perimeter of triangle ACE is the sum of its sides: AC + CE + AE = 13. We know that AE = AD + DE, and since DE is a perpendicular bisector, AD = DB = 3. Therefore, AE = 3 + DE.

Substituting this into the perimeter equation, we get: AC + CE + (3 + DE) = 13.

**Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find CE.**

Triangle CDE is a right triangle with CD as the hypotenuse. We know that DE is half of AB, so DE = 3. We also know that CD = CB - DB = CB - 3.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find CE:

CE² = CD² + DE²
CE² = (CB - 3)² + 3²
CE² = CB² - 6CB + 9 + 9
CE² = CB² - 6CB + 18

**Step 4: Substitute CE into the perimeter equation and solve for CB.**

We know that AC + CE + (3 + DE) = 13. Substituting CE² = CB² - 6CB + 18, we get:

AC + √(CB² - 6CB + 18) + (3 + 3) = 13

Simplifying the equation:

AC + √(CB² - 6CB + 18) = 7

Since AC = AB - DB = 6 - 3 = 3, we can substitute it into the equation:

3 + √(CB² - 6CB + 18) = 7

√(CB² - 6CB + 18) = 4

Squaring both sides:

CB² - 6CB + 18 = 16

CB² - 6CB + 2 = 0

Solving the quadratic equation, we get:

CB = 3 ± √7

Since CB is a length, it must be positive. Therefore, CB = 3 + √7.

The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC. We know that AB = 6, BC = 3 + √7, and AC = 3. Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC is:

6 + (3 + √7) + 3 = **12 + √7**

* **Parallelogram Properties:** Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel. Opposite angles are equal. Diagonals bisect each other.
* **Angle Bisector Property:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.

**Step 2: Apply the angle bisector property.**

Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE. Similarly, since CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, we have ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

**Step 3: Use the properties of parallelograms to find angles.**

* ∠ABC = ∠CDA (opposite angles of parallelogram)
* ∠ABE = ∠CBE (angle bisector)
* ∠BCF = ∠DCF (angle bisector)

Therefore, ∠ABE = ∠CBE = ∠BCF = ∠DCF.

**Step 4: Identify similar triangles.**

Triangles ABE and CFE are similar because:

* ∠ABE = ∠CFE (corresponding angles)
* ∠BAE = ∠FCE (corresponding angles)

**Step 5: Use the properties of similar triangles to find EF.**

Since triangles ABE and CFE are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. Therefore:

EF/BE = CE/AE

**Step 6: Express BE and CE in terms of known lengths.**

* BE = BC/2 (since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC)

The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In this case, ∠ADC intercepts arc AC.  Since ∠ADC = 26°, arc AC must measure 2 * 26° = 52°.

We are given a right triangle ABC, where angle BAC is 90 degrees. We rotate this triangle 90 degrees clockwise around point A to get a new triangle AB'C'. We are also given that angle CC'B' is 32 degrees. We need to find the size of angle AC'B'.

**Step 2: Visualize the rotation**

Imagine rotating triangle ABC clockwise around point A. This means that point B will move to a new position, which we call B', and point C will move to a new position, which we call C'. The angle between the original line BC and the new line B'C' will be 90 degrees because of the rotation.

**Step 3: Analyze the angles**

* Since ∠BAC = 90 degrees, and we rotated the triangle by 90 degrees, ∠B'AC' will also be 90 degrees.
* We are given that ∠CC'B' = 32 degrees.
* The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, in triangle AB'C', we have: ∠AB'C' + ∠B'AC' + ∠AC'B' = 180 degrees.

**Step 4: Solve for the unknown angle**

We know ∠B'AC' = 90 degrees and ∠CC'B' = 32 degrees.  Since ∠AB'C' and ∠CC'B' are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees), we can find ∠AB'C':

∠AB'C' = 180 degrees - ∠CC'B' = 180 degrees - 32 degrees = 148 degrees.

Now we can find ∠AC'B':

∠AC'B' = 180 degrees - ∠AB'C' - ∠B'AC' = 180 degrees - 148 degrees - 90 degrees = -58 degrees.

**Step 5: Final answer**

The size of ∠AC'B' is **-58 degrees**. However, angles are typically measured between 0 and 360 degrees.  Since we are dealing with a rotation, we can add 360 degrees to get the equivalent positive angle: -58 degrees + 360 degrees = **302 degrees**.

   - Since BE bisects angle FBD, angle FBE = angle EBD.
   - Since CE bisects angle ACD, angle ACE = angle ECD.
   - Angle BEC is an exterior angle of triangle BCE.  The measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, angle BEC = angle BCE + angle CBE.

* ∠AOB is the central angle that intercepts the same arc AB.

Therefore, according to the Inscribed Angle Theorem:

∠AOB = 2 * ∠ACB = 2 * 25° = 50°

**Step 3: Find ∠BAO**

* ∠AOB is the central angle of triangle AOB.
* ∠BAO and ∠ABO are the other two angles of triangle AOB.

Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, we have:

∠BAO + ∠ABO + ∠AOB = 180°

Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal in length. Therefore, triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle, and ∠BAO = ∠ABO.

**1. Understand the Properties**

* **Tangent-Radius Property:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OCB = 90°.
* **Angles in a Triangle:** The angles inside a triangle add up to 180°.

**2. Apply the Properties**

* **Triangle OCB:** Since ∠OCB = 90° and ∠BOC is half of ∠A (because it's a central angle subtending the same arc as ∠A), we have ∠BOC = 25°/2 = 12.5°.  Therefore, ∠CBO = 180° - 90° - 12.5° = 77.5°.

* **Triangle ABD:**  ∠BAD = ∠A = 25°.  Since ∠CBO and ∠D are supplementary angles (they add up to 180° because they form a straight line), we have ∠D = 180° - ∠CBO = 180° - 77.5° = 102.5°.

We are given a triangle ABC with two angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. We know that angle A is 110 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle BOC.

**Step 2: Apply the angle bisector theorem**

The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.

Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, we can apply the angle bisector theorem to find the following:

We are given a circle with four angles around the center point C. We know one angle is 60 degrees, and the other two are expressed in terms of x. We need to find the measure of angle NCL.

**Step 2: Use the fact that angles around a point add up to 360 degrees**

The angles around point C form a complete circle, so their sum is 360 degrees.  We can write this as an equation:

* We know that the tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Therefore, ∠OBC = 90° and ∠OCD = 90°.
* We also know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°.

**Step 2: Find ∠ACO.**

* Since ∠OBC = 90°, we have ∠ABO + ∠BAO = 90°.
* Since AB is a diameter, ∠ACB = 90° (angle inscribed in a semicircle).
