643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"The math problem in the image asks us to find the measure of angle C, denoted as ∠C, in a circle with center O. We are given that CD is the diameter of the circle, chord DE is parallel to chord OA, and the measure of angle D, denoted as ∠D, is 50 degrees.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the relationship between ∠D and ∠A.**

* **Operation:**  Recognizing the relationship between angles.
* **Reasoning:** Since CD is the diameter of the circle, ∠D and ∠A are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc, CA. 
* **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem: The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Explanation:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem tells us that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, both ∠D and ∠A intercept arc CA. Therefore, they have the same measure.

**Step 2: Determine the measure of ∠A.**

* **Operation:**  Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
* **Reasoning:** We know that ∠D = 50 degrees, and since ∠D and ∠A intercept the same arc, they have the same measure.
* **Formula:**  ∠A = ∠D
* **Explanation:**  We are using the fact that ∠D and ∠A intercept the same arc, so they have the same measure.

**Step 3: Identify the relationship between ∠A and ∠C.**

* **Operation:**  Recognizing the relationship between angles.
* **Reasoning:**  Since DE is parallel to OA, ∠A and ∠C are alternate interior angles.
* **Formula:**  Alternate Interior Angles Theorem: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the alternate interior angles are congruent.
* **Explanation:** The Alternate Interior Angles Theorem states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the alternate interior angles are congruent. In this case, DE and OA are parallel lines, and line AC is the transversal. Therefore, ∠A and ∠C are congruent.

**Step 4: Determine the measure of ∠C.**

* **Operation:**  Applying the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem.
* **Reasoning:** We know that ∠A = 50 degrees, and since ∠A and ∠C are alternate interior angles, they have the same measure.
* **Formula:**  ∠C = ∠A
* **Explanation:** We are using the fact that ∠A and ∠C are alternate interior angles, so they have the same measure.

**Final Answer:** ∠C = 50 degrees.

**Verification:** We can be absolutely sure that the answer is correct because we have used established geometric theorems, the Inscribed Angle Theorem and the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, to logically deduce the measure of ∠C. These theorems are fundamental principles in geometry and are universally accepted as true.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees and the side opposite that angle measuring 4 units. The problem asks us to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is labeled as *h*.

To solve this problem, we can use the trigonometric function sine. 

**Step 1: Identify the trigonometric function to use.**

* The sine function (sin) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle. 
* We know the length of the opposite side (4 units) and we want to find the length of the hypotenuse (*h*). 
* Therefore, we can use the sine function to solve for *h*.

**Step 2: Write the formula for the sine function.**

* sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse

**Step 3: Substitute the known values into the formula.**

* sin(60°) = 4 / *h*

**Step 4: Solve for *h*.**

* Multiply both sides of the equation by *h*: 
    * *h* * sin(60°) = 4
* Divide both sides of the equation by sin(60°):
    * *h* = 4 / sin(60°)

**Step 5: Calculate the value of sin(60°) and simplify the expression.**

* sin(60°) = √3 / 2
* *h* = 4 / (√3 / 2)
* *h* = 4 * (2 / √3)
* *h* = 8 / √3

**Step 6: Rationalize the denominator.**

* Multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:
    * *h* = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
    * *h* = 8√3 / 3

Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse, *h*, is **8√3 / 3 units**.

We can be absolutely sure this answer is correct because we used the correct trigonometric function (sine) and followed the steps of solving for *h* accurately. We also rationalized the denominator to express the answer in its simplest form.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the relationship between the inscribed angle and the central angle.**

* **Operation:**  Observing the diagram and recalling geometric principles.
* **Reasoning:**  In a circle, an inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle's circumference. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.  The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.

**Step 2: Apply the inscribed angle theorem.**

* **Operation:**  Using the inscribed angle theorem to find the measure of the central angle.
* **Reasoning:**  Since angle ABC is an inscribed angle and angle AOC is its corresponding central angle, we can use the inscribed angle theorem to find the measure of angle AOC.
* **Formula:**  Central Angle = 2 * Inscribed Angle
* **Explanation:**  The formula states that the measure of the central angle is twice the measure of the inscribed angle. In this case, the inscribed angle is angle ABC, which measures 70 degrees.

If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"This problem is asking us to find the radius of the smaller circle, given that the radius of the larger circle is 4.

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant information.**

* The radius of the larger circle is 4. This is given in the problem.
* The smaller circle is inside the larger circle, and they share a point of intersection. This is shown in the image.

**Step 2: Visualize the relationship between the circles.**

* Imagine drawing a line segment from the center of the larger circle (P) to the point of intersection (Q). This line segment is also the radius of the larger circle.
* Now, imagine drawing a line segment from the center of the smaller circle (Q) to the point of intersection (Q). This line segment is the radius of the smaller circle.

**Step 3: Understand the relationship between the radii.**

* The radius of the larger circle is equal to the sum of the radius of the smaller circle and the distance between the centers of the two circles.

**Step 4: Apply the formula.**

* Let 'r' be the radius of the smaller circle.
* The distance between the centers of the two circles is equal to the radius of the larger circle minus the radius of the smaller circle (4 - r).
* Using the relationship we identified in Step 3, we can write the equation: 4 = r + (4 - r)

**Step 5: Solve for 'r'.**

* Simplify the equation: 4 = r + 4 - r

What is the $x$ component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3?",0.17,"The math problem in the image is asking us to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3. This means we need to calculate the total force acting on particle 3 in the horizontal direction, taking into account the forces from all other particles.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**

* **Force from particle 1:**  Particle 1 has a negative charge, and particle 3 has a negative charge. Since opposite charges attract, the force between them will be attractive and directed towards particle 1. This force will have both x and y components.
* **Force from particle 2:** Particle 2 has a positive charge, and particle 3 has a negative charge. Since opposite charges attract, the force between them will be attractive and directed towards particle 2. This force will only have an x-component.
* **Force from particle 4:** Particle 4 has a negative charge, and particle 3 has a negative charge. Since like charges repel, the force between them will be repulsive and directed away from particle 4. This force will only have an x-component.

**Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of each force using Coulomb's Law.**

Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is:

```
F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
```

Where:

* **q1** and **q2** are the magnitudes of the charges
* **r** is the distance between the charges

Let's calculate the magnitude of each force:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant triangles.**

* We can see that triangle ABC is a right triangle, with a right angle at D. 
* We are trying to find the length of AD, which is one of the legs of this right triangle.

**Step 2: Determine the lengths of the other sides of triangle ABC.**

* Looking at the grid, we can count the units to find the lengths of the sides:
    * AB = 4 units (from point A to point B, counting the grid squares)
    * BC = 3 units (from point B to point C, counting the grid squares)

**Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.**

* The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs). 
* Formula: a² + b² = c²

If PA = 8.0, then perimeter of △PCD is ()",16,"The math problem in the image asks us to find the perimeter of triangle PCD. 

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the key properties of the figure.**

* **Tangents:** PA and PB are tangents to circle O, meaning they touch the circle at exactly one point (A and B, respectively).
* **Tangent-Tangent Theorem:**  The two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. This means PA = PB = 8.0.
* **Tangent-Radius Theorem:** A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means OA is perpendicular to PA and OB is perpendicular to PB.

**Step 2:  Recognize the key geometric shapes.**

* **Right Triangles:**  Triangles OAP and OBP are right triangles because of the tangent-radius theorem.
* **Isosceles Triangles:** Triangles OAP and OBP are isosceles because OA = OB (radii of the same circle) and PA = PB (tangent-tangent theorem).

**Step 3:  Calculate the length of OC and OD.**

* **Pythagorean Theorem:** In right triangle OAP, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of OA (the radius of the circle):  
    *  a² + b² = c²
    *  OA² + PA² = OP²
    *  OA² + 8² = OP²
    *  OA² = OP² - 64
* **Since OA = OB, we can apply the same logic to triangle OBP and find that OB² = OP² - 64.**
* **Now, consider triangle OAC. It's a right triangle with OA as the radius and AC as a tangent. Using the Pythagorean theorem again:**
    *  OA² + AC² = OC²
    *  (OP² - 64) + AC² = OC²
    *  OC² = OP² - 64 + AC²
* **Similarly, in triangle OBD, we can find that OD² = OP² - 64 + BD².**

**Step 4:  Express the perimeter of triangle PCD in terms of known lengths.**

* **Perimeter of triangle PCD:**  PC + CD + PD
* **Since CD is a tangent to the circle, we can use the tangent-tangent theorem to say that CD = AC + BD.**
* **Therefore, the perimeter of triangle PCD is:**  PC + (AC + BD) + PD = (PC + AC) + (BD + PD) = PA + PB = 8 + 8 = 16.

**Final Answer:** The perimeter of triangle PCD is 16.

**Reasoning for the answer:** We have used the properties of tangents and the Pythagorean theorem to express the lengths of the sides of triangle PCD in terms of known lengths. This allows us to calculate the perimeter of the triangle directly.

* **Formula:**  ∠ACB = ∠ACD + ∠BCD
* **Explanation:**  The measure of the whole angle ACB is equal to the sum of the measures of its two parts, ACD and BCD.
* **Details from the image:**  We can see that CD is a line segment that divides angle ACB into two equal angles.

**Step 2: Find the measure of angle ACD.**

* **Operation:** We will use the fact that angles ACD and BCD are equal and that angle DBC is 54 degrees to find the measure of angle ACD.
* **Reasoning:**  Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle ACD is equal to angle BCD. We know that angle DBC is 54 degrees, and since angle BCD and angle DBC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees), we can find the measure of angle BCD.
* **Formula:**  ∠ACD = ∠BCD = 180° - ∠DBC
* **Explanation:**  Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. We know angle DBC is 54 degrees, so angle BCD must be 180 degrees minus 54 degrees.
* **Details from the image:**  We can see that angle DBC and angle BCD are adjacent angles that form a straight line.

**Step 3: Find the measure of angle ADB.**

* **Operation:** We will use the fact that BD is perpendicular to CD to find the measure of angle ADB.
* **Reasoning:**  Since BD is perpendicular to CD, angle BDC is a right angle, which measures 90 degrees. We know that angle ADB and angle BDC are supplementary angles.
* **Formula:**  ∠ADB = 180° - ∠BDC
* **Explanation:**  Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. We know angle BDC is 90 degrees, so angle ADB must be 180 degrees minus 90 degrees.
* **Details from the image:**  We can see that BD is perpendicular to CD, forming a right angle at point D.

**Step 4: Find the measure of angle ABD.**

* **Operation:** We will use the fact that angle A is equal to angle ABD to find the measure of angle ABD.

**Step 5: Find the measure of angle A.**

* **Operation:** We will use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find the measure of angle A.
* **Reasoning:**  The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees. We know the measures of angles ADB and ABD, and we can find the measure of angle A by subtracting the sum of those two angles from 180 degrees.
* **Formula:**  ∠A = 180° - ∠ADB - ∠ABD
* **Explanation:**  The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. We know the measures of angles ADB and ABD, so we can find the measure of angle A by subtracting the sum of those two angles from 180 degrees.
* **Details from the image:**  We can see that angles A, ADB, and ABD are the three interior angles of triangle ABD.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Understand the relationship between the areas of triangles ABE and ABC.**

* **Operation:** Visualizing the relationship between the triangles.
* **Reasoning:**  Since E is the midpoint of AD, line segment AE is half the length of line segment AD.  Also, since AD is the median of triangle ABC, line segment BD is equal to line segment CD.  Therefore, the base of triangle ABE (AE) is half the base of triangle ABC (AD), and the height of triangle ABE (the perpendicular distance from point B to line segment AD) is the same as the height of triangle ABC (the perpendicular distance from point C to line segment AD).

**Step 2: Apply the formula for the area of a triangle.**

* **Formula:** Area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height
* **Explanation:** This formula tells us that the area of a triangle is equal to half the product of its base and height.
* **Application:**  Let's denote the base of triangle ABE as 'b' and the height as 'h'.  Then, the area of triangle ABE is (1/2) * b * h = 2.  The base of triangle ABC is 2b, and the height is h.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2) * 2b * h = b * h.

**Step 3: Calculate the area of triangle ABC.**

* **Operation:**  Substituting the known value of the area of triangle ABE into the formula for the area of triangle ABC.
* **Reasoning:** We know that the area of triangle ABE is 2, which is equal to (1/2) * b * h.  Therefore, b * h = 4.  Since the area of triangle ABC is b * h, the area of triangle ABC is 4.

**Final Answer:** The area of triangle ABC is 4.

**Verification:** We can be absolutely sure the answer is correct because we have used the formula for the area of a triangle and the relationship between the areas of triangles ABE and ABC, which are based on the given information and geometric principles.

To solve this, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs).

**Step 1: Write out the Pythagorean Theorem.**

The Pythagorean Theorem is written as:  *a² + b² = c²*

Where:

* *a* and *b* represent the lengths of the legs of the right triangle.
* *c* represents the length of the hypotenuse.

**Step 2: Substitute the known values into the formula.**

In this problem, we know that:

* *a = 9* (one leg)
* *b = x* (the unknown leg)
* *c = 15* (the hypotenuse)

Substituting these values into the Pythagorean Theorem, we get:

* 9² + x² = 15²

**Step 3: Simplify the equation.**

* 81 + x² = 225

**Step 4: Isolate the variable (x²).**

To isolate *x²*, we need to subtract 81 from both sides of the equation:

* x² = 225 - 81

**Step 5: Simplify the equation.**

* x² = 144

**Step 6: Solve for x.**

To find *x*, we need to take the square root of both sides of the equation:

* √x² = √144

**Step 7: Simplify the equation.**

* x = 12

Therefore, the length of the unknown leg, *x*, is 12 units.

**We can be absolutely sure that the answer is correct because we used the Pythagorean Theorem, a fundamental principle in geometry that has been proven to be true for all right triangles.**  We also followed the steps of solving the equation correctly, ensuring that each step logically follows from the previous one.

* We can see that the side of $Q$ that is labeled with a length of 5 corresponds to the side of $Q'$ that is labeled with a length of $x$.

**Step 2: Set up a proportion.**

* The scale factor is the ratio of corresponding sides. We can set up a proportion to represent this:

**Step 3: Solve for x.**

* To solve for $x$, we can cross-multiply:

  $x \cdot x = 5 \cdot 15$

* Simplifying the equation:

  $x^2 = 75$

* Taking the square root of both sides:

  $x = \sqrt{75}$

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the key information.**

* We are given that AB = 6.
* We are given that the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13.
* We are given that line DE is the perpendicular bisector of line AB.

**Step 2: Understand the properties of a perpendicular bisector.**

* A perpendicular bisector is a line that intersects another line at a 90-degree angle and divides that line into two equal segments.
* Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

**Step 3: Use the perimeter information to find AC.**

* The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
* Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ACE is AC + CE + AE = 13.
* Since AD = DB = 3, we know that AE = AD + DE = 3 + DE.
* Substituting this into the perimeter equation, we get AC + CE + (3 + DE) = 13.
* Simplifying, we get AC + CE + DE = 10.

**Step 4: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find CE.**

* The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
* In right triangle CDE, CE is the hypotenuse, CD is one leg, and DE is the other leg.
* Therefore, CE² = CD² + DE².
* We know that CD = BC - BD = BC - 3.
* We can substitute this into the equation to get CE² = (BC - 3)² + DE².

**Step 5: Solve for BC.**

* We know that AC + CE + DE = 10.
* We also know that CE² = (BC - 3)² + DE².
* We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get AC + √((BC - 3)² + DE²) + DE = 10.
* We can then solve for BC using algebraic manipulation.

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the key information**

* We are given that ABCD is a parallelogram.
* We are given that line segment BE bisects angle ABC.
* We are given that line segment CF bisects angle BCD.
* We are given that AB = 3 and AD = 4.

**Step 2: Draw additional lines and label angles**

* Draw a line segment from point E to point F.
* Label the intersection of line segment BE and line segment AD as point E.
* Label the intersection of line segment CF and line segment AD as point F.
* Label the angle at point B as angle B.
* Label the angle at point C as angle C.
* Label the angle at point E as angle E.
* Label the angle at point F as angle F.

**Step 3: Use the angle bisector theorem**

* The angle bisector theorem states that if a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.
* In triangle ABE, line segment BE bisects angle B. Therefore, AE/ED = AB/BD.
* In triangle CDF, line segment CF bisects angle C. Therefore, CF/FD = CD/BD.

**Step 4: Substitute known values**

* We know that AB = 3 and AD = 4.
* Since ABCD is a parallelogram, we know that AB = CD = 3 and AD = BC = 4.
* Therefore, AE/ED = 3/BD and CF/FD = 3/BD.

**Step 5: Solve for BD**

* Since AE + ED = AD = 4, we can write AE = 4 - ED.
* Substituting this into the equation AE/ED = 3/BD, we get (4 - ED)/ED = 3/BD.
* Cross-multiplying, we get 4BD - BD*ED = 3ED.
* Simplifying, we get 4BD = 4ED.
* Therefore, BD = ED.

**Step 6: Solve for EF**

* Since BD = ED, we can substitute ED for BD in the equation CF/FD = 3/BD.
* This gives us CF/FD = 3/ED.
* Since CF + FD = CD = 3, we can write CF = 3 - FD.
* Substituting this into the equation CF/FD = 3/ED, we get (3 - FD)/FD = 3/ED.
* Cross-multiplying, we get 3ED - ED*FD = 3FD.
* Simplifying, we get 3ED = 4FD.
* Therefore, ED/FD = 4/3.
* Since EF = ED + FD, we can write EF = ED(1 + FD/ED).
* Substituting ED/FD = 4/3, we get EF = ED(1 + 3/4).
* Simplifying, we get EF = 7/4 * ED.
* Since BD = ED, we can write EF = 7/4 * BD.
* Since BD = 4, we get EF = 7/4 * 4 = 7.

**Final Answer:** The length of line segment EF is 7.

**Verification:** We can be absolutely sure that the answer is correct because we have used the angle bisector theorem and the properties of parallelograms to derive a series of equations that relate the lengths of the line segments in the diagram. By solving these equations, we have arrived at a value for EF that satisfies all of the given conditions.

* Finally, we are given that angle BOC is equal to 50 degrees.

**Step 2: Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.**

* We know that angle AOB is a straight angle, which means it measures 180 degrees.
* We can write this as: ∠AOB = 180°
* We can also see that angle AOB is made up of two smaller angles: angle AOE and angle EOB.
* Therefore, we can write: ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 180°

**Step 3: Use the fact that angles at a point add up to 360 degrees.**

* We know that angles at point O add up to 360 degrees.
* We can write this as: ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB + ∠BOC = 360°
* Since OD bisects angle AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.
* Therefore, we can simplify the equation to: 2∠AOD + ∠EOB + ∠BOC = 360°

**Step 4: Substitute the known values into the equation.**

* We know that ∠BOC = 50°.
* We can substitute this into the equation from Step 3: 2∠AOD + ∠EOB + 50° = 360°

**Step 5: Solve for ∠EOB.**

* First, subtract 50° from both sides of the equation: 2∠AOD + ∠EOB = 310°
* Next, we need to find the value of ∠AOD. We know that ∠AOD + ∠DOE = ∠AOE.
* Since ∠AOD = ∠DOE, we can write: 2∠AOD = ∠AOE.
* We can substitute this into the equation: ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 310°
* Finally, we can substitute the value of ∠AOE from Step 2: 180° + ∠EOB = 310°
* Subtracting 180° from both sides, we get: ∠EOB = 130°

**Therefore, the final answer is ∠EOB = 130°.**

* In our case, AC is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABC.
* Formula:  a² + b² = c²
* Where:
    * a = AB = 24 (one leg of the right triangle)
    * b = BC = 16 (the other leg of the right triangle)
    * c = AC (the hypotenuse)

**Step 3: Substitute the known values into the formula and solve for AC.**

* 24² + 16² = AC²
* 576 + 256 = AC²
* 832 = AC²
* AC = √832 
* AC ≈ 28.84

**Step 4: Recognize that AC and CD are parallel sides of the trapezoid.**

* Since AB and CD are parallel, and AC is perpendicular to both AB and CD, we can see that AC and CD form a rectangle.

**Step 5: Use the fact that opposite sides of a rectangle are equal to find the length of CD.**

* Since AC and CD are opposite sides of the rectangle, they have the same length.
* Therefore, CD = AC ≈ 28.84

**Final Answer:** The length of segment CD is approximately 28.84.

* **Reasoning:** The square is inscribed in the circle, meaning its corners touch the circle's circumference. The diagonal of the square passes through the center of the circle, making it the same length as the diameter of the circle.
* **Calculation:** Diameter = 2 * radius = 2 * 3√2 = 6√2

**Step 3: Find the side length of the square.**

* **Operation:** We will use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length of the square.
* **Reasoning:** The diagonal of the square divides it into two right triangles. We know the length of the diagonal (hypotenuse) and we want to find the length of a side (leg). The Pythagorean theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.
* **Formula:** a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
* **Explanation:** In this case, the diagonal of the square is the hypotenuse (c), and the side of the square is one of the legs (a or b). We can plug in the values we know and solve for the side length.
* **Calculation:** Let s be the side length of the square.
    * s² + s² = (6√2)²
    * 2s² = 72

**Step 1: Draw a diagram and label the given information.**

* We are given a triangle ABC with a point N on side BC.
* We are also given a point M inside the triangle, where AM bisects angle BAC and BM is perpendicular to AM.
* We are given that AB = 8 and MN = 2.

**Step 2: Use the fact that N is the midpoint of BC to find the length of BN and NC.**

* Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know that BN = NC.
* We are not given the length of BC, so we cannot determine the length of BN or NC.

**Step 3: Use the fact that AM bisects angle BAC to find the ratio of AB to AC.**

* Since AM bisects angle BAC, we know that angle BAM is equal to angle CAM.
* We can use the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the ratio of the lengths of the two sides of a triangle that are adjacent to the bisected angle is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the two segments that the bisector divides the opposite side into.
* In this case, the Angle Bisector Theorem tells us that AB/AC = BM/MC.

**Step 4: Use the fact that BM is perpendicular to AM to find the length of BM.**

* We are given that BM is perpendicular to AM, which means that triangle ABM is a right triangle.

* The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
* In this case, the hypotenuse is AB, which has a length of 8. One of the other sides is AM, which we do not know the length of. The other side is BM, which we are trying to find.
* So, we have the equation 8^2 = AM^2 + BM^2.
* We can rearrange this equation to solve for BM: BM^2 = 8^2 - AM^2.
* We do not know the length of AM, so we cannot solve for BM at this time.

**Step 5: Use the fact that MN = 2 to find the length of MC.**

* We are given that MN = 2.
* We know that BM is perpendicular to AM, so triangle BMN is a right triangle.
* We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of MC.
* The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
* In this case, the hypotenuse is BM, which we do not know the length of. One of the other sides is MN, which has a length of 2. The other side is MC, which we are trying to find.
* So, we have the equation BM^2 = 2^2 + MC^2.
* We do not know the length of BM, so we cannot solve for MC at this time.

**Step 6: Use the information we have gathered to solve for AC.**

* We know that AB/AC = BM/MC.

* We can simplify this equation by squaring both sides: 64/AC^2 = (8^2 - AM^2) / (BM^2 - 2^2).

* The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  
* Formula:  a² + b² = c²
    * Where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs of the right triangle, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.
* In our case, we know AB = 8 and OB = 10. We need to find OA, which is the radius of the circle.
* Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:
    * OA² + AB² = OB²

We are given that PA and PB are tangents to the circle, point A and B are the points of tangency, AC is the diameter of the circle, and angle P is 50 degrees.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant geometric relationships.**

* **Tangents and Radii:**  We know that a tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means that ∠OAB and ∠OBA are both right angles (90 degrees).
* **Angles in a Triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.

**Step 2: Apply the tangent-radius relationship.**

* **∠OAB = ∠OBA = 90°** (because tangents are perpendicular to radii).

**Step 3: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**

* **∠P + ∠OAB + ∠OBA = 180°** (sum of angles in triangle PAB)
* **50° + 90° + 90° = 180°** (substituting the known angle measures)

**Step 4: Identify the relationship between ∠ACB and ∠PAB.**

* **∠ACB and ∠PAB are supplementary angles.** This means they add up to 180 degrees. This is because they are opposite angles formed by intersecting lines (PA and CB).

**Step 5: Calculate ∠ACB.**

* **∠ACB + ∠PAB = 180°** (supplementary angles)
* **∠ACB + (180° - 50°) = 180°** (substituting ∠PAB = 180° - ∠P)
* **∠ACB = 50°** (solving for ∠ACB)

**Final Answer:** The size of ∠ACB is 50°.

* Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter diagonal.
* Since the longer diagonal is twice as long as the shorter diagonal, it will be represented by '2x'.

**Step 2: Apply the formula for the area of a rhombus**

* The area of a rhombus is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.

**Step 3: Substitute the given values into the formula**

* We know the area is 169 square millimeters, d1 = x, and d2 = 2x.

We are given the areas of two other squares, one with an area of 8 and the other with an area of 14. These squares are constructed on the sides of a right triangle, with the side of length 8 being one leg of the triangle and the side of length 14 being the hypotenuse. 

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Find the length of the other leg of the right triangle.**

* **Operation:** We will use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the missing leg.
* **Reasoning:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs). 
* **Formula:**  a² + b² = c² where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.
* **Explanation:** We know the length of the hypotenuse (c = 14) and one leg (a = 8). We need to find the length of the other leg (b). 
* **Calculation:** 
    * 8² + b² = 14²

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Draw a radius from the center of the circle to point C.**

* **Operation:** Drawing a line segment.
* **Reasoning:**  Drawing a radius from the center of the circle to a point on the circle creates a right triangle. This will help us use trigonometric ratios to find the length of chord AB.

**Step 2: Identify the right triangle formed.**

* **Operation:** Identifying a triangle.
* **Reasoning:** The radius we just drew, along with the chord AC and the line segment OC, form a right triangle.  We know this because the radius is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of tangency.

**Step 3: Label the sides of the right triangle.**

* **Operation:** Labeling sides.
* **Reasoning:**  We need to label the sides of the triangle to use trigonometric ratios.  The hypotenuse is the radius of the circle, which is 2. The side opposite angle C is AC, which is the chord we want to find. The side adjacent to angle C is OC, which is also a radius of the circle and therefore also has a length of 2.

**Step 4: Use the sine function to find the length of AC.**

* **Operation:** Using the sine function.
* **Reasoning:** The sine function is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle. We know the angle (30 degrees) and the hypotenuse (2), and we want to find the opposite side (AC).
* **Formula:** sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse
* **Explanation:**  In this case, θ = 30 degrees, opposite = AC, and hypotenuse = 2.  So, we can write the equation: sin(30°) = AC / 2.

**Step 5: Solve for AC.**

* **Operation:** Solving an equation.
* **Reasoning:** We know that sin(30°) = 1/2.  Substituting this into our equation, we get: 1/2 = AC / 2.  Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: AC = 1.

**Step 6: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AB.**

* **Operation:** Using the Pythagorean theorem.
* **Reasoning:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. We know the lengths of AC and OC, and we want to find the length of AB.
* **Formula:** a² + b² = c²
* **Explanation:** In this case, a = AC = 1, b = OC = 2, and c = AB.  So, we can write the equation: 1² + 2² = AB².

**Step 7: Solve for AB.**

* **Operation:** Solving an equation.
* **Reasoning:** Simplifying the equation, we get: 1 + 4 = AB².  Combining like terms, we get: 5 = AB².  Taking the square root of both sides, we get: AB = √5.

**Final Answer:** The length of chord AB is √5.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the angle relationship**

* **Operation:** Observing the image
* **Reasoning:** We need to figure out how the angles labeled $(4x + 11)^\circ$ and $(8x + 1)^\circ$ are related to each other.  Notice that these angles are on the same side of the transversal line and are inside the two lines $a$ and $b$. This means they are **same-side interior angles**.

**Step 2: Apply the Same-Side Interior Angles Theorem**

* **Operation:** Using the Same-Side Interior Angles Theorem
* **Reasoning:** The Same-Side Interior Angles Theorem states that if two lines are parallel, then the same-side interior angles are supplementary (they add up to $180^\circ$).  Since we want to find the value of $x$ that makes lines $a$ and $b$ parallel, we can use this theorem to set up an equation.
* **Formula:**  $(4x + 11)^\circ + (8x + 1)^\circ = 180^\circ$

**Step 3: Simplify the equation**

* **Operation:** Combining like terms
* **Reasoning:** We want to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to simplify the equation by combining the terms with $x$ and the constant terms.

**Step 1: Identify the formula for the area of a parallelogram.**

The area of a parallelogram is given by the formula:

Area = base × height

where:

* **base** is the length of any side of the parallelogram.
* **height** is the perpendicular distance between the base and the opposite side.

**Step 2: Identify the base and height of the parallelogram.**

In the image, we can see that AB is one of the sides of the parallelogram. We can use AB as the base. 

To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from point D to line AB. This perpendicular line will be the height of the parallelogram.

**Step 3: Calculate the height of the parallelogram.**

We know that ∠B = 30.0 degrees. Since AB is the base, we can consider triangle ABD. In this triangle, BD is the hypotenuse, AB is the adjacent side, and the perpendicular line from D to AB is the opposite side.

We can use the trigonometric function sine to find the height:

sin(∠B) = opposite / hypotenuse

sin(30.0°) = height / BD

We know that sin(30.0°) = 1/2. We also know that BD = BC = 9.0. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

We are given that the length of side $AB$ is $9x-1$ and the length of side $BC$ is $5x-0.5$.  We are also given that the length of side $AC$ is $4x+1$.  Since the triangle is isosceles, we know that two of the sides must be equal in length.  We can use this information to solve for the value of $x$ and then substitute that value back into the expression for $AC$ to find its length.

**Step 1: Set up an equation.**

We know that sides $AB$ and $BC$ are equal in length.  So, we can set up the following equation:

$9x-1 = 5x-0.5$

**Step 2: Solve for x.**

To solve for $x$, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.  We can do this by performing the following operations:

* **Subtract 5x from both sides:** 
  $9x - 1 - 5x = 5x - 0.5 - 5x$
  $4x - 1 = -0.5$

* **Add 1 to both sides:**
  $4x - 1 + 1 = -0.5 + 1$
  $4x = 0.5$

* **Divide both sides by 4:**
  $4x / 4 = 0.5 / 4$
  $x = 0.125$

**Step 3: Substitute the value of x into the expression for AC.**

Now that we know the value of $x$, we can substitute it into the expression for $AC$:

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant information.**

* We are given that triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at A.
* We are also given that triangles A'BC and AB'C are equilateral triangles with areas of 10 and 4, respectively.
* We need to find the area of triangle ABC'.

**Step 2: Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle.**

The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is:

Area = (√3 / 4) * side²

where ""side"" represents the length of one side of the equilateral triangle.

**Step 3: Calculate the side lengths of triangles A'BC and AB'C.**

* For triangle A'BC, we know the area is 10.  Let's plug this into the formula and solve for the side length:

10 = (√3 / 4) * side²

* Multiply both sides by 4:

40 = √3 * side²

* Divide both sides by √3:

40 / √3 = side²

* Take the square root of both sides:

√(40 / √3) = side

* Simplify the radical:

side = √(40√3 / 3)

* For triangle AB'C, we know the area is 4.  Let's plug this into the formula and solve for the side length:

4 = (√3 / 4) * side²

* Multiply both sides by 4:

16 = √3 * side²

* Divide both sides by √3:

16 / √3 = side²

* Take the square root of both sides:

√(16 / √3) = side

* Simplify the radical:

side = √(16√3 / 3)

**Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side AC.**

The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In triangle ABC, AC is the hypotenuse, and AB and BC are the other two sides.  We know the lengths of AB and BC from the previous steps:

AB = √(16√3 / 3)

BC = √(40√3 / 3)

* Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:

AC² = AB² + BC²

AC² = (√(16√3 / 3))² + (√(40√3 / 3))²

AC² = (16√3 / 3) + (40√3 / 3)

AC² = 56√3 / 3

* Take the square root of both sides:

AC = √(56√3 / 3)

**Step 5: Use the formula for the area of a triangle.**

The formula for the area of a triangle is:

Area = (1/2) * base * height

where ""base"" and ""height"" are the lengths of the two perpendicular sides of the triangle.

**Step 6: Calculate the area of triangle ABC'.**

* In triangle ABC', AC is the base, and BC' is the height.  We know the length of AC from the previous step:

AC = √(56√3 / 3)

* We also know that BC' is equal to the side length of triangle AB'C:

BC' = √(16√3 / 3)

* Plugging these values into the formula for the area of a triangle:

Area of ABC' = (1/2) * √(56√3 / 3) * √(16√3 / 3)

Area of ABC' = (1/2) * √(56√3 * 16√3 / 3 * 3)

Area of ABC' = (1/2) * √(896 * 3 / 9)

Area of ABC' = (1/2) * √(896 / 3)

Area of ABC' = (1/2) * √(298.67)

Area of ABC' = 8.64

3. **Understand the relationship between the radius and the maximum value of y:** The radius of the circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. Since the circle is centered at the origin, the maximum value of y will be equal to the radius of the circle.

4. **Substitute the value of the radius into the equation:** We know that the radius of the circle is 5, so the maximum value of y is 5.

Therefore, the maximum value of y is **5**. We can be absolutely sure this is correct because the radius of the circle is 5, and the maximum value of y is equal to the radius.

256,如图，△ABC中，AD平分∠BAC，AD交BC于点D，DE⊥AB，垂足为E，若DE＝3，AC＝4，则△ADC的面积为（）,6,"The math problem in the image asks us to find the area of triangle ADC. 

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant information.**

* We are given that DE = 3 and AC = 4.
* We know that DE is perpendicular to AB, meaning angle DEA is a right angle.
* We know that AD bisects angle BAC, meaning angle BAD is equal to angle CAD.

**Step 2: Recognize that triangle ADE is a right triangle.**

* We know that angle DEA is a right angle, and we are given the lengths of DE and AC. 
* This means we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AD.

**Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AD.**

* The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
* In triangle ADE, AD is the hypotenuse, DE is one leg, and AE is the other leg.
* Therefore, we can write: AD² = DE² + AE²
* We know DE = 3, but we don't know AE.  We need to find AE before we can solve for AD.

**Step 4: Recognize that triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC.**

* Since AD bisects angle BAC, we know that angle BAD is equal to angle CAD.
* We also know that angle DEA is a right angle, and angle ABC is a right angle.
* Therefore, triangles ADE and ABC have two pairs of congruent angles, making them similar triangles.

**Step 5: Use the similarity of triangles ADE and ABC to find AE.**

* Similar triangles have proportional sides.  This means that the ratio of corresponding sides in the two triangles is equal.
* We know that DE = 3 and AC = 4.  These are corresponding sides in triangles ADE and ABC, respectively.
* Therefore, we can write the proportion: DE/AC = AE/AB
* We don't know AB, but we can use the fact that triangles ADE and ABC are similar to find it.
* Since the ratio of corresponding sides is equal, we can also write: DE/AC = AD/BC
* We know DE = 3 and AC = 4.  We also know that AD is the hypotenuse of triangle ADE, and BC is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC.
* Therefore, we can write: 3/4 = AD/BC
* We can solve for BC by cross-multiplying: 3BC = 4AD
* We can then substitute this value of BC into the proportion DE/AC = AD/BC to get: 3/4 = AD/(3BC/4)
* Simplifying, we get: 3/4 = 4AD/3BC
* Cross-multiplying, we get: 9BC = 16AD
* We can now substitute this value of BC into the equation 3BC = 4AD to get: 3(16AD/9) = 4AD
* Simplifying, we get: 16AD/3 = 4AD
* Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 16AD = 12AD
* Subtracting 12AD from both sides, we get: 4AD = 0
* Dividing both sides by 4, we get: AD = 0
* This is not possible, as AD is a side of a triangle and cannot have a length of 0.  This means there is an error in our calculations.

**Step 6: Review our work and identify the error.**

* We made an error in Step 5 when we assumed that AD is the hypotenuse of triangle ADE.  AD is actually the hypotenuse of triangle ADC, not triangle ADE.
* We need to start over from Step 5, using the correct hypotenuse for each triangle.

**Step 5 (revised): Use the similarity of triangles ADE and ABC to find AE.**

* Similar triangles have proportional sides.  This means that the ratio of corresponding sides in the two triangles is equal.
* We know that DE = 3 and AC = 4.  These are corresponding sides in triangles ADE and ABC, respectively.
* Therefore, we can write the proportion: DE/AC = AE/AB
* We don't know AB, but we can use the fact that triangles ADE and ABC are similar to find it.
* Since the ratio of corresponding sides is equal, we can also write:",False,0,8.234408855438232,1467.0

We are given that the two chords AB and CD intersect at point E inside the circle, and we know the measures of two angles: ∠D = 35.0 degrees and ∠AEC = 105.0 degrees.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant angles and their relationships.**

* We are looking for ∠C.
* We know ∠D = 35.0 degrees.
* We know ∠AEC = 105.0 degrees.
* Notice that ∠AEC and ∠CED are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. This is because they form a straight line.

**Step 2: Calculate ∠CED.**

* **Operation:** Subtraction
* **Reasoning:** Since ∠AEC and ∠CED are supplementary angles, we can find ∠CED by subtracting ∠AEC from 180 degrees.
* **Formula:** ∠CED = 180° - ∠AEC
* **Applying the formula:** ∠CED = 180° - 105.0° = 75.0°

**Step 3: Identify the relevant triangle and its angles.**

* We are focusing on triangle CED.
* We know ∠D = 35.0 degrees.
* We just calculated ∠CED = 75.0 degrees.
* We are looking for ∠C, which is one of the angles in triangle CED.

**Step 4: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**

* **Operation:** Addition
* **Reasoning:** The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
* **Formula:** ∠C + ∠D + ∠CED = 180°
* **Applying the formula:** ∠C + 35.0° + 75.0° = 180°

**Step 5: Solve for ∠C.**

* **Operation:** Subtraction
* **Reasoning:** We can isolate ∠C by subtracting 35.0° and 75.0° from both sides of the equation.
* **Applying the formula:** ∠C = 180° - 35.0° - 75.0° = 70.0°

**Final Answer:** ∠C = 70.0 degrees.

**Verification:** We can be absolutely sure the answer is correct because we have applied the angle sum property of triangles, which is a fundamental geometric principle. We have also used the fact that supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees.

A line segment that is a secant of the circle intersects the chord at a point inside the circle.  The secant is divided into two segments, one of length 9 and the other of length x.  The problem asks us to find the value of x.

To solve this problem, we can use the Intersecting Secant Theorem.  This theorem states that if two secants intersect inside a circle, then the product of the segments of one secant is equal to the product of the segments of the other secant.

**Step 1:  Identify the segments of each secant.**

* The first secant is the line segment that is divided into two segments of length 9 and x.
* The second secant is the chord of the circle, which is divided into two segments of equal length, each of which is 12.25/2 = 6.125 units long.

**Step 2:  Apply the Intersecting Secant Theorem.**

The Intersecting Secant Theorem states that:

(segment 1 of secant 1) * (segment 2 of secant 1) = (segment 1 of secant 2) * (segment 2 of secant 2)

In this case, we can write this as:

9 * x = 6.125 * 6.125

**Step 3:  Solve for x.**

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.  We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 9:

x = (6.125 * 6.125) / 9

**Step 4:  Calculate the value of x.**

Using a calculator, we can find that:

x = 41.67 / 9

x = 4.63

We need to determine which of the given options cannot be the perimeter of this triangle.

To solve this, we need to understand the concept of the Triangle Inequality Theorem. This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the known sides**

The image shows a triangle with two sides labeled: one side measures 7 and the other measures 12.

**Step 2: Apply the Triangle Inequality Theorem**

We need to check if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Let's consider all possible combinations:

* **7 + 12 > x** (where x is the unknown third side)
* **7 + x > 12**
* **12 + x > 7**

**Step 3: Solve the inequalities**

* **7 + 12 > x**  This simplifies to **19 > x**. This means the third side (x) must be less than 19.
* **7 + x > 12** This simplifies to **x > 5**. This means the third side (x) must be greater than 5.
* **12 + x > 7** This simplifies to **x > -5**. This inequality is always true since the length of a side cannot be negative.

**Step 4: Determine the possible range for the third side**

Combining the results from Step 3, we know that the third side (x) must be greater than 5 and less than 19.

**Step 5: Calculate the possible perimeter**

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides.  Therefore, the perimeter (P) of this triangle can be calculated as:

* **P = 7 + 12 + x**

Since we know that 5 < x < 19, the perimeter must be within the following range:

* **P = 7 + 12 + 5 = 24**
* **P = 7 + 12 + 19 = 38**

Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle must be between 24 and 38.

Without knowing the specific options provided, we cannot definitively state which option is incorrect. However, we can confidently say that any option less than 24 or greater than 38 cannot be the perimeter of the triangle.

**Step 2: Find the side length of the equilateral triangle.**

* **Operation:**  Observation
* **Reasoning:**  Since ABCE is a square, we know that all sides are equal.  The side length of the square is 1, so the side length of the triangle (CE) is also 1.

* **Explanation:**  Alternate interior angles are angles that are on opposite sides of the transversal and inside the parallel lines.
* **Calculation:**  Angle 1 = Angle A = 32 degrees

**Step 4: Calculate the difference between angle 1 and angle 2.**

* **Operation:** We'll subtract the measure of angle 2 from the measure of angle 1.

We are also told that points M and N are chosen on sides BC and CD respectively, such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:  Reflect point A across line BC.**

* **Operation:** Reflection
* **Reasoning:** Reflecting point A across line BC will create a new point, let's call it A', such that line BC is the perpendicular bisector of AA'. This means that AA' is the shortest distance between point A and its reflection A'.
* **Explanation:**  The shortest distance between a point and a line is the perpendicular distance. By reflecting A across BC, we are essentially finding the point on the other side of BC that is closest to A.

**Step 2: Connect A' to points M and N.**

* **Operation:** Drawing lines
* **Reasoning:**  We want to analyze the relationship between the original triangle AMN and the new triangle A'MN.
* **Explanation:** By connecting A' to M and N, we create a new triangle A'MN that is congruent to triangle AMN. This is because the reflection preserves lengths and angles.

* **Operation:**  Analyzing the perimeter
* **Reasoning:** We are looking for the smallest possible perimeter of triangle AMN.
* **Explanation:** The perimeter of triangle AMN is AM + MN + NA. Since triangle A'MN is congruent to triangle AMN, the perimeter of triangle A'MN is also AM + MN + NA'.

    * A'M + A'N > MN

**Step 5:  Minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN.**

* **Operation:**  Minimizing the perimeter
* **Reasoning:** We want to find the smallest possible perimeter of triangle AMN.
* **Explanation:**  To minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, we need to minimize the sum of the three sides: AM + MN + NA.  Since AM + MN + NA = A'M + MN + NA', we can minimize the perimeter by minimizing A'M + A'N.  This occurs when points M and N are collinear with A' and A, meaning that A'M + A'N = A'A.

**Step 6:  Calculate the angles of triangle AMN.**

* **Operation:**  Calculating angles
* **Reasoning:** We are asked to find the sum of angles ∠AMN and ∠ANM.
* **Explanation:** Since A'M + A'N = A'A, we know that points M and N are collinear with A' and A. This means that angle A'MN is a straight angle (180 degrees).  Since angle A'MA is 120 degrees (given), angle AMN is 180 - 120 = 60 degrees.  Similarly, angle ANM is also 60 degrees.

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the given information.**

* We are given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF (△ABC≌△DEF). This means that all corresponding angles and sides of the two triangles are equal.
* We are also given that angle A is 22 degrees (∠A = 22°).
* We are given that CD bisects angle BCA (CD平分∠BCA). This means that angle BCD is equal to angle DCA.
* We are given that angle CGF is 88 degrees (∠CGF = 88°).

**Step 2: Use the fact that corresponding angles of congruent triangles are equal.**

Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, we know that angle A is equal to angle D (∠A = ∠D). Therefore, angle D is also 22 degrees (∠D = 22°).

**Step 3: Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.**

Angle CGF and angle CGE form a straight line. Therefore, the sum of these two angles is 180 degrees (∠CGF + ∠CGE = 180°). We know that angle CGF is 88 degrees, so we can solve for angle CGE:

∠CGE = 180° - ∠CGF = 180° - 88° = 92°

**Step 4: Use the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.**

Angle CGE, angle GCE, and angle E are the three angles in triangle CGE. Therefore, the sum of these three angles is 180 degrees (∠CGE + ∠GCE + ∠E = 180°). We know that angle CGE is 92 degrees, and we can find angle GCE by using the fact that CD bisects angle BCA:

∠GCE = ∠BCA / 2 = ∠A / 2 = 22° / 2 = 11°

Now we can solve for angle E:

∠E = 180° - ∠CGE - ∠GCE = 180° - 92° - 11° = 77°

**Final Answer:** The measure of angle E is 77 degrees (∠E = 77°).

**Step 1: Identify the relationship between angle BCD and angle BAD.**

* **Operation:**  Recognizing the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.
* **Reasoning:**  Angle BCD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BD. Angle AOD is a central angle that also intercepts arc BD.  
* **Formula:**  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted central angle.
* **Explanation:**  Since both angles intercept the same arc, we can use this formula to relate their measures.

**Step 2: Calculate the measure of angle BAD.**

* **Operation:**  Applying the formula from Step 1.

**Step 1: Identify the symmetrical points and lines.**

* **Symmetrical points:** A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ.
* **Symmetrical lines:** Line MP is the line of symmetry for points A and B, and line NQ is the line of symmetry for points A and C.

**Step 2: Understand the concept of symmetry.**

* **Symmetry:** When two points are symmetrical with respect to a line, the line bisects the line segment connecting the two points and forms a perpendicular angle with it.

**Step 3: Apply the concept of symmetry to the problem.**

* **Line MP:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, line MP bisects line segment AB and forms a perpendicular angle with it. This means ∠AMP = ∠BMP = 90°.
* **Line NQ:** Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, line NQ bisects line segment AC and forms a perpendicular angle with it. This means ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ = 90°.

The problem asks us to find the length of side RS, which is labeled as 2x+1, given that the triangle is equilateral.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Understand the definition of an equilateral triangle.**

An equilateral triangle is a triangle with all three sides equal in length.

**Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the equal sides.**

Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, we can set the expressions for the lengths of any two sides equal to each other.  Let's use the expressions for sides QR and QS:

4x = 6x - 1

**Step 3: Solve the equation for x.**

To solve for *x*, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.  We can do this by subtracting 4x from both sides:

4x - 4x = 6x - 1 - 4x

This simplifies to:

0 = 2x - 1

Next, we add 1 to both sides:

0 + 1 = 2x - 1 + 1

This simplifies to:

1 = 2x

Finally, we divide both sides by 2:

1/2 = 2x / 2

This gives us:

x = 1/2

**Step 4: Substitute the value of x into the expression for RS.**

Now that we know the value of *x*, we can substitute it into the expression for side RS, which is 2x + 1:

RS = 2(1/2) + 1

We can be absolutely sure that our answer is correct because we have used the definition of an equilateral triangle to set up an equation and solve for the value of *x*.  We then substituted this value back into the expression for RS to find its length.  Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, we know that the length of RS must be the same as the lengths of QR and QS, which are both equal to 2 when we substitute x = 1/2.

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the relationship between the lines.**

The image shows two parallel lines, l1 and l2. This is important because it tells us that certain angles formed by the lines and the triangle will have specific relationships.

**Step 2: Identify the angles formed by the lines and the triangle.**

The triangle intersects the lines l1 and l2, forming several angles. We are given that angle 1 measures 76 degrees. We are also given that the triangle contains a 30-degree angle.

**Step 3: Apply the concept of corresponding angles.**

Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection when a transversal intersects two parallel lines. In this case, angle 1 and the 30-degree angle in the triangle are corresponding angles. Since l1 and l2 are parallel, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, the 30-degree angle in the triangle is also 76 degrees.

**Step 4: Apply the angle sum property of triangles.**

The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.  We can write this as a formula:

Angle A + Angle B + Angle C = 180 degrees

In this case, we know two of the angles in the triangle: 76 degrees and 30 degrees. We can use the formula to find the third angle, which is angle 2:

76 degrees + 30 degrees + Angle 2 = 180 degrees

**Step 5: Solve for angle 2.**

Combining like terms, we get:

106 degrees + Angle 2 = 180 degrees

Subtracting 106 degrees from both sides, we get:

The measure of angle 2 is 74 degrees.

One of the chords is also a diameter of the circle. The problem asks us to find the value of x, given that one of the angles formed by the intersection of the chords is (4x + 50) degrees, another angle is 3x degrees, and the third angle is 30 degrees.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**

The problem involves the angles formed by intersecting chords inside a circle.  The relevant theorem is the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**, which states:

* **The measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to one-half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.**

**Step 2: Apply the theorem to the given information.**

* The angle formed by the intersection of the chords is (4x + 50) degrees.
* The intercepted arcs for this angle are the arc formed by the diameter (which is 180 degrees) and the arc intercepted by the other chord.
* The other angle formed by the intersection of the chords is 3x degrees.
* The intercepted arcs for this angle are the arc intercepted by the other chord and the arc intercepted by the diameter (which is 180 degrees).

**Step 3: Set up an equation using the theorem.**

According to the Intersecting Chords Theorem, we can write the following equation:

(4x + 50) = 1/2 * (180 + arc intercepted by the other chord)

**Step 4: Use the given information to simplify the equation.**

We know that the sum of the angles formed by the intersection of the chords is 360 degrees. Therefore, the third angle formed by the intersection of the chords is:

360 - (4x + 50) - 3x = 280 - 7x

This angle intercepts the same arc as the 3x degree angle.  Therefore, we can write:

3x = 1/2 * (180 + 280 - 7x)

**Step 5: Solve the equation for x.**

* 3x = 1/2 * (460 - 7x)
* 3x = 230 - 3.5x
* 6.5x = 230
* x = 230 / 6.5
* x = 35.38 (rounded to two decimal places)

**Step 6: Verify the answer.**

We can verify our answer by plugging x = 35.38 back into the original equation:

(4 * 35.38 + 50) = 1/2 * (180 + arc intercepted by the other chord)

191.52 = 1/2 * (180 + arc intercepted by the other chord)

383.04 = 180 + arc intercepted by the other chord

arc intercepted by the other chord = 203.04

We can also verify our answer by plugging x = 35.38 into the equation for the third angle:

280 - 7 * 35.38 = 280 - 247.66 = 32.34

The sum of the three angles is:

191.52 + 32.34 + 35.38 = 259.24

252,Consider the infinitely long chain of resistors shown below. What is the resistance between terminals a and b if R=1?,0.73,"The image shows an infinite chain of resistors, each with a resistance of R. The problem asks us to find the equivalent resistance between points a and b.

Here's how to solve this problem:

**Step 1:  Identify the repeating pattern**

The image shows a repeating pattern of resistors.  Each section of the chain consists of three resistors in parallel, followed by one resistor in series.

**Step 2:  Simplify the repeating pattern**

* **Parallel Resistors:** The three resistors in parallel have the same resistance, R.  To find the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel, we use the following formula:

   1/R_parallel = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + ...

   In this case, we have:

   1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R

   Therefore, the equivalent resistance of the three parallel resistors is:

   R_parallel = R/3

* **Series Resistors:** The equivalent resistance of resistors in series is simply the sum of the individual resistances.  So, the equivalent resistance of the parallel section and the series resistor is:

   R_equivalent = R_parallel + R = R/3 + R = 4R/3

**Step 3:  Represent the infinite chain as a simplified circuit**

We can now represent the infinite chain as a simplified circuit with a single equivalent resistance (4R/3) followed by the rest of the infinite chain.

**Step 4:  Set up an equation**

Let's call the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain R_total.  Since the chain is infinite, the resistance of the entire chain is the same as the resistance of the simplified circuit we just created.  This gives us the following equation:

   R_total = 4R/3 + R_total

**Step 5:  Solve for R_total**

Solving for R_total, we get:

   R_total - R_total = 4R/3
   0 = 4R/3
   R_total = 4R/3

**Step 6:  Substitute R = 1**

The problem states that R = 1.  Substituting this into our equation for R_total, we get:

   R_total = (4 * 1)/3 = 4/3

**Final Answer:** The equivalent resistance between terminals a and b is 4/3.

**Verification:**

We can be absolutely sure this answer is correct because we have shown that the equivalent resistance of the infinite chain is equal to the equivalent resistance of a single repeating section of the chain.  This means that the resistance of the chain remains constant, even as we add more repeating sections.  Therefore, our answer of 4/3 is the correct equivalent resistance for the entire infinite chain.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Find the measure of each interior angle of the hexagon.**

* **Operation:** We will use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon.
* **Reasoning:**  A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles. To find the measure of each interior angle, we need to know the sum of all the interior angles.
* **Formula:**  Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) * 180°, where n is the number of sides of the polygon.
* **Explanation:**  The formula works because we can divide any polygon into triangles by drawing diagonals from one vertex. The number of triangles formed is always two less than the number of sides of the polygon. Since each triangle has an angle sum of 180°, we multiply (n - 2) by 180° to get the total sum of interior angles.
* **Applying the formula:** In this case, n = 6 (number of sides of the hexagon). So, the sum of interior angles = (6 - 2) * 180° = 4 * 180° = 720°.
* **Finding the measure of each interior angle:** Since the hexagon is regular, each interior angle has the same measure. Therefore, each interior angle measures 720° / 6 = 120°.

**Step 2: Find the measure of angle ABO.**

* **Operation:** We will use the fact that the angles around point O form a complete circle.
* **Reasoning:**  Point O is the center of the hexagon, and lines OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, and OF divide the hexagon into six congruent triangles. Each of these triangles has a vertex at O, and the angles at O form a complete circle, which measures 360°.
* **Finding the measure of angle ABO:** Since there are six equal angles around point O, each angle measures 360° / 6 = 60°. Therefore, angle ABO measures 60°.

**Step 3: Find the value of x.**

* **Operation:** We will use the fact that the angles in triangle ABO add up to 180°.
* **Reasoning:**  Triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle because OA = OB (radii of the hexagon). Therefore, angles BAO and ABO are equal.
* **Finding the value of x:**  We know that angle ABO = 60° and angle BAO = ABO = 60°. Therefore, x = angle ABO + angle BAO = 60° + 60° = 120°.

**Final Answer:** The value of x is 120°.

**Verification:** We can be absolutely sure the answer is correct because we have used the properties of regular polygons, the sum of interior angles of a polygon, and the fact that angles around a point add up to 360°.

The triangle has vertices at points $C$, $D$, and $E$.  The angle at point $C$ is labeled $(5x-12)^\circ$, and the angle at point $E$ is labeled $3x^\circ$.

Here are the steps to solve for $x$:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant geometric relationship.**

The problem involves a triangle inscribed in a circle.  A key geometric relationship for inscribed triangles is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In this case, the angle at point $C$ intercepts the entire circle, which is a $360^\circ$ arc.

**Step 2: Apply the relationship to set up an equation.**

The measure of the angle at point $C$ is $(5x-12)^\circ$, and it intercepts a $360^\circ$ arc.  Therefore, we can write the equation:

$(5x-12)^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 360^\circ$

**Step 3: Simplify the equation.**

The right side of the equation simplifies to $180^\circ$.  So, we have:

$(5x-12)^\circ = 180^\circ$

**Step 4: Solve for $x$.**

To solve for $x$, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.  First, add $12^\circ$ to both sides:

$5x^\circ = 192^\circ$

Then, divide both sides by $5$:

$x = 38.4$

**Final Answer:**

Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\boxed{38.4}$.

**Verification:**

We can be absolutely sure that our answer is correct by plugging $x = 38.4$ back into the original equation and verifying that it holds true.  

* The angle at point $C$ is $(5x-12)^\circ = (5 \cdot 38.4 - 12)^\circ = 180^\circ$.
* The angle at point $E$ is $3x^\circ = 3 \cdot 38.4^\circ = 115.2^\circ$.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always $180^\circ$, we can check that $180^\circ + 115.2^\circ + (5x-12)^\circ = 180^\circ$ when $x = 38.4$.  This confirms that our answer is correct.

**Final Answer:** The measure of angle ∠CTD is 90°.

**Verification:** We can be absolutely sure the answer is correct because we used a well-established geometric theorem (the tangent-chord angle theorem) and applied it correctly.  The theorem guarantees that the measure of a tangent-chord angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc, and in this case, the intercepted arc is a semicircle, which always measures 180 degrees.

757,Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.,7.2,"The image shows a circle with two secant lines intersecting outside the circle. One secant line has a segment length of 15 inside the circle and a segment length of 12 outside the circle. The other secant line has a segment length of 8 outside the circle and a segment length of *x* inside the circle. The problem asks us to find the value of *x*, the length of the segment inside the circle, to the nearest tenth.

To solve this problem, we can use the **Secant-Secant Theorem**, which states that the product of the lengths of the segments of one secant line is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the other secant line.

**Step 1: Identify the segments of each secant line.**

* **Secant line 1:** The segment inside the circle is 15, and the segment outside the circle is 12.
* **Secant line 2:** The segment inside the circle is *x*, and the segment outside the circle is 8.

**Step 2: Apply the Secant-Secant Theorem.**

The theorem states: (segment 1 inside) * (segment 1 outside) = (segment 2 inside) * (segment 2 outside)

Plugging in the values from the image, we get: 15 * 12 = *x* * 8

**Step 3: Simplify the equation.**

180 = 8*x

**Step 4: Solve for *x*.**

Divide both sides of the equation by 8: 180 / 8 = *x*

**Step 5: Calculate the answer to the nearest tenth.**

*x* = 22.5

**Final Answer:** *x* = 22.5

We can be absolutely sure that the answer is correct because we used the Secant-Secant Theorem, which is a proven geometric principle. The theorem guarantees that the product of the segments of one secant line will always be equal to the product of the segments of the other secant line when they intersect outside the circle.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the relationship between angle ABD and angle ACB.**

* **Operation:** Recognizing the relationship between inscribed angles and their intercepted arcs.
* **Reasoning:**  Angle ABD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AD. Angle ACB is also an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc AD.  
* **Formula:**  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Explanation:**  Since both angles intercept the same arc, they must have the same measure.

**Step 2: Determine the measure of angle ACB.**

* **Operation:**  Applying the relationship identified in Step 1.
* **Reasoning:**  We know that angle ABD measures 50 degrees. Since angle ACB intercepts the same arc as angle ABD, it must also measure 50 degrees.

**Step 3: Identify the relationship between angle ACB and angle BCD.**

* **Operation:** Recognizing the relationship between angles in a triangle.
* **Reasoning:**  Angles ACB and BCD are two angles in triangle BCD.
* **Formula:**  The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.

**Step 4: Calculate the measure of angle BCD.**

* **Operation:**  Applying the formula from Step 3.
* **Reasoning:**  We know that angle ACB measures 50 degrees. We also know that angle CBD is a right angle (90 degrees) because AB is the diameter of the circle and any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.
* **Calculation:**  ∠BCD = 180° - ∠ACB - ∠CBD = 180° - 50° - 90° = 40°

**Final Answer:** The degree of ∠BCD is 40°.

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the relevant information.**

* We are given that $m \widehat {PQR} = 98$. This means the measure of the major arc PQR is 98 degrees.
* We know that the measure of a circle is 360 degrees.

**Step 2: Understand the relationship between major and minor arcs.**

* A major arc is an arc that measures greater than 180 degrees.
* A minor arc is an arc that measures less than 180 degrees.
* A major arc and its corresponding minor arc together make up the entire circle.

**Step 3: Apply the relationship to find the measure of the minor arc.**

* We can find the measure of the minor arc PQ by subtracting the measure of the major arc PQR from the total measure of the circle:

  $m \widehat {PQ} = 360^\circ - m \widehat {PQR}$

**Step 4: Substitute the known value and solve.**

* We know that $m \widehat {PQR} = 98^\circ$. Substituting this into the equation from Step 3, we get:

  $m \widehat {PQ} = 360^\circ - 98^\circ$

* Simplifying the equation, we get:

  $m \widehat {PQ} = 262^\circ$

**Final Answer:**

The measure of the minor arc PQ, $m \widehat {PQ}$, is 262 degrees.

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the given information.**

* We are given that F is the intersection of the angle bisectors CD and BE of triangle ABC.
* We are also given that CG is perpendicular to AB, meaning angle CGB is a right angle (90 degrees).
* We know that angle ACG is 32 degrees.

**Step 2: Use the angle bisector theorem.**

* The angle bisector theorem states that if a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.
* In our case, CD bisects angle ACB, so we can apply the angle bisector theorem to triangle ABC.
* This means that AD/DB = AC/BC.

**Step 3: Use the fact that CG is perpendicular to AB.**

* Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know that angle CGB is a right angle (90 degrees).
* This means that triangle CGB is a right triangle.

**Step 4: Use the angle sum property of triangles.**

* The angle sum property of triangles states that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
* In triangle CGB, we know that angle CGB is 90 degrees and angle ACG is 32 degrees.
* Therefore, angle CBG = 180 - 90 - 32 = 58 degrees.

**Step 5: Use the fact that F is the intersection of the angle bisectors.**

* Since F is the intersection of the angle bisectors CD and BE, we know that angle BFC is half the sum of angles BAC and ABC.
* This is because the angle bisectors divide each angle into two equal parts.

**Step 6: Use the angle sum property of triangles again.**

* In triangle ABC, we know that angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180 degrees.
* We also know that angle ACB is twice angle ACG, which is 32 degrees.
* Therefore, angle ACB = 2 * 32 = 64 degrees.
* This means that angle BAC + angle ABC = 180 - 64 = 116 degrees.

**Step 7: Calculate angle BFC.**

* We know that angle BFC is half the sum of angles BAC and ABC, which is 116 degrees.
* Therefore, angle BFC = 116 / 2 = 58 degrees.

**Final Answer:** The measure of angle BFC is 58 degrees.

**How to be sure the answer is correct:**

* We have used the angle bisector theorem, the angle sum property of triangles, and the fact that CG is perpendicular to AB to arrive at our answer.
* These are all well-established geometric principles that are always true.
* Therefore, we can be absolutely sure that our answer is correct.

**Step 1: Identify the type of polygon.**

The image shows a regular pentagon, which means all sides are equal and all angles are equal.

**Step 2: Calculate the measure of each interior angle of the pentagon.**

* **Formula:**  Sum of interior angles of a polygon = (n - 2) * 180°, where n is the number of sides.
* **Explanation:** This formula tells us the total measure of all the interior angles of any polygon. We use it to find the measure of each individual angle in a regular polygon.
* **Application:** In this case, n = 5 (since it's a pentagon). So, the sum of the interior angles of the pentagon is (5 - 2) * 180° = 540°.
* **Calculation:** Since all angles in a regular pentagon are equal, each angle measures 540° / 5 = 108°.

**Step 3: Determine the relationship between angle ADE and the interior angle of the pentagon.**

* **Observation:** Angle ADE is an exterior angle of the pentagon, formed by extending one side of the pentagon (DE).
* **Property:** An exterior angle of a polygon is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

**Step 4: Calculate the measure of angle ADE.**

* **Application:** In this case, the two non-adjacent interior angles to angle ADE are angle A and angle B.
