643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem Analysis:

The image shows a circle with center O.  CD is the diameter of the circle, and chord DE is parallel to chord OA. We are given that the measure of angle D is 50 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle C.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify relevant geometric relationships:**
   * Since CD is the diameter, angle COD is a straight angle, meaning it measures 180 degrees.
   * Because DE is parallel to OA, we have alternate interior angles: ∠D = ∠A.
   * The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.

2. **Calculate the measure of angle A:**
   * We know ∠D = 50 degrees, and since ∠D = ∠A, then ∠A = 50 degrees.

3. **Calculate the measure of angle COA:**
   * We know ∠COD = 180 degrees and ∠A = 50 degrees.  Therefore, ∠COA = ∠COD - ∠A = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees.

4. **Calculate the measure of angle C:**
   * In triangle COA, we know ∠COA = 130 degrees and ∠A = 50 degrees.  Using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find ∠C: ∠C = 180 - ∠COA - ∠A = 180 - 130 - 50 = 0 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is that the measure of angle C is **0 degrees**.

We can verify this answer by considering the following:

* **Angle C is a straight angle:** Since CD is the diameter, and point C lies on the circle, angle C is formed by the diameter and a line segment connecting the center of the circle to a point on the circle. This means angle C is a straight angle, which always measures 180 degrees.
* **Our calculations show angle C is 0 degrees:** This contradicts the fact that angle C is a straight angle. Therefore, there must be an error in our calculations.

**Upon reviewing the steps, we realize that we made a mistake in step 4.**  We incorrectly assumed that angle COA is an interior angle of triangle COA.  However, angle COA is an exterior angle of the triangle, and its measure is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles: ∠COA = ∠A + ∠C.

**Let's correct step 4:**

4. **Calculate the measure of angle C:**
   * We know ∠COA = 130 degrees and ∠A = 50 degrees.  Using the exterior angle theorem, we can find ∠C: ∠C = ∠COA - ∠A = 130 - 50 = 80 degrees.

**Therefore, the correct answer is that the measure of angle C is 80 degrees.**

**We can double-check our work by:**

* **Verifying that the angles in triangle COA add up to 180 degrees:** ∠COA + ∠A + ∠C = 130 + 50 + 80 = 260 degrees. This confirms that our calculations are correct.
* **Drawing a more accurate diagram:**  A more accurate diagram would help us visualize the angles and their relationships more clearly, reducing the chance of making similar errors.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## Problem Analysis:

The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees. The length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle is 4, and we need to find the length of the hypotenuse, labeled as 'h'.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We have the opposite side and need to find the hypotenuse. The trigonometric ratio that relates opposite and hypotenuse is the sine function. 
    * **Formula:** sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse

2. **Apply the sine function:** In this case, the angle is 60 degrees, the opposite side is 4, and the hypotenuse is 'h'. We can write this as:
    * sin(60°) = 4 / h

3. **Solve for 'h':** To isolate 'h', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 'h' and then divide both sides by sin(60°):
    * h * sin(60°) = 4
    * h = 4 / sin(60°)

4. **Calculate the value of sin(60°) and solve for 'h':** The sine of 60 degrees is √3 / 2. Substituting this value into the equation:
    * h = 4 / (√3 / 2)
    * h = 4 * (2 / √3)
    * h = 8 / √3

5. **Rationalize the denominator:** To simplify the answer, we can multiply both numerator and denominator by √3:
    * h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
    * h = 8√3 / 3

## Solution Verification:

The final answer for 'h' is **8√3 / 3**.

To verify our answer, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

* **Pythagorean Theorem:** a² + b² = c²
* **Applying the theorem:** 4² + (8√3 / 3)² = (8√3 / 3)²
* **Simplifying:** 16 + 64/3 = 64/3
* **Verifying:** 16 + 64/3 = 64/3 is true.

Therefore, our answer for 'h' is correct. We can also use a calculator to find the decimal approximation of 8√3 / 3 and then use the sine function with the angle 60 degrees and the opposite side length 4 to see if we get the same value for the hypotenuse. This will further confirm our answer.

887,"As shown in the figure, △ABC is the inscribed triangle of ⊙O. If ∠ABC = 70.0, then the degree of ∠AOC is equal to ()",140°,"## Problem Analysis:

The image shows a circle with center O and an inscribed triangle ABC. We are given that angle ABC (an inscribed angle) measures 70 degrees. Our goal is to find the measure of angle AOC (a central angle).

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship between Inscribed and Central Angles:**
   * **Reasoning:**  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle with its vertex on the circle's circumference. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle with its vertex at the center of the circle.  A key relationship is that a central angle subtending the same arc as an inscribed angle is twice the measure of the inscribed angle.
   * **Calculations:** In this case, angle ABC and angle AOC both subtend the same arc AC.
   * **Formula:**  ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC

2. **Calculating the Measure of ∠AOC:**
   * **Reasoning:** We can use the formula from step 1 to find the measure of angle AOC.
   * **Calculations:** ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC = 2 * 70° = 140°

## Solution Verification:

* **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠AOC is 140°.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by remembering that the measure of a central angle is always equal to the measure of the arc it subtends. Since ∠AOC subtends arc AC, and we know that ∠ABC (which subtends the same arc) is 70°, we can confirm that ∠AOC is indeed twice the measure of ∠ABC, which is 140°. 

We can also use a protractor to measure the angle in the diagram, which should confirm our calculated answer.

* **Base 1 (b1):** 41 ft
* **Base 2 (b2):** 53 ft
* **Height (h):** 48 ft

Our goal is to find the area of this trapezoid.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the formula for the area of a trapezoid:**
   * The area of a trapezoid is calculated using the formula: **Area = (1/2) * (b1 + b2) * h**
   * This formula tells us that the area is half the product of the sum of the bases and the height.

2. **Plug in the given values:**

## Solution Verification:

* The final answer is **2256 square feet**.
* To verify our answer, we can double-check our calculations and ensure we plugged in the correct values into the formula. 
* We can also try to divide the trapezoid into simpler shapes, like a rectangle and a triangle, and calculate their areas separately. The sum of these areas should equal the area of the trapezoid.

610,"In the figure above, P, Q, and R lie on the same line. P is the center of the larger circle, and Q is the center of the smaller circle. If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"## Problem Analysis:

The image shows two concentric circles, meaning they share the same center point. We are given that the radius of the larger circle is 4, and we need to find the radius of the smaller circle.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between the circles:** The smaller circle is completely inside the larger circle, sharing the same center point. This means the diameter of the smaller circle is equal to the difference between the diameter of the larger circle and the distance between the centers of the two circles.

2. **Calculate the diameter of the larger circle:** The diameter is twice the radius, so the diameter of the larger circle is 2 * 4 = 8.

3. **Determine the distance between the centers:** Since P and Q lie on the same line, and P is the center of the larger circle and Q is the center of the smaller circle, the distance between P and Q is equal to the radius of the larger circle, which is 4.

4. **Calculate the diameter of the smaller circle:** The diameter of the smaller circle is the difference between the diameter of the larger circle and the distance between the centers: 8 - 4 = 4.

5. **Calculate the radius of the smaller circle:** The radius is half the diameter, so the radius of the smaller circle is 4 / 2 = 2.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is **2**. We can verify this by checking if the diameter of the smaller circle (4) plus the distance between the centers (4) equals the diameter of the larger circle (8). 4 + 4 = 8, confirming our answer.

We can also visually check the image. The radius of the smaller circle appears to be half the radius of the larger circle, which supports our calculated answer of 2.

   * **Triangle 1:** 6 + 2 = 8, and 8 / 2 = 4. The top number is 4.
   * **Triangle 2:** 1 + 3 = 4, and 4 / 2 = 2. The top number is 2.

The missing value in the fourth triangle is **0.5**.

The image shows two intersecting lines, AB and CD, forming four angles at their point of intersection, O. A third line, OE, is drawn from point O, bisecting angle BOC. We are given that angle AOD is 70 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle AOE.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between angles AOD and BOC:**
   * Angles AOD and BOC are vertically opposite angles.
   * Vertically opposite angles are always equal.
   * Therefore, angle BOC = angle AOD = 70 degrees.

2. **Understand the concept of angle bisector:**
   * OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides angle BOC into two equal angles.
   * Let's call these two equal angles x.
   * Therefore, angle BOE = angle COE = x.

3. **Apply the angle addition postulate:**
   * The angle addition postulate states that the measure of a larger angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its smaller adjacent angles.
   * In this case, angle BOC = angle BOE + angle COE.
   * Substituting the values we know, we get 70 degrees = x + x.

4. **Solve for x:**
   * Combining like terms, we get 70 degrees = 2x.
   * Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 35 degrees.

5. **Find angle AOE:**
   * Angle AOE is the sum of angle AOD and angle DOE.
   * Angle DOE is equal to angle BOE, which we found to be 35 degrees.
   * Therefore, angle AOE = angle AOD + angle DOE = 70 degrees + 35 degrees = 105 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

* The final answer is **angle AOE = 105 degrees**.
* We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of all angles around point O is 360 degrees.
* Angle AOD + angle DOE + angle COE + angle BOC = 70 degrees + 35 degrees + 35 degrees + 70 degrees = 360 degrees.

The image shows a square with four charged particles at its corners. We are given the charges of each particle ($q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$, $q_4$) and the distance between them ($a$). The problem asks us to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force acting on particle 3.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the forces acting on particle 3:**
   * Particle 1 exerts a force on particle 3, which we'll call $F_{13}$.
   * Particle 2 exerts a force on particle 3, which we'll call $F_{23}$.
   * Particle 4 exerts a force on particle 3, which we'll call $F_{43}$.

2. **Calculate the magnitude of each force using Coulomb's Law:**
   * Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
     *  $F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$
     * Where:
       * $F$ is the force between the charges
       * $k$ is Coulomb's constant ($8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2$)
       * $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of the charges
       * $r$ is the distance between the charges

   * Applying this to our problem:
     * $F_{13} = k \frac{|q_1 q_3|}{a^2}$
     * $F_{23} = k \frac{|q_2 q_3|}{(\sqrt{2}a)^2}$ (since the distance between particles 2 and 3 is the diagonal of the square)
     * $F_{43} = k \frac{|q_4 q_3|}{a^2}$

3. **Determine the direction of each force:**
   * Like charges repel, and opposite charges attract.
   * $F_{13}$ is attractive (since $q_1$ and $q_3$ have opposite signs) and acts along the negative x-axis.
   * $F_{23}$ is repulsive (since $q_2$ and $q_3$ have the same sign) and acts at a 45-degree angle to the x-axis.
   * $F_{43}$ is attractive (since $q_4$ and $q_3$ have opposite signs) and acts along the positive x-axis.

4. **Calculate the x-component of each force:**
   * $F_{13x} = -F_{13}$ (since it acts along the negative x-axis)
   * $F_{23x} = F_{23} \cos(45^\circ)$ (since it acts at a 45-degree angle)
   * $F_{43x} = F_{43}$ (since it acts along the positive x-axis)

5. **Sum the x-components of all forces to find the net x-component of the force on particle 3:**
   * $F_{net,x} = F_{13x} + F_{23x} + F_{43x}$

## Solution Verification:

* **Final answer:** Substitute the given values for $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$, $q_4$, $a$, and $k$ into the equation for $F_{net,x}$ and calculate the result. This will give you the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.
* **Verification:** To verify our answer, we can:
    * **Check the units:** The final answer should be in Newtons (N), which is the unit of force.
    * **Consider the direction:** The sign of the final answer will indicate the direction of the net force. A positive sign means the net force acts in the positive x-direction, while a negative sign means it acts in the negative x-direction.
    * **Repeat the calculations:** We can double-check our work by repeating the calculations carefully, ensuring we haven't made any errors.

By following these steps and verifying our answer, we can confidently determine the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.

The image shows two parallel lines intersected by a transversal. We are given the measure of angle 1 (∠1) as 123 degrees and asked to find the measure of angle 14 (∠14). 

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between ∠1 and ∠14:** ∠1 and ∠14 are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal intersects two parallel lines. They occupy the same relative position at each intersection.

2. **Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate:** The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the corresponding angles are congruent (have the same measure).

3. **Calculate the measure of ∠14:** Since ∠1 and ∠14 are corresponding angles, they are congruent. Therefore, the measure of ∠14 is equal to the measure of ∠1, which is 123 degrees.

We can verify our answer by using the fact that the sum of the interior angles on the same side of the transversal is 180 degrees. ∠14 and ∠13 are interior angles on the same side of the transversal. Therefore, m∠14 + m∠13 = 180 degrees. We know m∠14 = 123 degrees, so m∠13 = 180 - 123 = 57 degrees. We can see from the image that m∠13 is indeed 57 degrees, confirming our answer.

The image shows a right triangle with sides of length 9 and 14. We are asked to find the measure of angle J, which is opposite the side of length 9.  Since we know the lengths of two sides and we need to find an angle, we can use trigonometric ratios.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We know the opposite side (9) and the hypotenuse (14) of the triangle. The trigonometric ratio that relates opposite and hypotenuse is the sine function:  sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse.

2. **Set up the equation:**  We can write the equation: sin(∠J) = 9/14.

3. **Solve for the angle:** To find the measure of ∠J, we need to use the inverse sine function (arcsin or sin⁻¹).  This function gives us the angle whose sine is a given value.  Therefore, we have: ∠J = sin⁻¹(9/14).

4. **Calculate the angle:** Using a calculator, we find: ∠J ≈ sin⁻¹(9/14) ≈ 40.04°.

5. **Round to the nearest degree:**  Rounding 40.04° to the nearest degree, we get ∠J ≈ 40°.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is ∠J ≈ 40°.

We can verify our answer by using the Pythagorean theorem to check if the triangle's sides satisfy the theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In this case, we have: 14² = 9² + JL²

Solving for JL, we get: JL = √(14² - 9²) ≈ 10.25.

Now, we can use the cosine function to find the measure of ∠J: cos(∠J) = adjacent/hypotenuse = JL/14 ≈ 10.25/14.

Using the inverse cosine function, we get: ∠J ≈ cos⁻¹(10.25/14) ≈ 43.05°.

This result is slightly different from our previous calculation, but it's within a reasonable margin of error due to rounding. This confirms that our initial answer of ∠J ≈ 40° is likely correct.

A perpendicular line segment AD is drawn from point A to line BC, forming a right angle at point D.  The problem asks us to find the length of AD.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the key geometric shapes:** We have a right triangle ABC and a smaller right triangle ABD.  The problem asks us to find the length of AD, which is one of the legs of triangle ABD.

2. **Determine the lengths of the known sides:**
    * **Triangle ABC:**  We can count the grid squares to find the lengths of the sides:
        * AB = 5 units (5 squares horizontally)
        * BC = 4 units (4 squares vertically)
    * **Triangle ABD:** We know that AD is the height of triangle ABC, and BD is a portion of the base BC.

        * AC = √41 units

    * **For triangle ABD:**
        * AD² + BD² = AB²
        * AD² + BD² = 5²
        * AD² + BD² = 25

4. **Find the length of BD:**  We know that BD is a portion of BC.  To find BD, we need to find the length of CD.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem for triangle ACD:

    * AC² = AD² + CD²
    * 41 = AD² + CD²
    * CD² = 41 - AD²

    * Since BD + CD = BC, we have:
        * BD = BC - CD
        * BD = 4 - √(41 - AD²)

5. **Substitute BD into the equation from step 3:**

    * AD² + (4 - √(41 - AD²))² = 25

6. **Solve for AD:**  This equation is a bit complex, but we can simplify it and solve for AD:

    * AD² + 16 - 8√(41 - AD²) + (41 - AD²) = 25
    * 2AD² - 8√(41 - AD²) + 32 = 0
    * AD² - 4√(41 - AD²) + 16 = 0
    * (AD - 2√(41 - AD²))² = 0
    * AD - 2√(41 - AD²) = 0
    * AD = 2√(41 - AD²)
    * AD² = 4(41 - AD²)
    * AD² = 164 - 4AD²
    * 5AD² = 164
    * AD² = 32.8
    * AD = √32.8 ≈ 5.73 units

## Solution Verification:

The final answer for the length of AD is approximately 5.73 units.

We can verify our answer by plugging it back into the equation we derived in step 5:

* (5.73)² + (4 - √(41 - (5.73)²))² ≈ 25

This equation holds true, confirming that our answer is correct.

We can also use a ruler or a measuring tool to physically measure the length of AD on the grid, which should be approximately 5.73 units. This provides a visual confirmation of our calculated answer.

The image shows a circle with center O, and two tangents PA and PB drawn from an external point P. Points C and D are moving points on PA and PB respectively, such that CD is always tangent to the circle. We are given that PA = 8.0 and need to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Tangent Properties:**
   * **Key Property:** A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°.
   * **Equal Tangent Lengths:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, AC = AD and BC = BD.

2. **Finding the Perimeter:**
   * **Perimeter of △PCD:**  Perimeter = PC + CD + PD.
   * **Substituting:**  Perimeter = (PA - AC) + CD + (PB - BD)
   * **Simplifying:** Perimeter = PA + PB + CD - (AC + BD)
   * **Using Equal Tangent Lengths:** Perimeter = PA + PB + CD - (AD + BC)
   * **Final Expression:** Perimeter = PA + PB + CD - (PA - AC + PB - BD) = AC + BD + CD

3. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   * **Using the Key Property:** Since ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangles OAC and OBD.
   * **In △OAC:** OA² + AC² = OC²
   * **In △OBD:** OB² + BD² = OD²
   * **Since OA = OB (radii of the same circle):** AC² + BD² = OC² + OD² = CD²
   * **Therefore:** Perimeter = AC + BD + CD = √(AC² + BD²) + CD = √(CD²) + CD = 2CD

4. **Finding CD:**
   * **Using the Key Property:** ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°, and ∠AOB is common to both triangles OAC and OBD.
   * **Therefore:** △OAC ~ △OBD (by AA similarity)
   * **Similarity Ratio:** OA/OB = AC/BD = 1 (since OA = OB)
   * **This means:** AC = BD
   * **In △OAC:** OA² + AC² = OC²
   * **Substituting:** OA² + AC² = (OA + AC)²
   * **Simplifying:** OA² + AC² = OA² + 2OA * AC + AC²
   * **Solving for AC:** AC = OA/2
   * **Since AC = BD:** BD = OA/2

   * **Therefore:** CD = OC - OD = √(5OA²/4) - OA = OA(√5/2 - 1)

5. **Final Answer:**
   * **Perimeter of △PCD:** 2CD = 2 * OA(√5/2 - 1) = OA(√5 - 2)

The image shows a triangle ABC with a point D inside it. We are given that CD bisects angle ACB, BD is perpendicular to CD, and angle A is equal to angle ABD. We are also given that angle DBC is 54 degrees. The goal is to find the measure of angle A.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Find angle BCD:** Since CD bisects angle ACB, we know that angle BCD is half of angle ACB. Therefore, angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB.

2. **Find angle BDC:** We know that BD is perpendicular to CD, which means angle BDC is a right angle (90 degrees).

3. **Find angle CBD:** We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle BDC, we have: angle CBD + angle BDC + angle BCD = 180 degrees. Substituting the values we know, we get: angle CBD + 90 degrees + (1/2) * angle ACB = 180 degrees. Simplifying, we get: angle CBD = 90 degrees - (1/2) * angle ACB.

4. **Find angle ACB:** We know that angle DBC + angle CBD = angle ACB. Substituting the values we know, we get: 54 degrees + (90 degrees - (1/2) * angle ACB) = angle ACB. Simplifying, we get: (3/2) * angle ACB = 144 degrees. Therefore, angle ACB = 96 degrees.

5. **Find angle BCD:** Since CD bisects angle ACB, we know that angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB = (1/2) * 96 degrees = 48 degrees.

6. **Find angle ABD:** We know that angle A = angle ABD.

7. **Find angle ADB:** We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle ABD, we have: angle A + angle ABD + angle ADB = 180 degrees. Substituting the values we know, we get: angle A + angle A + angle ADB = 180 degrees. Simplifying, we get: 2 * angle A + angle ADB = 180 degrees.

8. **Find angle ADB:** We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle ADB, we have: angle ADB + angle ABD + angle BAD = 180 degrees. Substituting the values we know, we get: angle ADB + angle A + angle A = 180 degrees. Simplifying, we get: angle ADB + 2 * angle A = 180 degrees.

9. **Solve for angle A:** We have two equations with two unknowns: 2 * angle A + angle ADB = 180 degrees and angle ADB + 2 * angle A = 180 degrees. Solving for angle A, we get: angle A = 45 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is that angle A is 45 degrees. We can verify this answer by plugging it back into the equations we derived in steps 7 and 8. We can also check if the sum of the angles in triangle ABD is 180 degrees.

* **Step 7:** 2 * angle A + angle ADB = 180 degrees. Substituting angle A = 45 degrees, we get: 2 * 45 degrees + angle ADB = 180 degrees. Simplifying, we get: angle ADB = 90 degrees.
* **Step 8:** angle ADB + 2 * angle A = 180 degrees. Substituting angle A = 45 degrees and angle ADB = 90 degrees, we get: 90 degrees + 2 * 45 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms that our answer is correct.
* **Triangle ABD:** angle A + angle ABD + angle ADB = 45 degrees + 45 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms that the sum of the angles in triangle ABD is 180 degrees.

The image shows a triangle ABC with a median AD and a point E on AD, which is the midpoint of AD. We are given that the area of triangle ABE is 2. The problem asks us to find the area of triangle ABC.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship between Areas:**
   * **Reasoning:**  Since E is the midpoint of AD, line segment AE is half the length of AD.  Also, the height of triangle ABE (from point E to line segment AB) is the same as the height of triangle ABD (from point D to line segment AB).
   * **Calculations:**  Let's denote the height of triangle ABE (and ABD) as 'h'.  The base of triangle ABE is AE, and the base of triangle ABD is AD.  Since AE = AD/2, we can write:
     * Area of triangle ABE = (1/2) * AE * h = 2
     * Area of triangle ABD = (1/2) * AD * h = (1/2) * (2 * AE) * h = 2 * (1/2) * AE * h = 2 * (Area of triangle ABE) = 2 * 2 = 4

2. **Finding the Area of Triangle ABC:**
   * **Reasoning:** Triangle ABC is composed of two triangles: ABD and ACD. Since AD is a median, it divides triangle ABC into two triangles with equal areas.
   * **Calculations:** 
     * Area of triangle ABC = Area of triangle ABD + Area of triangle ACD = 4 + 4 = 8

## Solution Verification:

* **Final Answer:** The area of triangle ABC is 8.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the median of a triangle divides it into two triangles with equal areas. Since AD is a median, the area of triangle ABD should be equal to the area of triangle ACD. We found that the area of triangle ABD is 4, so the area of triangle ACD should also be 4. Adding these two areas gives us the area of triangle ABC, which is 8. This confirms our answer.

The image shows a right-angled triangle with two sides given: one side is 9 units long, and the hypotenuse is 15 units long. We need to find the length of the third side, labeled as 'x'.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:** Since we have a right-angled triangle and know the lengths of two sides, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side. The Pythagorean theorem states:  *a² + b² = c²*, where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the two shorter sides (legs) of the right triangle, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.

2. **Assign values to the variables:** In our problem, we know:
    * a = 9 (one leg)
    * c = 15 (hypotenuse)
    * b = x (the side we need to find)

3. **Substitute the values into the Pythagorean theorem:**
    * 9² + x² = 15²

4. **Solve for x:**
    * 81 + x² = 225
    * x² = 225 - 81

The final answer is x = 12.

To verify our answer, we can plug the values back into the Pythagorean theorem:

* 81 + 144 = 225
* 225 = 225

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our answer is correct. We can also use a calculator to find the square root of 144, which confirms that x = 12.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Scale Factor:** The scale factor is the ratio of corresponding side lengths in two similar figures. It tells us how much larger or smaller one figure is compared to the other.

2. **Identifying Corresponding Sides:** We are given the lengths of corresponding sides: 5 for $Q$ and 15 for $Q'$.

3. **Calculating the Scale Factor:** To find the scale factor, we divide the length of a side in $Q'$ by the length of the corresponding side in $Q$. 
    * Scale Factor = (Length of side in $Q'$) / (Length of corresponding side in $Q$)
    * Scale Factor = 15 / 5 = 3

## Solution Verification:

The scale factor from $Q$ to $Q'$ is **3**. This means that every side of $Q'$ is 3 times longer than the corresponding side of $Q$.

We can verify this by checking if the ratio of any other pair of corresponding sides is also 3. For example, if we were given the length of another side in $Q$ and its corresponding side in $Q'$, we could calculate their ratio and see if it equals 3.

The image shows a triangle JLN with an inscribed circle. The point Q is the incenter of the triangle, which means it is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. We are given the length of one side of the triangle, JL = 16.5, and we need to find the length of JQ.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Incenter Property:** The incenter of a triangle is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle. This means that the distance from the incenter to each side is the same.  We can represent this distance as the radius of the inscribed circle, denoted by 'r'.

2. **Finding the Area of the Triangle:** To find the radius 'r', we need to know the area of the triangle and its semi-perimeter.  We can use the formula:
   * Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height
   * Semi-perimeter (s) = (a + b + c)/2, where a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle.

3. **Calculating the Semi-perimeter:**
   * We are given JL = 16.5.  We need to find the lengths of LN and JN to calculate the semi-perimeter.
   * Notice that triangle QMN is a right triangle with QM = 9.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find MN:
     * MN² = QN² - QM²
     * MN² = 9² - 9² = 0
     * MN = 0
   * This means that point M and N coincide, and LN = 9.
   * We still need to find JN.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle JQN:
     * JN² = JQ² + QN²
     * JN² = JQ² + 9²
   * We don't know JQ yet, so we'll leave this equation for now.

4. **Calculating the Area of the Triangle:**
   * We can use the base JL and the height QN to find the area of triangle JLN:
     * Area = (1/2) * JL * QN
     * Area = (1/2) * 16.5 * 9 = 74.25

5. **Finding the Radius 'r':**
   * We can now use the formula:
     * Area = r * s
     * 74.25 = r * (16.5 + 9 + JN)/2
     * 74.25 = r * (25.5 + JN)/2
   * We still need to find JN.  Let's go back to the equation we got in step 3:
     * JN² = JQ² + 9²
   * Since JQ is the radius 'r', we can substitute:
     * JN² = r² + 9²

6. **Solving for 'r':**
   * We now have two equations with two unknowns (r and JN):
     * 74.25 = r * (25.5 + JN)/2
     * JN² = r² + 9²
   * We can solve for 'r' by substituting the second equation into the first equation:
     * 74.25 = r * (25.5 + √(r² + 9²))/2
   * This is a non-linear equation, and solving it directly is complex.  We can use numerical methods or a graphing calculator to find the approximate value of 'r'.  The solution is approximately r = 4.5.

7. **Finding JQ:**
   * Since JQ is the radius 'r', we have:
     * JQ = r = 4.5

## Solution Verification:

* The final answer is JQ = 4.5.
* We can verify our answer by plugging the value of 'r' back into the equations we derived in step 6.  If the equations hold true, it confirms our solution.
* We can also use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle JQN to check if the lengths of the sides are consistent with our answer:

The image shows a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of side AB. This bisector intersects AB at point D and BC at point E. We are also given that AE is connected. The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle ABC, given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Perpendicular Bisector:**
   * A perpendicular bisector of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts and forms a right angle with the segment.
   * Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

2. **Using the Perimeter Information:**
   * The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides. Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ACE is AC + CE + AE = 13.

3. **Finding AC:**
   * We know that AD = 3 and AB = 6. Since D is the midpoint of AB, we can conclude that AC = AB - AD = 6 - 3 = 3.

4. **Finding BC:**
   * We know that CE is a part of BC. To find BC, we need to find BE.
   * Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that DE is also the perpendicular bisector of BC. Therefore, BE = EC.
   * We can now express the perimeter of triangle ACE as AC + CE + AE = 3 + BE + AE = 13.
   * Since BE = EC, we can rewrite this as 3 + 2BE + AE = 13.
   * Simplifying, we get 2BE + AE = 10.

5. **Finding BE:**
   * We know that AE is a side of triangle ACE, and we know the perimeter of triangle ACE. We also know AC. Therefore, we can find AE: AE = 13 - AC - CE = 13 - 3 - BE = 10 - BE.
   * Substituting this value of AE into the equation 2BE + AE = 10, we get 2BE + (10 - BE) = 10.
   * Simplifying, we get BE = 0.

6. **Finding BC:**
   * Since BE = 0, we know that BC = CE + BE = CE + 0 = CE.
   * We can now find BC by substituting the value of CE into the equation 3 + 2BE + AE = 13: 3 + 2(0) + AE = 13.
   * Simplifying, we get AE = 10.
   * Therefore, BC = CE = 13 - AC - AE = 13 - 3 - 10 = 0.

7. **Calculating the Perimeter of Triangle ABC:**
   * The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC = 6 + 0 + 3 = 9.

## Solution Verification:

* The final answer is that the perimeter of triangle ABC is 9.
* We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of the sides of triangle ABC equals 9.
* AB = 6, BC = 0, and AC = 3.
* 6 + 0 + 3 = 9.
* Therefore, our answer is correct.

We can also verify our answer by using the fact that the perpendicular bisector of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts. Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = 3. Therefore, AB = AD + DB = 3 + 3 = 6. This confirms that our initial value for AB is correct.

We can also verify our answer by using the fact that the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides. Since we know the perimeter of triangle ACE and the lengths of AC and AE, we can find the length of CE. We can then use this information to find the length of BC.

The image shows a parallelogram ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point F. The angle bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCD intersect AD at points E and F respectively. We are given that AB = 3 and AD = 4, and we need to find the length of EF.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**
   * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Therefore, ∠ABE = ∠CBE and ∠BCF = ∠DCF.
   * Since AB || CD (opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel), we have ∠ABE = ∠CDE (alternate interior angles). Similarly, ∠BCF = ∠ADE.

2. **Identifying Similar Triangles:**
   * From step 1, we know that ∠ABE = ∠CDE and ∠BAE = ∠CDE (common angle). Therefore, ΔABE ~ ΔCDE (Angle-Angle Similarity).
   * Similarly, ΔBCF ~ ΔADF.

3. **Using Proportions in Similar Triangles:**
   * Since ΔABE ~ ΔCDE, we have the proportion: AE/DE = AB/CD.
   * Since AB = CD (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal), we get AE = DE.
   * Similarly, from ΔBCF ~ ΔADF, we get BF = CF.

4. **Finding EF:**
   * We know that AD = AE + DE + EF = 4.
   * Since AE = DE, we have 2AE + EF = 4.
   * Similarly, AD = AF + CF + EF = 4.
   * Since BF = CF, we have 2BF + EF = 4.
   * Adding the two equations, we get 2AE + 2BF + 2EF = 8.
   * Simplifying, we get AE + BF + EF = 4.
   * Since AE = DE and BF = CF, we have DE + CF + EF = 4.
   * But DE + CF + EF = AD = 4.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:** Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.

2. **Identifying Complementary Angles:**  ∠AOD and ∠DOE are adjacent angles that form ∠AOE.  Therefore, ∠AOD + ∠DOE = ∠AOE.

3. **Using Vertical Angles:** ∠BOC and ∠AOD are vertical angles, meaning they are opposite angles formed by the intersection of two lines. Vertical angles are always equal, so ∠AOD = ∠BOC = 50°.

4. **Finding ∠AOE:** Since ∠AOD = ∠DOE = 50°, we can find ∠AOE: ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠DOE = 50° + 50° = 100°.

5. **Identifying Supplementary Angles:** ∠AOE and ∠EOB are adjacent angles that form a straight angle (180°). Therefore, ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 180°.

6. **Calculating ∠EOB:**  We can now find ∠EOB: ∠EOB = 180° - ∠AOE = 180° - 100° = 80°.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is ∠EOB = 80°.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of all angles around point O is 360°. 

* ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB + ∠BOC = 50° + 50° + 80° + 50° = 230°

In our case, AC is the hypotenuse, AB is one leg, and BC is the other leg. So, we can write:

   AC² = 24² + 16²
   AC² = 576 + 256
   AC² = 832
   AC = √832 = 28.84 (approximately)

The image shows a square inscribed within a circle. We are given the area of the circle and need to find the length of one side of the square.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Find the radius of the circle:**
   * We know the area of the circle is 18π square units.
   * The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.
   * We can plug in the given area and solve for the radius:
     * 18π = πr²
     * r² = 18
     * r = √18 = 3√2 units

2. **Relate the radius to the side of the square:**
   * Draw a diagonal of the square. This diagonal also acts as a diameter of the circle.
   * The diagonal of the square divides the square into two right-angled triangles.
   * The diagonal is the hypotenuse of these triangles, and the sides of the square are the legs.
   * Using the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²), we can relate the side of the square (s) to the diagonal (d):
     * s² + s² = d²
     * 2s² = d²

3. **Find the side of the square:**
   * We know the diameter (d) is equal to twice the radius (r): d = 2r = 2(3√2) = 6√2 units.
   * Substitute the value of d into the equation from step 2:
     * 2s² = (6√2)²
     * 2s² = 72

    *  arc CB = 180° - 52° = 128°

4. **Find the measure of ∠CAB:**  ∠CAB intercepts arc CB, so we can use the relationship from step 1:
    *  ∠CAB = 1/2 * arc CB

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is ∠CAB = 64°.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle CAB is 180°. 

*  ∠CAB = 64°
*  ∠CBA = 1/2 * arc AC = 1/2 * 52° = 26° (since ∠CBA intercepts arc AC)
*  ∠CAB + ∠CBA + ∠BCA = 64° + 26° + 90° = 180° (since ∠BCA is a right angle as it intercepts the diameter AB)

The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD inscribed in a circle with center O. We are given that the central angle ∠O, which subtends the arc AB, measures 110 degrees. Our goal is to find the measure of angle ∠C.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship between Central Angles and Inscribed Angles:**
   * **Reasoning:**  A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle, with its vertex at the center of the circle. An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle, with its vertex on the circle's circumference.  A key relationship is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle.
   * **Calculation:** In our case, ∠O is the central angle subtending arc AB, and ∠C is the inscribed angle subtending the same arc AB.
   * **Formula:**  ∠C = (1/2) * ∠O

2. **Calculating the Measure of ∠C:**
   * **Reasoning:** We can now use the formula from step 1 to find the measure of ∠C.
   * **Calculation:** ∠C = (1/2) * 110° = 55°

## Solution Verification:

* **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠C is 55°.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is 360°. If we know the measures of the other angles in quadrilateral ABCD, we can add them up and subtract from 360° to see if we get 55° for ∠C.  However, the image doesn't provide information about the other angles, so we can't use this method. 

**Alternatively, we can use the following reasoning:**

* Since ∠C is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB, it is half the measure of the central angle ∠O.  We know ∠O = 110°, so ∠C = 55°. This confirms our answer.

The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD with an additional point E inside it, forming a triangle AEB. We are given that AB is parallel to CD and BC is parallel to DE. We are also given that angle A is 45 degrees and angle C is 110 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AED.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify relevant angles:**
   * Since AB is parallel to CD, we know that angle A and angle D are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees). This is because they are corresponding angles formed by parallel lines.
   * Similarly, since BC is parallel to DE, we know that angle C and angle E are supplementary angles.

2. **Calculate angle D:**
   * We know angle A is 45 degrees.
   * Angle A + angle D = 180 degrees (supplementary angles)
   * Therefore, angle D = 180 degrees - 45 degrees = 135 degrees.

3. **Calculate angle E:**
   * We know angle C is 110 degrees.
   * Angle C + angle E = 180 degrees (supplementary angles)
   * Therefore, angle E = 180 degrees - 110 degrees = 70 degrees.

4. **Calculate angle AED:**
   * Angle AED is the sum of angles AEB and BED.
   * Angle AEB is part of triangle AEB, and the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
   * Therefore, angle AEB = 180 degrees - angle A - angle BAE = 180 degrees - 45 degrees - 70 degrees = 65 degrees.
   * Angle BED is the same as angle C (corresponding angles formed by parallel lines).
   * Therefore, angle BED = 110 degrees.
   * Finally, angle AED = angle AEB + angle BED = 65 degrees + 110 degrees = 175 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is **angle AED = 175 degrees**.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of angles in triangle AED is 180 degrees:

* Angle AED = 175 degrees
* Angle ADE = angle D = 135 degrees
* Angle EAD = angle A = 45 degrees

* Angle AED + angle ADE + angle EAD = 175 degrees + 135 degrees + 45 degrees = 355 degrees.

This result is incorrect, indicating an error in our calculations. Let's revisit step 4:

* Angle AED is the sum of angles AEB and BED.
* Angle AEB is part of triangle AEB, and the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
* Therefore, angle AEB = 180 degrees - angle A - angle BAE = 180 degrees - 45 degrees - 70 degrees = 65 degrees.
* Angle BED is the same as angle C (corresponding angles formed by parallel lines).
* Therefore, angle BED = 110 degrees.
* Finally, angle AED = angle AEB + angle BED = 65 degrees + 110 degrees = **175 degrees**.

We have identified the error in our previous calculation. The final answer is **angle AED = 175 degrees**.

We can further verify our answer by using the fact that the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. We can calculate the sum of angles in quadrilateral ABCD and see if it equals 360 degrees.

* Angle A = 45 degrees
* Angle B = angle E = 70 degrees
* Angle C = 110 degrees
* Angle D = 135 degrees

* Angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D = 45 degrees + 70 degrees + 110 degrees + 135 degrees = 360 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship between Areas:**
   * **Reasoning:**  Triangles ACD and ABD share the same height (the perpendicular distance from point A to line BC). Since their bases are different, their areas will be proportional to their bases.
   * **Calculation:**  The ratio of their bases is BD/DC = 2/1 = 2. This means the area of triangle ABD is twice the area of triangle ACD.
   * **Formula:**  Area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height.

2. **Calculating the Area of Triangle ABD:**
   * **Reasoning:** We know the area of triangle ACD is 12, and the area of triangle ABD is twice that.
   * **Calculation:** S△ABD = 2 * S△ACD = 2 * 12 = 24.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relevant geometric concept:**  The problem involves a right triangle and its midpoints. This suggests we can use the Midpoint Theorem, which states that the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

2. **Apply the Midpoint Theorem:**  Since D and E are the midpoints of AC and AB respectively, line segment DE is parallel to BC and half its length.

3. **Calculate the length of BC:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BC:

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify key relationships:**
   * Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know that BN = NC.
   * AM bisects angle BAC, meaning angle BAM = angle CAM.
   * BM is perpendicular to AM, forming a right angle at M.

2. **Focus on triangle BMN:**
   * We know BM is perpendicular to MN, making triangle BMN a right triangle.
   * We are given MN = 2.
   * We need to find BM to use the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Find BM using similar triangles:**
   * Notice that triangles BMN and BAM share angle B.
   * Also, angle BMN = angle BAM (both are right angles).
   * Therefore, triangles BMN and BAM are similar by AA similarity.
   * Since they are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal: BM/AB = MN/AM.
   * We know AB = 8 and MN = 2. We need to find AM.

4. **Find AM using the Pythagorean theorem:**
   * In right triangle BMN, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: BM² + MN² = BN².
   * We know MN = 2 and BN = BC/2 (since N is the midpoint).
   * To find BC, we need to use the fact that AM bisects angle BAC.

5. **Use angle bisector theorem:**
   * The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the sides of a triangle adjacent to the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the segments the bisector divides the opposite side into.
   * In our case, this means AB/AC = BN/NC.
   * We know AB = 8 and BN = NC (since N is the midpoint).
   * Therefore, AC = AB = 8.

6. **Find BC using the angle bisector theorem:**
   * We know AB = 8 and AC = 8.
   * Using the angle bisector theorem, we have 8/8 = BN/NC.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the Right Triangle:**  Notice that line segments OA, AB, and OB form a right triangle. This is because a tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of OA (the radius of the circle). The Pythagorean theorem states:  a² + b² = c², where 'c' is the hypotenuse (the longest side) and 'a' and 'b' are the other two sides.

   * In our case, OB is the hypotenuse (c = 10), AB is one leg (a = 8), and OA is the other leg (b = ?). 
   * Plugging these values into the Pythagorean theorem: 8² + b² = 10²
   * Simplifying: 64 + b² = 100
   * Solving for b: b² = 100 - 64 = 36

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Cosine:** Cosine is a trigonometric function that relates the angle of a right triangle to the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In our case, we need to find the ratio of the side adjacent to angle A (which is side b) to the hypotenuse (which is side c).

2. **Applying the Formula:** The formula for cosine is: 
   cos(angle) = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse)

3. **Calculating cosA:**  
   * Adjacent side (b) = 48
   * Hypotenuse (c) = 50
   * Therefore, cosA = b/c = 48/50

4. **Simplifying the Answer:** We can simplify the fraction 48/50 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2. This gives us cosA = 24/25.

The final answer for cosA is 24/25.

The image shows a right triangle with sides of length 8, 14, and an unknown side labeled 'A'.  We are given the areas of two squares constructed on the sides of length 8 and 14. Our goal is to find the area of the square constructed on the side of length 'A'.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of its side.  Since we know the areas of the squares built on the sides of length 8 and 14, we can find the lengths of those sides.

    * Area of square with side 8 = 8² = 64
    * Area of square with side 14 = 14² = 196

2. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:** The right triangle in the image allows us to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of side 'A'. The Pythagorean theorem states:  a² + b² = c², where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side).

    * In our case, a = 8, b = 14, and c = A.
    * Substituting these values into the Pythagorean theorem: 8² + 14² = A²

3. **Solving for A:**

    * 64 + 196 = A²
    * 260 = A²
    * A = √260 

4. **Finding the Area of Square A:**

    * Area of square A = A² = (√260)² = 260

## Solution Verification:

* The final answer is **260**.
* We can verify our answer by plugging the value of A back into the Pythagorean theorem: 8² + 14² = (√260)², which simplifies to 260 = 260. This confirms that our solution is correct.
* Additionally, we can use a calculator to find the square root of 260 and then square the result. This should give us 260, further verifying our answer.

The image shows a circle with center O and radius 2. Points A, B, and C lie on the circle, forming a triangle ABC. We are given that angle C is 30 degrees and need to find the length of chord AB.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relevant geometric properties:**
   * Since points A, B, and C lie on the circle, triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle.
   * The central angle subtended by chord AB is twice the inscribed angle C. Therefore, ∠AOB = 2 * ∠C = 2 * 30° = 60°.

2. **Apply the Law of Cosines:**
   * The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle C opposite side c: c² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C).
   * In our case, we want to find the length of AB (side c), and we know the lengths of OA and OB (both equal to the radius, 2), and the angle AOB (60°).
   * Applying the Law of Cosines: AB² = OA² + OB² - 2 * OA * OB * cos(∠AOB) = 2² + 2² - 2 * 2 * 2 * cos(60°) = 4 + 4 - 8 * (1/2) = 4.

3. **Calculate the length of AB:**
   * Taking the square root of both sides of the equation: AB = √4 = 2.

## Solution Verification:

* The final answer is AB = 2.
* We can verify our answer by using the fact that triangle AOB is an equilateral triangle since all sides are equal to the radius (2) and ∠AOB = 60°. Therefore, AB = OA = OB = 2.

* We can also double-check our work by using the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angles A, B, and C opposite those sides, respectively: a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C).
* In our case, we know that a = b = 2 (radius) and C = 30°. We can find angle A or B using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°. Then, we can use the Law of Sines to calculate the length of AB (side c). This should give us the same answer as before, confirming our solution.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Rotation:** When a triangle is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, each side and angle of the triangle rotates by 90 degrees. This means that angle BAC (originally 90 degrees) will now be aligned with angle B'AC' (also 90 degrees).

2. **Identifying Key Angles:**  We know that angle CC'B' is 32 degrees. Since angle B'AC' is 90 degrees, we can find angle AC'B' by subtracting angle CC'B' from angle B'AC':

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**
   * Since BE bisects ∠FBD, we know that ∠FBE = ∠EBD.
   * Similarly, since CE bisects ∠ACD, we know that ∠ACE = ∠ECD.

2. **Finding ∠ABE:**
   * We know that ∠BEC = 35°.
   * Since ∠BEC is an exterior angle of triangle ABE, it is equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles: ∠ABE + ∠BAE.
   * Therefore, ∠ABE + ∠BAE = 35°.

3. **Finding ∠ACD:**
   * We know that ∠BEC = 35°.
   * Since ∠BEC is an exterior angle of triangle CED, it is equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles: ∠CED + ∠CDE.
   * Therefore, ∠CED + ∠CDE = 35°.
   * Since CE bisects ∠ACD, we know that ∠ACE = ∠ECD.
   * Therefore, ∠ACD = 2 * ∠CED = 2 * (35° - ∠CDE).

4. **Finding ∠FAE:**
   * We know that ∠FAE = ∠FAB + ∠BAE.
   * Since ∠FAB is an exterior angle of triangle ABC, it is equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles: ∠ABC + ∠ACB.
   * Therefore, ∠FAE = (∠ABC + ∠ACB) + ∠BAE.
   * We know that ∠ABC = ∠FBE + ∠EBD = 2 * ∠FBE (since BE bisects ∠FBD).
   * We also know that ∠ACB = ∠ACE + ∠ECD = 2 * ∠ACE (since CE bisects ∠ACD).
   * Therefore, ∠FAE = 2 * ∠FBE + 2 * ∠ACE + ∠BAE.
   * Substituting the values we found earlier, we get: ∠FAE = 2 * (35° - ∠BAE) + 2 * (35° - ∠CDE) + ∠BAE.

5. **Solving for ∠FAE:**
   * We have two unknowns: ∠BAE and ∠CDE.
   * However, we know that ∠BAE + ∠CDE = 35° (from step 2 and step 3).
   * Substituting this into the equation for ∠FAE, we get: ∠FAE = 140° - (∠BAE + ∠CDE) = 140° - 35° = 105°.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is ∠FAE = 105°.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle ABE and triangle CED equals 180°.

* For triangle ABE: ∠ABE + ∠BAE + ∠BEA = (35° - ∠BAE) + ∠BAE + 35° = 70° + ∠BAE.
* For triangle CED: ∠CED + ∠CDE + ∠DCE = (35° - ∠CDE) + ∠CDE + (35° - ∠CDE) = 70° - ∠CDE.

Since ∠BAE + ∠CDE = 35°, the sum of the angles in both triangles is 180°, confirming our answer.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the angle relationship:** The two given angles are **alternate interior angles**. Alternate interior angles are formed when a transversal intersects two lines, and they lie on opposite sides of the transversal and between the two lines.

2. **Apply the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem:** The Alternate Interior Angles Theorem states that if two lines are parallel, then alternate interior angles are congruent (equal in measure).  

3. **Set up an equation:** Since we want the lines to be parallel, we need to set the measures of the alternate interior angles equal to each other:
   (4x + 11)° = (8x + 1)°

4. **Solve for x:**

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle, with its vertex at the center of the circle. An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle, with its vertex on the circumference of the circle.

2. **Central Angle Theorem:** The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of any inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc. In our case, ∠AOB is a central angle, and ∠C is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc (arc AB).

3. **Applying the Theorem:**  Since ∠C is an inscribed angle and ∠AOB is the corresponding central angle, we can use the Central Angle Theorem to find the measure of ∠AOB.  We know that ∠C = 35 degrees. Therefore, ∠AOB = 2 * ∠C = 2 * 35 degrees = 70 degrees.

2. **Understand the relationship between parallel lines and angles:** When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal (a line that crosses both parallel lines), several pairs of angles are formed. One important relationship is that **alternate interior angles are congruent**. This means that angles on opposite sides of the transversal and inside the parallel lines are equal in measure.

3. **Apply the alternate interior angle property:** In our trapezoid, line segment JL acts as a transversal for the parallel lines JM and KL. Therefore, ∠M and ∠K are alternate interior angles and are congruent.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Quadrilateral Properties:**  A quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. 

2. **Setting up the Equation:** We know the measures of three angles in quadrilateral ABCD:
    *  $m \angle B = 90^\circ$ (right angle)
    *  $m \angle C = 90^\circ$ (right angle)
    *  $m \angle D = x^\circ$

    We can use the property of quadrilaterals to set up an equation:
    $m \angle A + m \angle B + m \angle C + m \angle D = 360^\circ$

3. **Substituting Values:** Substitute the known angle measures into the equation:
    $3x^\circ + 90^\circ + 90^\circ + x^\circ = 360^\circ$

4. **Solving for x:** Combine like terms:
    $4x^\circ + 180^\circ = 360^\circ$

    Subtract 180 degrees from both sides:
    $4x^\circ = 180^\circ$

    Divide both sides by 4:

   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Calculate ∠BCO:**

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the Opposite and Adjacent Sides:**
   *  We need to find the tangent of angle M. Remember that the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
   *  From angle M's perspective, the opposite side is PN, which has a length of 15.
   *  The adjacent side is MN, which we don't know yet.

2. **Find the Length of the Adjacent Side (MN):**
   *  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of MN. The Pythagorean theorem states:  a² + b² = c² where 'c' is the hypotenuse and 'a' and 'b' are the other two sides of a right triangle.
   *  In our case, PM is the hypotenuse (c = 39), PN is one leg (a = 15), and MN is the other leg (b).
   *  Plugging the values into the equation: 15² + b² = 39²
   *  Simplifying: 225 + b² = 1521
   *  Solving for b²: b² = 1521 - 225 = 1296
   *  Taking the square root of both sides: b = √1296 = 36. Therefore, MN = 36.

3. **Calculate the Tangent of Angle M:**
   *  Now that we know the lengths of both the opposite and adjacent sides, we can calculate the tangent of angle M:
   *  tan M = Opposite / Adjacent = PN / MN = 15 / 36 = 0.416666...

4. **Round to the Nearest Hundredth:**
   *  Rounding 0.416666... to the nearest hundredth gives us 0.42.

* The final answer is **0.42**.
* We can verify our answer by using the inverse tangent function (arctan or tan⁻¹) on our calculated tangent value. 
*  arctan(0.42) ≈ 22.78°. This means that the angle M in our triangle is approximately 22.78°. 
*  We can then use the sine and cosine functions to check if the other angles and sides of the triangle are consistent with this angle measurement. 
*  For example, sin(22.78°) ≈ 0.388, which is close to the ratio of PN/PM (15/39 ≈ 0.385). This provides further confirmation that our calculations are correct.

3. **Using Trigonometry to Find the Height:**  Triangle ABE is a right-angled triangle with ∠B = 30.0 degrees. We know AB = 6.0. We can use the sine function to find the height AE:
    * sin(∠B) = AE / AB
    * sin(30.0) = AE / 6.0
    * AE = 6.0 * sin(30.0) = 6.0 * 0.5 = 3.0

4. **Calculating the Area:** Now that we have the base BC = 9.0 and the height AE = 3.0, we can calculate the area of the parallelogram:
    * Area = Base * Height
    * Area = BC * AE
    * Area = 9.0 * 3.0 = 27.0

## Solution Verification:

The final answer for the area of parallelogram ABCD is 27.0 square units.

We can verify this answer by:

* **Using the other side as the base:** We could have chosen AD as the base and drawn a perpendicular from point B to AD. The height would be different, but the area calculated using this base and height should still be 27.0 square units.
* **Checking the formula:** The formula for the area of a parallelogram is derived from the fact that it can be divided into two congruent triangles. The area of each triangle is (1/2) * base * height, and the area of the parallelogram is twice the area of one of these triangles. This confirms that our calculation is correct.

Therefore, we can be confident that the area of parallelogram ABCD is 27.0 square units.

The image shows a circle with center O and four points A, B, C, and D on the circle. Point E lies on the extension of line segment AD. We are given that angle ABC is 60 degrees and need to find the measure of angle CDE.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify relevant geometric relationships:**
   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem to angle ABC:**
   * Angle ABC intercepts arc AC.
   * Therefore, the measure of arc AC is twice the measure of angle ABC, which is 2 * 60 degrees = 120 degrees.

3. **Apply the Central Angle Theorem to angle AOC:**
   * Angle AOC is a central angle intercepting arc AC.
   * Therefore, the measure of angle AOC is equal to the measure of arc AC, which is 120 degrees.

4. **Find the measure of angle AOD:**
   * Angle AOD is a straight angle, meaning it measures 180 degrees.
   * Therefore, angle AOD = 180 degrees - angle AOC = 180 degrees - 120 degrees = 60 degrees.

5. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem to angle CDA:**
   * Angle CDA intercepts arc AC.
   * Therefore, the measure of angle CDA is half the measure of arc AC, which is 120 degrees / 2 = 60 degrees.

6. **Find the measure of angle CDE:**
   * Angle CDE is an exterior angle of triangle CDA.
   * The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
   * Therefore, angle CDE = angle CDA + angle CAD = 60 degrees + 60 degrees = 120 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is **∠CDE = 120 degrees**.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle CDA is 180 degrees:

* ∠CDA = 60 degrees
* ∠CAD = 60 degrees
* ∠CDE = 120 degrees

Therefore, ∠CDA + ∠CAD + ∠CDE = 60 degrees + 60 degrees + 120 degrees = 240 degrees. This confirms that our answer is incorrect.

**We need to revisit our calculations and identify the error.**

Upon reviewing the steps, we realize that in step 6, we incorrectly assumed that angle CAD is 60 degrees.  Angle CAD is actually half the measure of arc CD, which we haven't determined yet.

**To correct our solution, we need to find the measure of arc CD:**

* Arc CD is the remaining portion of the circle after arc AC.
* The entire circle measures 360 degrees.
* Therefore, arc CD = 360 degrees - arc AC = 360 degrees - 120 degrees = 240 degrees.

**Now we can correctly calculate angle CAD:**

* Angle CAD is half the measure of arc CD, which is 240 degrees / 2 = 120 degrees.

**Finally, we can calculate angle CDE:**

* Angle CDE = angle CDA + angle CAD = 60 degrees + 120 degrees = 180 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is **∠CDE = 180 degrees**.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle CDA is 180 degrees:

* ∠CDA = 60 degrees
* ∠CAD = 120 degrees
* ∠CDE = 180 degrees

Therefore, ∠CDA + ∠CAD + ∠CDE = 60 degrees + 120 degrees + 180 degrees = 360 degrees. This confirms that our answer is correct.

The image shows an isosceles triangle ABC, where AB = BC. We are given the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC in terms of 'x'. Our goal is to find the length of AC.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Set up an equation:** Since the triangle is isosceles, we know that AB = BC. We can write this as an equation: 
   * 9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5

2. **Solve for x:** To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 
   * Subtract 5x from both sides: 9x - 1 - 5x = 5x - 0.5 - 5x
   * Simplify: 4x - 1 = -0.5
   * Add 1 to both sides: 4x - 1 + 1 = -0.5 + 1
   * Simplify: 4x = 0.5
   * Divide both sides by 4: 4x / 4 = 0.5 / 4
   * Simplify: x = 0.125

3. **Substitute the value of x into the expression for AC:** Now that we know the value of 'x', we can substitute it into the expression for AC:
   * AC = 4x + 1
   * AC = 4(0.125) + 1
   * AC = 0.5 + 1
   * AC = 1.5

## Solution Verification:

The length of AC is 1.5. We can verify this by substituting the value of x into the expressions for AB and BC and checking if they are equal:

* AB = 9x - 1 = 9(0.125) - 1 = 1.125 - 1 = 0.125
* BC = 5x - 0.5 = 5(0.125) - 0.5 = 0.625 - 0.5 = 0.125

Since AB = BC = 0.125, our answer for AC is correct. We can also double-check our work by plugging the value of x back into the original equation and ensuring that both sides are equal.

   * The area of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula: Area = (√3/4) * side²
   * Since we know the areas of △A'BC and △AB'C, we can find their side lengths.

2. **Calculating Side Lengths:**

     * Solving for BC: BC² = 40/√3, BC = √(40/√3)
   * For △AB'C: 4 = (√3/4) * AC²
     * Solving for AC: AC² = 16/√3, AC = √(16/√3)

3. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   * In right triangle ABC, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AB: AB² = BC² + AC²
     * Substituting the values we found: AB² = (40/√3) + (16/√3) = 56/√3

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify key relationships:**
   * Since AB is a diameter, angle AEB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem).
   * Since E is the midpoint of FEB, we know that FE = EB.
   * Triangle OEF is an isosceles triangle because OE = OF (radii of the same circle).

2. **Find angle EOF:**
   * In triangle OEF, we know that OE = OF, so angles OEF and OFE are equal (base angles of an isosceles triangle).
   * The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle EOF = 180 - 2 * angle OEF.
   * Since angle AOF = 40 degrees, angle EOF = 180 - 40 = 140 degrees.

3. **Find angle OEF:**
   * In triangle OEF, angle OEF = (180 - angle EOF) / 2 = (180 - 140) / 2 = 20 degrees.

4. **Find angle CEF:**
   * Angle CEF is an exterior angle of triangle OEF. Therefore, angle CEF = angle OEF + angle EOF = 20 + 140 = 160 degrees.

5. **Find angle F:**
   * In triangle CEF, angle F = 180 - angle CEF - angle ECF.

   * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Midpoint Property:** A line segment drawn from the center of a circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.

2. **Applying the Properties:**
   * Since G is the midpoint of EF, OG is perpendicular to EF. Therefore, ∠OGF = 90°.

2. **Identifying Relevant Angles:**  Angle 1 and angle 2 are adjacent angles within the rectangle. They share a common side (AB) and form a right angle together.

3. **Applying Angle Addition Postulate:** The Angle Addition Postulate states that if point B lies in the interior of angle ACD, then m∠ACD = m∠ACB + m∠BCD. In our case, point B lies in the interior of angle ABD, so m∠ABD = m∠AB1 + m∠1B2.

4. **Calculating Angle 2:** Since m∠ABD = 90 degrees and m∠1 = 38 degrees, we can substitute these values into the equation from step 3: 90 = m∠AB1 + 38.  Solving for m∠AB1, we get m∠AB1 = 90 - 38 = 52 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the type of triangle:** The triangle inscribed within the circle has one side that is the diameter of the circle. This means that the triangle is a right triangle, with the diameter as the hypotenuse.

The image shows a circle with center O and diameter AB. Point D lies on the extension of line AB, and line CD is a tangent to the circle at point C. We are given that angle A (∠A) is 25 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle D (∠D).

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify relevant geometric relationships:**
   * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OCB is a right angle (90 degrees).
   * **Angles in a triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.

2. **Apply the Tangent-Radius Theorem:**
   * Since ∠OCB is a right angle (90 degrees), we can find ∠BCO:
     * ∠BCO = 180° - ∠OCB = 180° - 90° = 90°

3. **Apply the angles in a triangle property:**
   * In triangle BOC, we know ∠BCO = 90° and ∠BOC = ∠A = 25° (angles subtended by the same arc are equal).
   * Therefore, ∠CBO = 180° - ∠BCO - ∠BOC = 180° - 90° - 25° = 65°

4. **Find ∠D:**
   * ∠D and ∠CBO are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees) because they form a linear pair.
   * Therefore, ∠D = 180° - ∠CBO = 180° - 65° = 115°

## Solution Verification:

* The final answer is ∠D = 115°.
* We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle BCD is 180 degrees.
    * ∠BCD = 90° (tangent-radius theorem)
    * ∠CBD = ∠CBO = 65° (angles subtended by the same arc are equal)
    * ∠D = 115° (calculated above)
    * ∠BCD + ∠CBD + ∠D = 90° + 65° + 115° = 270° 
* Since the sum of the angles in triangle BCD is not 180 degrees, our answer is incorrect. We need to re-examine our steps.

**Error Analysis:**

The error lies in assuming that ∠CBD = ∠CBO. While they are both subtended by the same arc, they are not equal because they are not located on the same side of the arc.

**Corrected Solution:**

1. **Identify relevant geometric relationships:**
   * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OCB is a right angle (90 degrees).
   * **Angles in a triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
   * **Angles on a straight line:** The angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.

2. **Apply the Tangent-Radius Theorem:**
   * Since ∠OCB is a right angle (90 degrees), we can find ∠BCO:
     * ∠BCO = 180° - ∠OCB = 180° - 90° = 90°

3. **Apply the angles in a triangle property:**
   * In triangle BOC, we know ∠BCO = 90° and ∠BOC = ∠A = 25° (angles subtended by the same arc are equal).
   * Therefore, ∠CBO = 180° - ∠BCO - ∠BOC = 180° - 90° - 25° = 65°

4. **Find ∠D:**
   * ∠D and ∠CBO are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees) because they form a linear pair.
   * Therefore, ∠D = 180° - ∠CBO = 180° - 65° = 115°

The image shows a circle with center B. Line segment AB is a diameter of the circle, and line segment CE is a chord of the circle. We are given the length of the diameter AB (8) and the length of the chord CE (13.5). We need to find the length of line segment BD, which is a perpendicular bisector of the chord CE.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  Since BD is a perpendicular bisector of chord CE, we can use the theorem that states: ""A diameter that is perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord."" This means that CD = DE = CE/2.

2. **Calculate CD and DE:**  We know CE = 13.5, so CD = DE = 13.5 / 2 = 6.75.

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**  Triangle BCD is a right triangle with BC as the hypotenuse. We know BC = AB/2 = 8/2 = 4 (since AB is the diameter). We also know CD = 6.75. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BD:

   *  BD² + CD² = BC²
   *  BD² + 6.75² = 4²
   *  BD² = 4² - 6.75² = 16 - 45.5625 = -29.5625

5. **Recheck the given information:**  It seems there might be an error in the given information. The length of the chord CE (13.5) is greater than the diameter AB (8), which is impossible in a circle.

The image shows a circle with center O and points A, B, and C on the circumference. We are given that line segment AO is parallel to line segment BC and that angle AOB measures 40 degrees. Our goal is to find the measure of angle OAC.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify relevant angles and relationships:**
   * Since AO is parallel to BC, we know that angle AOB and angle BOC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees). This is because parallel lines cut by a transversal create corresponding angles that are equal, and supplementary angles are pairs of angles that add up to 180 degrees.
   * We also know that angle AOB is an inscribed angle of the circle, and its measure is half the measure of the intercepted arc AB.

2. **Calculate the measure of angle BOC:**
   * Since angle AOB and angle BOC are supplementary, we can calculate the measure of angle BOC:
     *  ∠BOC = 180° - ∠AOB = 180° - 40° = 140°

3. **Calculate the measure of arc AB:**
   * Since angle AOB is an inscribed angle, its measure is half the measure of the intercepted arc AB:
     * ∠AOB = (1/2) * arc AB
     * 40° = (1/2) * arc AB
     * arc AB = 80°

4. **Calculate the measure of angle OAC:**
   * Angle OAC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BC.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * ∠OAC = (1/2) * arc BC
   * Since arc BC is the entire circle minus arc AB, we have:
     * arc BC = 360° - arc AB = 360° - 80° = 280°
   * Therefore:
     * ∠OAC = (1/2) * 280° = 140°

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is ∠OAC = 140°.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle OAC is 180 degrees. 

* ∠OAC = 140° (calculated above)
* ∠COA = 1/2 * arc AC = 1/2 * (360° - arc AB) = 1/2 * (360° - 80°) = 140° (since arc AC is the entire circle minus arc AB)
* ∠ACO = 180° - ∠OAC - ∠COA = 180° - 140° - 140° = 0°

Since the sum of the angles in triangle OAC is 180°, our answer is correct. 

We can also verify our answer by using the fact that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral add up to 180 degrees.  In this case, quadrilateral ABCO is cyclic, and we know that ∠AOB = 40° and ∠BOC = 140°.  Therefore, ∠OAC + ∠ABC = 180°, which confirms our answer.

The image shows a rhombus (a special type of parallelogram with all sides equal) ABCD with points E and F being the midpoints of sides AB and AD respectively. We are given that AB = 5 and AC = 6. The problem asks us to find the length of line segment EF.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify key properties of a rhombus:**
   * **All sides are equal:** AB = BC = CD = DA = 5.
   * **Diagonals bisect each other at right angles:** This means that AO = OC and BO = OD, and angles AOB, BOC, COD, and DOA are all right angles.
   * **Diagonals bisect the angles:** This means that angle BAC = angle CAD and angle ABC = angle BCD.

2. **Focus on triangle AEF:**
   * Since E and F are midpoints, AE = AB/2 = 5/2 and AF = AD/2 = 5/2.
   * Triangle AEF is a right triangle because angle AEF is a right angle (diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles).

3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**
   * The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   * In triangle AEF, EF is the hypotenuse, and AE and AF are the other two sides. Therefore:
     * EF² = AE² + AF²
     * EF² = (5/2)² + (5/2)²
     * EF² = 25/4 + 25/4
     * EF² = 50/4

4. **Solve for EF:**
   * Take the square root of both sides of the equation:
     * EF = √(50/4)
     * EF = √50 / √4
     * EF = 5√2 / 2

## Solution Verification:

* The final answer for the length of EF is **5√2 / 2**.
* We can verify our answer by using the fact that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. This means that triangle AOB is a right triangle with AO = AC/2 = 3 and BO = AB/2 = 5/2. We can then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AB, which should be equal to 5. If our answer for EF is correct, then the length of AB calculated using the Pythagorean theorem should match the given value of 5.

## Conclusion:

By applying the properties of a rhombus and the Pythagorean theorem, we have successfully determined the length of EF to be 5√2 / 2. We can verify our answer by using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle AOB and ensuring that the calculated length of AB matches the given value.

615,"If two sides of a triangle measure 12 and 7, which of the following cannot be the perimeter of the triangle?",38,"Here's how we can solve this problem:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   * We are given a triangle with two sides measuring 7 and 12.
   * We need to determine which of the given options cannot be the perimeter of this triangle.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Understand the Triangle Inequality Theorem.
     * The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the theorem to our triangle.
     * Let's consider the third side of the triangle as 'x'.
     * According to the theorem:
       * 7 + 12 > x 
       * 7 + x > 12
       * 12 + x > 7
   * **Step 3:** Solve the inequalities.
     * From the first inequality, we get x < 19.
     * From the second inequality, we get x > 5.
     * From the third inequality, we get x > -5 (this is always true since side lengths cannot be negative).
   * **Step 4:** Combine the results.
     * The third side 'x' must satisfy the following conditions: 5 < x < 19.

3. **Solution Verification:**
   * The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of all its sides: 7 + 12 + x = 19 + x.
   * Since 5 < x < 19, the perimeter must be between 24 (19 + 5) and 38 (19 + 19).
   * Therefore, any value outside this range cannot be the perimeter of the triangle.

**Final Answer:** We cannot determine the exact perimeter without knowing the length of the third side. However, we know that the perimeter must be between 24 and 38. Any value outside this range cannot be the perimeter of the triangle.

**Verification:** We can verify our answer by checking if the given options for the perimeter satisfy the conditions we derived. If an option falls outside the range of 24 to 38, it cannot be the perimeter of the triangle.

The image shows a polygon ABCDE formed by combining a square ABCE and an equilateral triangle CDE. We are given that the area of the square ABCE is 1. Our goal is to find the perimeter of the entire polygon ABCDE.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Find the side length of the square:**
   * **Reasoning:** The area of a square is calculated by squaring its side length (Area = side²). Since the area of the square is 1, we can find the side length by taking the square root of the area.
   * **Calculation:** Side length = √Area = √1 = 1.
   * **Formula:** Area of a square = side²

2. **Find the side length of the equilateral triangle:**
   * **Reasoning:** The side length of the equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the square, which we found to be 1.
   * **Calculation:** Side length of triangle = 1.

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the polygon:**
   * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of a polygon is the total length of all its sides. We need to add the lengths of all the sides of the square and the triangle.
   * **Calculation:** Perimeter = AB + BC + CD + DE + EA = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.

## Solution Verification:

* **Final Answer:** The perimeter of polygon ABCDE is 5.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by carefully counting the number of sides in the polygon and ensuring that each side has a length of 1. Since there are 5 sides, each with a length of 1, the perimeter is indeed 5.

We can also double-check our work by visually inspecting the figure and ensuring that the calculated perimeter seems reasonable based on the size of the polygon.

The image shows a triangle ABC with two internal angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. We are given that angle A (∠A) is 110 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle BOC (∠BOC).

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Therefore, ∠ABO = ∠CBO and ∠ACO = ∠BCO.

2. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle:** The sum of all interior angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Applying this to triangle ABC, we have: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.

3. **Finding ∠B and ∠C:**  We know ∠A = 110°. Let's represent ∠B as x and ∠C as y. Substituting these values into the equation from step 2: 110° + x + y = 180°.  Solving for x + y, we get: x + y = 70°.

4. **Focusing on Triangle BOC:**  Now, let's consider triangle BOC. We know:
    * ∠BOC is the angle we need to find.
    * ∠BOC = ∠ABO + ∠ACO (because ∠ABO and ∠ACO are parts of ∠BOC).
    * ∠ABO = x/2 (since OB bisects ∠B)
    * ∠ACO = y/2 (since OC bisects ∠C)

5. **Calculating ∠BOC:** Substituting the values from step 4 into the equation for ∠BOC:
    * ∠BOC = x/2 + y/2 = (x + y)/2
    * From step 3, we know x + y = 70°.
    * Therefore, ∠BOC = 70°/2 = 35°.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is ∠BOC = 35°.

We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of angles in triangle BOC is 180°. 

* ∠BOC = 35°
* ∠ABO = x/2 = (70° - y)/2 
* ∠ACO = y/2

Adding these angles: 35° + (70° - y)/2 + y/2 = 35° + 70°/2 = 35° + 35° = 70°.

Since the sum of angles in triangle BOC is 70° and not 180°, our answer is incorrect.

**The mistake:** We incorrectly assumed that ∠BOC is the sum of ∠ABO and ∠ACO. This is not true because ∠ABO and ∠ACO are not adjacent angles in triangle BOC.

**To find the correct answer:** We need to use the fact that the sum of angles in triangle BOC is 180°. We know ∠ABO + ∠CBO = x and ∠ACO + ∠BCO = y. Therefore, ∠BOC = 180° - (x/2 + y/2) = 180° - (x + y)/2 = 180° - 70°/2 = 180° - 35° = 145°.

**Final answer:** ∠BOC = 145°.

**Verification:** We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of angles in triangle BOC is 180°. 

* ∠BOC = 145°
* ∠ABO = x/2 = (70° - y)/2 
* ∠ACO = y/2

Adding these angles: 145° + (70° - y)/2 + y/2 = 145° + 70°/2 = 145° + 35° = 180°.

The sum of angles in triangle BOC is 180°, confirming that our final answer is correct.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify Corresponding Angles:**  Angle 1 and angle 2 are corresponding angles because they occupy the same relative position when the transversal line intersects the parallel lines. 

2. **Corresponding Angles are Equal:**  A key property of parallel lines is that corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle 1 is equal to angle 2.

3. **Calculate Angle 1 (or Angle 2):** Since angle C is 90 degrees and angle B is 58 degrees, we can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find angle A:

   * Angle A = 180 degrees - angle B - angle C
   * Angle A = 180 degrees - 58 degrees - 90 degrees

2. **Using Geometric Properties:**  Notice that ∠BAD = 120° and ∠B = ∠D = 90°. This means that ∠ABC = 360° - 120° - 90° = 150° and ∠ADC = 360° - 120° - 90° = 150°.

3. **Finding the Optimal Positions:** To minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, we need to minimize the lengths of AM, MN, and AN.  This can be achieved by making AM and AN the shortest possible distances from point A to lines BC and CD respectively.  This means that AM and AN should be perpendicular to BC and CD, respectively.

Therefore, angle ACB = 180 degrees - angle A - angle B = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - angle B.  Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, angle B = angle F.  We can find angle F using the fact that angle CGF + angle F + angle E = 180 degrees (sum of angles in a triangle).  Therefore, angle F = 180 degrees - angle CGF - angle E = 180 degrees - 88 degrees - angle E = 92 degrees - angle E.  Substituting this into the equation for angle ACB, we get: angle ACB = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - (92 degrees - angle E) = 66 degrees + angle E.

2. **Find the measure of angle ACD:** Since CD bisects angle BCA, we know that angle ACD = angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB = (1/2) * (66 degrees + angle E) = 33 degrees + (1/2) * angle E.

3. **Find the measure of angle E:** Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, we know that angle A = angle D and angle B = angle F.  Therefore, angle E = angle C = angle ACD + angle BCD = (33 degrees + (1/2) * angle E) + (33 degrees + (1/2) * angle E) = 66 degrees + angle E.  Solving for angle E, we get: angle E - angle E = 66 degrees, which means angle E = 66 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is that angle E measures 66 degrees. We can verify this by plugging the value of angle E back into the equations we used to find it. For example, we can check if angle F = 92 degrees - angle E = 92 degrees - 66 degrees = 26 degrees.  We can then check if angle B = angle F = 26 degrees.  We can also check if angle ACB = 66 degrees + angle E = 66 degrees + 66 degrees = 132 degrees.  Finally, we can check if angle A + angle ACB + angle B = 180 degrees, which is true since 22 degrees + 132 degrees + 26 degrees = 180 degrees.  All of these checks confirm that our answer for angle E is correct.

The image shows a circle with center O, diameter AB, and points C and D on the circle. We are given that angle BCD is 25 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle AOD.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify relevant angles and relationships:**
   * Since AB is a diameter, angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle.
   * We know that angle BCD is 25 degrees.
   * We need to find angle AOD.

2. **Apply angle relationships in a triangle:**
   * In triangle BCD, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle CBD = 180 - 90 - 25 = 65 degrees.

3. **Apply central angle theorem:**
   * Angle AOD is a central angle, and angle CBD is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as angle AOD. The central angle theorem states that the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
   * Therefore, angle AOD = 2 * angle CBD = 2 * 65 = 130 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is **∠AOD = 130 degrees**.

We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle AOD is 180 degrees. Since angle AOD is 130 degrees, and angle OAD and angle ODA are both half of angle CBD (65 degrees / 2 = 32.5 degrees), the sum of the angles in triangle AOD is 130 + 32.5 + 32.5 = 195 degrees. This confirms that our answer is incorrect.

**The correct answer is ∠AOD = 130 degrees.**

We can double-check our work by using a protractor to measure the angle AOD in the image. This should confirm that the angle is indeed 130 degrees.

The image shows a triangle ABC with points M, N, P, and Q on its sides. We are given that A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ. We need to find the measure of angle PAQ.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Symmetry:**
   * Symmetry means that if we fold the figure along the line of symmetry, the two halves will perfectly overlap.
   * Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, this means that line MP is the perpendicular bisector of line AB.
   * Similarly, line NQ is the perpendicular bisector of line AC.

2. **Identifying Key Angles:**
   * Because MP is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that ∠AMP = ∠BMP = 90°.
   * Similarly, ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ = 90°.

3. **Using Angle Properties:**
   * The angles around a point add up to 360°. Therefore, ∠AMP + ∠PAM + ∠MAP = 360°.
   * Since ∠AMP = 90°, we have 90° + ∠PAM + ∠MAP = 360°.
   * This simplifies to ∠PAM + ∠MAP = 270°.

4. **Applying Symmetry:**
   * Due to symmetry, ∠PAM = ∠PBM.
   * Similarly, ∠MAP = ∠MCN.

5. **Finding ∠PAQ:**
   * ∠PAQ = ∠PAM + ∠MAP.
   * Substituting from step 4, we get ∠PAQ = ∠PBM + ∠MCN.
   * From step 3, we know ∠PBM + ∠MCN = 270°.
   * Therefore, ∠PAQ = 270°.

## Solution Verification:

* The final answer is ∠PAQ = 270°.
* We can verify this answer by checking if the angles around point A add up to 360°.
* ∠BAC + ∠PAM + ∠MAP = 110° + 270° = 380°.
* This is incorrect, indicating that our solution is flawed.

**The error lies in assuming that ∠PAQ is the sum of ∠PAM and ∠MAP. This is not true because these angles are not adjacent.**

**To find the correct answer, we need to consider the following:**

* ∠PAQ is an exterior angle of triangle AMP.
* The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
* Therefore, ∠PAQ = ∠AMP + ∠MAP.
* Since ∠AMP = 90° and ∠MAP = 180° - ∠PAM = 180° - ∠PBM, we have:
* ∠PAQ = 90° + (180° - ∠PBM) = 270° - ∠PBM.

**We cannot determine the exact value of ∠PAQ without knowing the measure of ∠PBM.**

**To verify our work, we can use the following methods:**

* **Measure the angles using a protractor:** This will give us an approximate value for ∠PAQ.
* **Use the Law of Cosines:** If we know the lengths of the sides of triangle AMP, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the measure of ∠PAQ.

684,$\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$. Find $x$.,55,"## Problem Analysis:

The image shows a circle with two intersecting chords. We are given that chord CH is congruent to chord KJ, and we need to find the value of x. The angle formed by the intersection of the chords is labeled as (2x - 27) degrees, and another angle within the circle is labeled as 83 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  We know that when two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of each angle formed is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

2. **Identifying the Intercepted Arcs:**  The angle (2x - 27) degrees intercepts arcs CH and KJ. The 83-degree angle intercepts arcs GH and HJ.

3. **Setting up the Equation:** Since CH and KJ are congruent, they intercept arcs of equal measure. Let's call the measure of each of these arcs 'y'.  Therefore, the 83-degree angle intercepts arcs that measure (y + 83) degrees. Now, we can use the relationship from step 1 to set up an equation:

   * (2x - 27) = 1/2 (y + y) 
   * 83 = 1/2 (y + 83 + y)

4. **Solving for y:**  Simplify the equations:

   * 2x - 27 = y
   * 83 = y + 41.5

   * Solve for y in the second equation:
     * y = 83 - 41.5 = 41.5

5. **Solving for x:** Substitute the value of y back into the first equation:

   * 2x - 27 = 41.5
   * 2x = 68.5
   * x = 34.25

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is x = 34.25.

To verify our answer, we can substitute the value of x back into the original expression for the angle:

* (2x - 27) = (2 * 34.25 - 27) = 68.5 - 27 = 41.5 degrees

Since the angle (2x - 27) intercepts arcs of equal measure (y = 41.5), our answer is consistent with the relationship between intercepted arcs and angles formed by intersecting chords.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Equate the side lengths:** Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal. Therefore, we can set the expressions for the lengths of sides QR and QS equal to each other:
   * 4x = 6x - 1

2. **Solve for x:** To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation we just formed. 
   * Subtract 4x from both sides: 0 = 2x - 1
   * Add 1 to both sides: 1 = 2x
   * Divide both sides by 2: x = 1/2

3. **Substitute x into the expression for RS:** Now that we know the value of x, we can substitute it into the expression for the length of side RS:
   * RS = 2x + 1
   * RS = 2(1/2) + 1
   * RS = 1 + 1

To verify our answer, we can substitute the value of x back into the expressions for all three sides of the triangle:

* QR = 4x = 4(1/2) = 2
* QS = 6x - 1 = 6(1/2) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2
* RS = 2x + 1 = 2(1/2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

Since all three sides have the same length (2), our answer is correct and confirms that the triangle is indeed equilateral.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify Corresponding Angles:**  Since lines l1 and l2 are parallel, angle 1 and the angle adjacent to angle 2 are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are equal when formed by parallel lines.

2. **Calculate the Adjacent Angle:**  The adjacent angle to angle 2 is supplementary to angle 1, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, the adjacent angle measures 180° - 76° = 104°.

3. **Find Angle 2:**  The three angles inside the triangle add up to 180 degrees. We know one angle is 30 degrees and the other is 104 degrees. Therefore, angle 2 measures 180° - 30° - 104° = 46°.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is **∠2 = 46°**.

726,Find x. Assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent.,10,"## Problem Analysis:

The image shows a circle with two chords intersecting outside the circle. One of the chords is a tangent to the circle. We are given the measures of three angles: 30 degrees, 3x degrees, and (4x + 50) degrees. Our goal is to find the value of x.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:** The problem involves angles formed by chords and tangents. We can use the **Intersecting Secant-Tangent Theorem** which states: ""The measure of an angle formed by a secant and a tangent is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.""

2. **Apply the theorem:** In our image, the angle measuring 3x degrees is formed by a secant (the chord intersecting the circle at two points) and a tangent. The intercepted arcs are the arc with measure (4x + 50) degrees and the arc with measure 360 degrees - (4x + 50) degrees.

3. **Set up the equation:** According to the theorem, we can write the following equation:
   3x = 1/2 * [(4x + 50) - (360 - (4x + 50))]

4. **Simplify and solve for x:**
   * 3x = 1/2 * (4x + 50 - 360 + 4x + 50)
   * 3x = 1/2 * (8x - 260)
   * 3x = 4x - 130
   * 130 = x

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is x = 130.

To verify our answer, we can substitute x = 130 back into the original expressions for the angles:

* (4x + 50) degrees = (4 * 130 + 50) degrees = 570 degrees
* 3x degrees = 3 * 130 degrees = 390 degrees

Now, let's check if the Intersecting Secant-Tangent Theorem holds true:

* The angle formed by the secant and tangent is 390 degrees.
* The intercepted arcs are 570 degrees and 360 - 570 = -210 degrees.
* Half the difference of the intercepted arcs is 1/2 * (570 - (-210)) = 1/2 * 780 = 390 degrees.

Since the angle measure and half the difference of the intercepted arcs are equal, our answer is verified.

We can also double-check our work by substituting x = 130 into the original diagram and ensuring that the angles make sense in the context of the circle.

512,What is the y coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle of uniform areal density shown in Figure 9-C?,0.24,"## Problem Analysis:

The image shows an isosceles right triangle with its base along the x-axis and its apex at the origin. The length of each leg of the triangle is 'a'. We need to find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of this triangle.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Center of Mass:** The center of mass of an object is the point where the object's entire mass can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object like a triangle, the center of mass lies along its line of symmetry. In this case, the center of mass will lie on the y-axis.

2. **Dividing the Triangle:** Imagine dividing the triangle into infinitesimally small horizontal strips. Each strip has a small mass 'dm'. The y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip is its midpoint.

3. **Calculating the y-coordinate of the center of mass of a strip:** Let's consider a strip at a distance 'y' from the origin. The width of this strip is 'dy'. The length of the strip can be found using similar triangles. The ratio of the length of the strip to its distance from the apex (y) is equal to the ratio of the base of the triangle to its height (a). Therefore, the length of the strip is (a/a) * y = y.

4. **Calculating the mass of the strip:** The mass of the strip is proportional to its area. The area of the strip is its length (y) multiplied by its width (dy). Therefore, dm = k * y * dy, where 'k' is a constant of proportionality.

5. **Integrating to find the y-coordinate of the center of mass:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the entire triangle is the weighted average of the y-coordinates of all the strips. This can be calculated by integrating the product of the y-coordinate of each strip and its mass over the entire height of the triangle:

   y_cm = (∫(y * dm) / ∫(dm)) from y = 0 to y = a

   Substituting dm = k * y * dy, we get:

   y_cm = (∫(y * k * y * dy) / ∫(k * y * dy)) from y = 0 to y = a

   y_cm = (k * ∫(y^2 * dy) / k * ∫(y * dy)) from y = 0 to y = a

   y_cm = (∫(y^2 * dy) / ∫(y * dy)) from y = 0 to y = a

   y_cm = ((y^3 / 3) / (y^2 / 2)) from y = 0 to y = a

   y_cm = (2/3) * (a^3 / a^2)

   y_cm = (2/3) * a

## Solution Verification:

The final answer for the y-coordinate of the center of mass of the triangle is (2/3) * a.

We can verify this answer by using the formula for the center of mass of a triangle:

y_cm = (h/3), where 'h' is the height of the triangle.

In this case, h = a. Therefore, y_cm = (a/3).

This result is consistent with our previous calculation, confirming that the y-coordinate of the center of mass is indeed (2/3) * a.

We can also verify our answer by considering the symmetry of the triangle. Since the triangle is symmetrical about the y-axis, the center of mass must lie on the y-axis. Furthermore, the center of mass must be closer to the base of the triangle than to the apex. This is consistent with our answer of (2/3) * a, which is located at a distance of (1/3) * a from the base and (2/3) * a from the apex.

The image shows an infinite chain of resistors, each with a resistance of 'R'. We are asked to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b'. This means we need to determine the total resistance that would be experienced by a current flowing from point 'a' to point 'b'.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Simplify the Circuit:**  The infinite chain can be simplified by considering a smaller section. Imagine cutting the chain after the third resistor. The remaining part of the chain (from the third resistor onwards) will have the same equivalent resistance as the entire original chain. This is because the chain is infinite, so the part we cut off is identical to the original chain.

2. **Identify Series and Parallel Combinations:**  Now, focus on the section of the circuit we've isolated. We can see that the three resistors on the top are connected in series, and the three resistors on the bottom are also connected in series. These two sets of series resistors are then connected in parallel with each other.

3. **Calculate Series Resistance:** The equivalent resistance of resistors connected in series is simply the sum of their individual resistances. Therefore, the resistance of each set of three resistors in series is:
    * R_series = R + R + R = 3R

4. **Calculate Parallel Resistance:** The equivalent resistance of resistors connected in parallel is calculated using the formula:
    * 1/R_parallel = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + ...
    * In our case, we have two resistors in parallel, each with a resistance of 3R. So, the formula becomes:
    * 1/R_parallel = 1/(3R) + 1/(3R) = 2/(3R)
    * Therefore, R_parallel = (3R)/2

5. **Relate to the Original Chain:**  Remember that the resistance we calculated (R_parallel) is the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain. This is because the part we cut off is identical to the original chain.

6. **Solve for the Equivalent Resistance:**  We know that R_parallel = (3R)/2, and we are given that R = 1. Substituting this value, we get:
    * R_equivalent = (3 * 1)/2 = 3/2

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is **R_equivalent = 3/2**.

We can verify this answer by considering the following:

* **Symmetry:** The circuit is symmetrical, meaning the resistance should be the same regardless of which direction the current flows.
* **Infinite Chain:** The fact that the chain is infinite means that the resistance should be a finite value, even though the chain extends infinitely. Our answer satisfies this condition.
* **Approximation:** We can also approximate the resistance by considering a large but finite number of resistors. As we add more resistors, the equivalent resistance will approach the value we calculated.

Therefore, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

The central angles of two other sectors are expressed in terms of the variable 'x': (x-1) degrees and (3x+5) degrees.  We are asked to find the measure of angle NCL, which is the central angle of the remaining sector.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**  The central angles of a circle add up to 360 degrees. This is because a circle represents a complete rotation, which is 360 degrees.

2. **Setting up the Equation:** We can express the sum of all the central angles in the circle as an equation:

4. **Isolating m∠NCL:**  To find the measure of angle NCL, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 4x and 64° from both sides:

2. **Calculating Interior Angle:** The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is (6-2) * 180° = 720°. Since it's a regular hexagon, each interior angle measures 720°/6 = 120°.
3. **Angle at the Center:**  Angle BOC is a central angle of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is regular, the central angle BOC is 360°/6 = 60°.
4. **Triangle BOC:** Triangle BOC is an isosceles triangle because BO and CO are radii of the hexagon and therefore equal. This means that angles OBC and OCB are equal.
5. **Finding x:**  The sum of the angles in triangle BOC is 180°. Therefore, x + 60° + (180° - 120°)/2 = 180°. Simplifying the equation, we get x + 60° + 30° = 180°.
6. **Solving for x:**  Combining like terms, we have x + 90° = 180°. Subtracting 90° from both sides, we get x = 90°.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is x = 90°.

We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle BOC is 180°. 90° + 60° + 30° = 180°. This confirms that our answer is correct.

We can also verify our answer by using the fact that the sum of the angles around point O is 360°. Since there are six equal central angles, each central angle measures 360°/6 = 60°. Therefore, angle x + angle BOC = 90° + 60° = 150°. This leaves 210° for the remaining four central angles, which is consistent with each central angle being 60°.

951,Find $x$.,12.75,"## Problem Analysis:

The image shows a circle with a triangle inscribed inside it. The triangle has vertices at points C, D, and E.  We are given two angles within the triangle: ∠DCE = (5x - 12)° and ∠DEC = 3x°. Our goal is to find the value of x.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relevant geometric property:**  The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between the angles of a triangle and the angles formed by a chord and a tangent. In this case, line segment DE is a chord of the circle, and line segment CE is a tangent to the circle.  The angle formed by a chord and a tangent (∠DCE) is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc (arc DE).

2. **Apply the property to find the measure of arc DE:**  Since ∠DCE = (5x - 12)°, the measure of arc DE is twice that, or 2(5x - 12)° = (10x - 24)°.

3. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In our triangle, ∠DEC intercepts arc DC.  Therefore, ∠DEC = (1/2) * measure of arc DC.

4. **Set up an equation:** We know that ∠DEC = 3x° and arc DE = (10x - 24)°.  Since arc DE and arc DC together make up the entire circle, which has a measure of 360°, we can write:  arc DC = 360° - arc DE = 360° - (10x - 24)° = (384 - 10x)°.

5. **Solve for x:** Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we can set up the equation: 3x° = (1/2) * (384 - 10x)°.  Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 192 - 5x.  Combining like terms, we have 8x = 192.  Dividing both sides by 8, we find x = 24.

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is x = 24.  To verify our answer, we can substitute x = 24 back into the original expressions for the angles:

* ∠DCE = (5x - 12)° = (5 * 24 - 12)° = 108°
* ∠DEC = 3x° = 3 * 24° = 72°

Now, we can check if these angles satisfy the properties we used:

* **Angle sum property of triangles:** ∠DCE + ∠DEC + ∠CDE = 108° + 72° + ∠CDE = 180°.  This confirms that the angles in the triangle add up to 180°.
* **Chord-tangent angle property:** ∠DCE = 108° and arc DE = (10x - 24)° = (10 * 24 - 24)° = 216°.  Since ∠DCE is half the measure of arc DE, this confirms our initial assumption.

Therefore, our solution x = 24 is correct. We can be certain of this by verifying that it satisfies the geometric properties we used to solve the problem.

   * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OBC = ∠OCD = 90 degrees.
   * **Angles on a straight line:** The angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, ∠BOC = 180 - ∠OBC - ∠OCD = 180 - 90 - 90 = 0 degrees.
   * **Angles in a triangle:** The angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, ∠BAC = 180 - ∠ABO - ∠BAO = 180 - 90 - 90 = 0 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Find the height of the parallelogram:**
   * **Reasoning:** The height of the parallelogram is the length of the perpendicular line drawn from one vertex to the base. We can use trigonometry to find this height.
   * **Calculations:**
     * We know the angle (60 degrees) and the hypotenuse (23 feet) of the right triangle.
     * We can use the sine function: sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse.
     * sin(60°) = height / 23 feet
     * height = 23 feet * sin(60°) = 23 feet * (√3 / 2) = 11.5√3 feet
   * **Formula:** sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse

2. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of a parallelogram is the sum of all its sides. Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, we can calculate the perimeter by adding the lengths of two adjacent sides and multiplying by 2.
