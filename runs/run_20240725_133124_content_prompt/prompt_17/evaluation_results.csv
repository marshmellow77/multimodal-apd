17,如图，在Rt△ABC中，∠ACB＝90°，D是AB的中点，AB＝10，则CD的长为（）,5,"**解题思路：**

1. 因为D是AB的中点，所以AD=BD=AB/2=5。
2. 因为∠ACB=90°，所以△ACD和△BCD都是直角三角形。
3. 根据勾股定理，我们可以求出CD的长。

**解题步骤：**

在Rt△ACD中，根据勾股定理，有：

CD² = AD² + AC²

在Rt△BCD中，根据勾股定理，有：

CD² = BD² + BC²

因为AD=BD=5，所以：

CD² = 5² + AC² = 5² + BC²

所以，AC² = BC²，即AC=BC。

因为△ABC是直角三角形，所以AC² + BC² = AB² = 10² = 100。

所以，AC² = BC² = 50。

所以，CD² = 5² + 50 = 75。

所以，CD = √75 = 5√3。

**1. Understand the Formula**

The area of a rhombus is given by:

Area = (1/2) * (diagonal 1) * (diagonal 2)

**2. Set Up the Equations**

* Let 'd' be the length of the shorter diagonal.
* The longer diagonal is twice the length of the shorter diagonal, so it's 2d.

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a quadrilateral ABCD with specific angle measures. We need to find points M and N on BC and CD respectively, such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized.  Then, we need to determine the sum of angles AMN and ANM.

**Solution**

1. **Symmetry:**  Notice that the problem has symmetry.  Since ∠BAD = 120° and ∠B = ∠D = 90°, we can reflect the figure across line AD. This reflection will create a congruent quadrilateral, and the corresponding points M and N will also be reflected.

2. **Minimizing Perimeter:**  The perimeter of triangle AMN will be minimized when points M and N are the reflections of each other across line AD. This is because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

3. **Angle Calculation:**  Since M and N are reflections, line AMN is a straight line. Therefore, ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 180°.

The degree of ∠AMN + ∠ANM is **180**.

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

5x = 8

Since $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$, we know that $m\stackrel{\frown}{CH} = m\stackrel{\frown}{KJ}$.  Also, the measure of the entire circle is $360^\circ$, so we have:

$$m\stackrel{\frown}{CH} + m\stackrel{\frown}{KJ} + 83^\circ = 360^\circ$$

Solving for $m\stackrel{\frown}{KJ}$, we get:

Substituting this into our first equation, we get:

**Understanding the Geometry**

* **Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem:** The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

**Applying the Theorems**

1. **Angle formed by tangent and chord:** The angle with measure (4x + 50)° is formed by a tangent and a chord.  The intercepted arc is the entire circle, which has a measure of 360°.  Therefore:
   (4x + 50)° = (1/2) * 360°
   4x + 50 = 180

2. **Inscribed angle:** The angle with measure 3x° is an inscribed angle. Its intercepted arc is the same arc intercepted by the angle with measure (4x + 50)°.  Therefore:
   3x° = (1/2) * (4x + 50)°
   3x = 2x + 25

**Solving for x**

1. **Solve the first equation:**
   4x + 50 = 180
   4x = 130
   x = 32.5

2. **Check the second equation (optional):**

Here's why:

* **Symmetry:** Due to the symmetry of the triangle, the center of mass lies along the vertical line of symmetry.
* **Center of Mass Formula:** For a continuous object, the y-coordinate of the center of mass is given by:

   y_cm = (∫y*dA) / (∫dA)

   where:
    * y is the vertical distance from the base of the triangle
    * dA is an infinitesimal area element
    * The integrals are taken over the entire area of the triangle.

* **Integration:**  We can simplify the calculation by considering a thin horizontal strip of width dy at a distance y from the base. The area of this strip is dA = (2a - 2y/a) * dy.  

   Substituting this into the formula and integrating from y = 0 to y = a, we get:

   y_cm = (∫(y * (2a - 2y/a) * dy)) / (∫(2a - 2y/a) * dy)

   Solving the integrals, we find y_cm = a/3.

252,Consider the infinitely long chain of resistors shown below. What is the resistance between terminals a and b if R=1?,0.73,"The resistance between terminals a and b is **2**.

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Symmetry:** The circuit is symmetrical. This means that the resistance between any two adjacent nodes is the same.

2. **Equivalent Resistance:**  Let's consider the resistance between nodes a and the first node to the right of a. This resistance is the sum of the resistance of the top resistor (R) and the resistance of the equivalent circuit to the right of that node.

3. **Recursive Relationship:** The equivalent resistance to the right of the first node is the same as the resistance between terminals a and b (since the circuit is infinite). Let's call this resistance 'x'.

4. **Equation:** We can now write an equation for the resistance between a and the first node:

   x = R + (R || x)

   where '||' denotes parallel resistance.

5. **Solving for x:**

   x = 1 + (1 || x)
   x = 1 + (x / (1 + x))
   x(1 + x) = 1 + x + x
   x^2 + x - 1 - 2x = 0
   x^2 - x - 1 = 0

   Solving this quadratic equation gives us two solutions:

   x = (1 ± √5) / 2

   Since resistance cannot be negative, we take the positive solution:

   x = (1 + √5) / 2 ≈ 1.618

6. **Final Resistance:** The resistance between terminals a and b is the sum of the resistance of the top resistor (R) and the equivalent resistance 'x':

   R + x = 1 + (1 + √5) / 2 = (3 + √5) / 2 ≈ 2

Therefore, the resistance between terminals a and b is approximately **2**.

* **Central Angles:**  The central angles formed by connecting the center of the hexagon to two consecutive vertices are all equal. Since there are 6 sides, each central angle measures 360 degrees / 6 = 60 degrees.

**Solving for x**

1. **Angle BOC:**  Angle BOC is a central angle of the hexagon, so it measures 60 degrees.
