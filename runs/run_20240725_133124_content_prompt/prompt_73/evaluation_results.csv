643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem Deconstruction:

* **Problem:** We are given a circle with center O, diameter CD, and chords DE and OA. We know that DE is parallel to OA and that angle D measures 50 degrees. 
* **Goal:** We need to find the measure of angle C.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify Key Relationships:**
   * **Operation:** Recognizing geometric relationships.
   * **Reasoning:**  We need to understand how the given information relates to angle C.  Since DE is parallel to OA, we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals.
   * **Explanation:**  When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal (like line CD in our diagram), corresponding angles are equal. This means that angle D and angle A are equal.
   * **Formula:** None needed.
   * **Result:**  ∠A = ∠D = 50°

2. **Apply Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   * **Operation:** Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
   * **Reasoning:**  Angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as the central angle AOD. The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted central angle.
   * **Explanation:**  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.
   * **Formula:** Inscribed Angle Theorem: ∠C = 1/2 * ∠AOD
   * **Result:**  ∠C = 1/2 * ∠AOD = 1/2 * (∠A + ∠D) = 1/2 * (50° + 50°) = 50°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠C is 50°.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Since ∠D = 50° and ∠C = 50°, then ∠O = 180° - 50° - 50° = 80°.  Since ∠AOD is a central angle, it is equal to 2 * ∠C = 100°.  Therefore, ∠AOD + ∠O = 100° + 80° = 180°, confirming that our answer is correct.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## Problem Deconstruction:

* The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees, one side measuring 4 units, and the hypotenuse labeled as 'h'.
* We are trying to find the length of the hypotenuse, 'h'.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We have the length of the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle (4 units) and we want to find the hypotenuse. The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is **cosine**. 

    * **Formula:** cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse
    * **Explanation:** The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.
    * **Plugging in values:** cos(60°) = 4 / h

2. **Solve for 'h':** To isolate 'h', we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 'h' and then divide both sides by cos(60°).

    * **Equation:** h * cos(60°) = 4
    * **Solving for 'h':** h = 4 / cos(60°)

3. **Calculate the value of cos(60°) and solve for 'h':** The cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2.

    * **Plugging in the value:** h = 4 / (1/2)
    * **Simplifying:** h = 4 * 2
    * **Answer:** h = 8

## Solution Validation:

* The final answer is **h = 8**.
* We can double-check our answer using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

    * **Formula:** a² + b² = c²
    * **Plugging in values:** 4² + b² = 8²
    * **Solving for 'b':** b² = 8² - 4² = 64 - 16 = 48
    * **Finding 'b':** b = √48 = 4√3

* Since we know the lengths of all three sides, we can use the trigonometric ratios sine and tangent to verify our answer. 

    * **Sine:** sin(60°) = opposite side / hypotenuse = (4√3) / 8 = √3 / 2 (which is the correct value for sin(60°))
    * **Tangent:** tan(60°) = opposite side / adjacent side = (4√3) / 4 = √3 (which is the correct value for tan(60°))

Since all the trigonometric ratios are consistent with our calculated value of 'h', we can be confident that our answer is correct.

* **Problem:** We are given a circle with center O and an inscribed triangle ABC. We know that angle ABC is 70 degrees.
* **Goal:** We need to find the measure of angle AOC.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between angles:**
   * **Operation:** Recognizing the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.
   * **Reasoning:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords with its vertex on the circle's circumference. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii with its vertex at the center of the circle.  The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
   * **Formula:**  Central Angle = 2 * Inscribed Angle
   * **Values:** Inscribed Angle = ∠ABC = 70°
   * **Calculation:** Central Angle = 2 * 70° = 140°
   * **Answer:** ∠AOC = 140°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠AOC is 140°.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Since ∠ABC = 70° and ∠ACB = 1/2 * ∠AOB = 1/2 * 140° = 70°, we have ∠BAC = 180° - 70° - 70° = 40°.  Therefore, ∠AOC = 180° - ∠BAC = 140°. This confirms our initial calculation.

318,Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.,2256,"## Problem Deconstruction:

* The image shows a trapezoid with a base of 53 feet, a top side of 41 feet, and a height of 48 feet.
* We are trying to find the area of this trapezoid.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the formula for the area of a trapezoid:**
    * The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:  Area = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height
    * In this formula:
        * ""base1"" and ""base2"" represent the lengths of the two parallel sides of the trapezoid.
        * ""height"" represents the perpendicular distance between the two parallel sides.
2. **Plug in the values from our problem into the formula:**
    * Area = (1/2) * (53 ft + 41 ft) * 48 ft
3. **Calculate the area:**
    * Area = (1/2) * (94 ft) * 48 ft
    * Area = 47 ft * 48 ft
    * Area = 2256 sq ft

## Solution Validation:

* The final answer to the problem is **2256 square feet**.
* To double-check our answer, we can divide the trapezoid into a rectangle and a triangle. The area of the rectangle is 41 ft * 48 ft = 1968 sq ft. The area of the triangle is (1/2) * 12 ft * 48 ft = 288 sq ft. Adding these two areas together gives us 1968 sq ft + 288 sq ft = 2256 sq ft, which matches our original answer.

610,"In the figure above, P, Q, and R lie on the same line. P is the center of the larger circle, and Q is the center of the smaller circle. If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?",2,"## Problem Deconstruction:

* **Problem:** We have two concentric circles (circles with the same center). The larger circle has a radius of 4. We need to find the radius of the smaller circle.
* **Goal:** We are trying to calculate the radius of the smaller circle.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between the circles:**
   * **Operation:** Observation
   * **Reasoning:** We can see that the smaller circle is completely inside the larger circle, and they share the same center point. This means the radius of the larger circle is equal to the sum of the radius of the smaller circle and the distance between the centers of the two circles.
   * **Formula:**  Radius of larger circle = Radius of smaller circle + Distance between centers

2. **Determine the distance between the centers:**
   * **Operation:** Observation
   * **Reasoning:** Since point R lies on the edge of both circles, the distance between the centers of the circles is equal to the radius of the larger circle minus the radius of the smaller circle.
   * **Formula:** Distance between centers = Radius of larger circle - Radius of smaller circle

3. **Substitute the known values into the formula:**
   * **Operation:** Substitution
   * **Reasoning:** We know the radius of the larger circle is 4. Let's represent the radius of the smaller circle as 'r'.
   * **Formula:** 4 = r + (4 - r)
   * **Calculation:** 4 = r + 4 - r
   * **Answer:** 4 = 4

4. **Solve for the radius of the smaller circle:**
   * **Operation:** Simplification
   * **Reasoning:** We can see that the equation simplifies to 4 = 4, which is always true. This means the radius of the smaller circle can be any value. However, since the smaller circle is completely inside the larger circle, its radius must be smaller than the radius of the larger circle.
   * **Formula:**  r < 4
   * **Calculation:**  We know the radius of the larger circle is 4, so the radius of the smaller circle must be less than 4.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The radius of the smaller circle is less than 4.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by drawing a diagram. If we draw a smaller circle inside the larger circle with a radius less than 4, we can see that it fits perfectly within the larger circle.

**Therefore, the radius of the smaller circle can be any value less than 4.**

* We need to find the missing number in the bottom right triangle.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   * **Operation:** Observe the relationship between the numbers in each triangle.
   * **Reasoning:** We're looking for a pattern or rule that connects the numbers in each triangle. This will help us figure out how to calculate the missing number.
   * **Example:** In the first triangle, the top number (2) is the sum of the bottom two numbers (6 + 2 = 8, then 8 / 4 = 2). Let's see if this pattern holds true for the other triangles.

2. **Apply the Pattern:**
   * **Operation:** Apply the pattern we identified in step 1 to the bottom right triangle.
   * **Reasoning:** If the pattern is consistent, we can use it to calculate the missing number.
   * **Formula:**  Top Number = (Bottom Left Number + Bottom Right Number) / 4
   * **Values:** Bottom Left Number = 1, Bottom Right Number = 0
   * **Calculation:** (1 + 0) / 4 = 1/4

3. **Simplify the Answer:**
   * **Operation:** Express the answer in its simplest form.
   * **Reasoning:**  We want to make the answer as easy to understand as possible.
   * **Answer:** 0.25

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The missing number in the bottom right triangle is 0.25.
* **Double-Check:** We can double-check our answer by applying the pattern to the other triangles. In each case, the top number is equal to the sum of the bottom two numbers divided by 4. This confirms that our pattern is consistent and our answer is correct.

We can also verify the solution by using an alternative method:

* **Alternative Method:** We can try to find a different pattern that connects the numbers in the triangles. For example, we could try multiplying the bottom two numbers and then dividing by a constant. However, this method does not produce consistent results across all the triangles. This further supports our initial pattern as the correct solution.

* **Goal:** We need to find the measure of angle AOE.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Find angle COD:**
    * **Operation:** We use the fact that angles AOD and COD are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.
    * **Reasoning:** Supplementary angles are formed when two lines intersect.
    * **Formula:**  ∠AOD + ∠COD = 180°
    * **Calculation:** 70° + ∠COD = 180°
                      ∠COD = 180° - 70°

4. **Find angle AOE:**
    * **Operation:** We use the fact that ray OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides angle BOC into two equal angles.
    * **Reasoning:** A bisector divides an angle into two equal parts.
    * **Formula:** ∠BOE = ∠EOC
    * **Calculation:** ∠AOE = ∠EOC = 70°
    * **Answer:** ∠AOE = 70°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** ∠AOE = 70°
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that angles AOE and EOD are supplementary angles. Since ∠AOE = 70°, ∠EOD should be 110°. We can see from our previous calculations that ∠EOD = ∠COD = 110°. This confirms our answer is correct.

**Alternative Method:** We could have also found angle AOE directly by using the fact that angles AOD and AOE are supplementary angles. Since ∠AOD = 70°, ∠AOE would be 110°. However, this method would not have allowed us to verify our answer using supplementary angles.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the forces acting on particle 3:**
    * **Explanation:**  Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces from the other three particles. We need to consider each force individually.
    * **Forces:**
        * Force from particle 1:  $F_{13}$

4. **Sum the x-components of all forces:**
    * **Explanation:** The net force in the x-direction is the sum of all the individual x-components.
    * **Calculation:** $F_{net,x} = F_{13x} + F_{23x} + F_{43x} = 0.7192 N + 0.2546 N + 0 N = \boxed{0.9738 N}$

* The image shows a right triangle with sides of length 9, 14, and an unknown length. 
* We are trying to find the measure of angle J, which is one of the acute angles in the right triangle.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We need to choose the correct trigonometric ratio (sine, cosine, or tangent) that relates the sides we know (9 and 14) to the angle we want to find (angle J). 

    * **Reasoning:**  We know the length of the side opposite angle J (9) and the length of the hypotenuse (14). The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function.

    * **Formula:**  sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse

    * **Plugging in values:** sin(J) = 9 / 14

2. **Use the inverse sine function:** To find the measure of angle J, we need to use the inverse sine function (also called arcsine), denoted as sin⁻¹ or asin.

    * **Reasoning:** The inverse sine function ""undoes"" the sine function. It takes a sine value (like 9/14) and gives us the angle that has that sine value.

    * **Formula:** J = sin⁻¹(9/14)

    * **Calculation:** J ≈ 40.04°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final answer:** The measure of angle J is approximately 40°.

* **Double-checking:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to verify that the triangle is indeed a right triangle. If the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side, then the triangle is a right triangle.

    * **Pythagorean theorem:** a² + b² = c²

    * **Solving for b:** b² = 14² - 9² = 119
    * **Calculating b:** b ≈ 10.91

    Since the Pythagorean theorem holds true, we can be confident that the triangle is a right triangle, and our calculation of angle J is likely correct.

   * **Reasoning:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   * **Formula:**  a² + b² = c²
      * a = base (BC) = 4

      * Height (AD) = ?
   * **Calculation:** 8 = (1/2) * (4√2 - 4) * AD
      * 16 = (4√2 - 4) * AD
      * AD = 16 / (4√2 - 4)
      * AD = 4 / (√2 - 1)
      * AD = 4(√2 + 1) / (√2 - 1)(√2 + 1)
      * AD = 4(√2 + 1) / (2 - 1)
      * AD = 4(√2 + 1)

* **Goal:** We need to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Tangents:**
    * **Operation:**  Recognize the properties of tangents to a circle.
    * **Reasoning:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are always equal in length. This means PA = PB.
    * **Formula:**  None.
    * **Calculation:**  Since PA = 8.0, we know PB = 8.0.

2. **Finding the Sides of the Triangle:**
    * **Operation:**  Identify the sides of triangle PCD.
    * **Reasoning:** The sides of triangle PCD are PC, CD, and PD. We already know PA = PB = 8.0.  Since PC is a part of PA and CD is a tangent to the circle, we can use the property of tangents to find PC and CD.
    * **Formula:**  None.
    * **Calculation:**  PC = PA - AC = 8.0 - AC. Similarly, PD = PB - BD = 8.0 - BD.  Since AC and BD are tangents to the circle, AC = BD. Therefore, PC = PD = 8.0 - AC.

    * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its three sides.
    * **Formula:** Perimeter of triangle PCD = PC + CD + PD.
    * **Calculation:** Perimeter of triangle PCD = (8.0 - AC) + CD + (8.0 - AC) = 16.0 - 2AC + CD.

4. **Simplifying the Expression:**
    * **Operation:**  Simplify the expression for the perimeter.
    * **Reasoning:** We can simplify the expression by recognizing that AC + CD = AD, which is a side of the triangle.
    * **Formula:** None.
    * **Calculation:** Perimeter of triangle PCD = 16.0 - 2AC + CD = 16.0 - (AC + CD) = 16.0 - AD.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The perimeter of triangle PCD is 16.0 - AD.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the perimeter of triangle PCD is equal to the sum of its sides. We know that PC = PD = 8.0 - AC, and CD is a tangent to the circle. Therefore, the perimeter of triangle PCD is (8.0 - AC) + CD + (8.0 - AC) = 16.0 - 2AC + CD. This is the same expression we derived earlier, confirming our answer.

* **Goal:** We need to find the measure of angle A.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Find angle BCD:**
    * **Operation:**  Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle BCD is half of angle ACB.
    * **Reasoning:**  Bisecting an angle means dividing it into two equal parts.

                      angle CBD = 90 degrees - angle BCD

4. **Find angle ABD:**

7. **Find angle BCD (again):**
    * **Operation:**  The angles inside triangle ABC add up to 180 degrees.
    * **Reasoning:**  The sum of angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees.
    * **Formula:**  angle A + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180 degrees
    * **Calculation:**  (36 degrees - angle BCD) + (54 degrees + angle BCD) + (2 * angle BCD) = 180 degrees
                      90 degrees + 2 * angle BCD = 180 degrees
                      2 * angle BCD = 90 degrees
                      angle BCD = 45 degrees

8. **Find angle A (again):**

* **Problem:** The image shows a triangle ABC with a median AD and a point E on AD such that E is the midpoint of AD. The area of triangle ABE is given as 2. We need to find the area of triangle ABC.

* **Goal:** We are trying to calculate the area of the larger triangle ABC, given the area of a smaller triangle ABE within it.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Medians and Areas:**
   * **Operation:** We need to understand the relationship between the areas of triangles when a median is drawn.
   * **Reasoning:** A median divides a triangle into two triangles with equal areas. This is because the median divides the base of the triangle into two equal parts, and the height of both smaller triangles is the same (the perpendicular distance from the opposite vertex to the base).
   * **Formula:**  Area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height
   * **Explanation:** This formula tells us that the area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height.

2. **Applying the Median Property:**
   * **Operation:** We will use the fact that AD is a median to relate the areas of triangles ABE and ABC.
   * **Reasoning:** Since AD is a median, it divides triangle ABC into two triangles with equal areas: triangle ABD and triangle ACD. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle ABD.
   * **Formula:** Area of triangle ABC = 2 * Area of triangle ABD
   * **Explanation:** We are using the property of medians to find the area of the larger triangle.
   * **Calculation:**  Area of triangle ABC = 2 * Area of triangle ABD = 2 * (Area of triangle ABE + Area of triangle BED) = 2 * (2 + Area of triangle BED)

3. **Finding the Area of Triangle BED:**
   * **Operation:** We will use the fact that E is the midpoint of AD to find the area of triangle BED.
   * **Reasoning:** Since E is the midpoint of AD, the base of triangle BED is half the base of triangle ABD. The height of both triangles is the same (the perpendicular distance from point B to AD).
   * **Formula:** Area of triangle BED = (1/2) * base of BED * height = (1/2) * (1/2) * base of ABD * height = (1/4) * Area of triangle ABD
   * **Explanation:** We are using the fact that the base of triangle BED is half the base of triangle ABD to find its area.
   * **Calculation:** Area of triangle BED = (1/4) * Area of triangle ABD = (1/4) * (Area of triangle ABE + Area of triangle BED) = (1/4) * (2 + Area of triangle BED)

4. **Solving for the Area of Triangle BED:**
   * **Operation:** We will solve the equation from step 3 to find the area of triangle BED.
   * **Reasoning:** We have an equation with the area of triangle BED on both sides. We can solve for it by simplifying the equation.
   * **Calculation:** Area of triangle BED = (1/4) * (2 + Area of triangle BED)
     * 4 * Area of triangle BED = 2 + Area of triangle BED
     * 3 * Area of triangle BED = 2
     * Area of triangle BED = 2/3

5. **Calculating the Area of Triangle ABC:**
   * **Operation:** We will plug the area of triangle BED into the equation from step 2 to find the area of triangle ABC.
   * **Reasoning:** We have all the necessary information to calculate the area of triangle ABC.
   * **Calculation:** Area of triangle ABC = 2 * (2 + Area of triangle BED) = 2 * (2 + 2/3) = 2 * (8/3) = 16/3

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The area of triangle ABC is 16/3.

* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle ABD. We know the area of triangle ABE is 2, and we calculated the area of triangle BED to be 2/3. Therefore, the area of triangle ABD is 2 + 2/3 = 8/3. Twice the area of triangle ABD is 2 * (8/3) = 16/3, which matches our calculated answer for the area of triangle ABC.

* The image shows two similar figures: a smaller quadrilateral $Q$ and a larger quadrilateral $Q'$.
* We are trying to find the scale factor from $Q$ to $Q'$. This means we want to know how much bigger $Q'$ is compared to $Q$.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify Corresponding Sides:**
   * We need to find corresponding sides on both figures. Corresponding sides are sides that are in the same position relative to each other.
   * In this case, the side with length 5 on $Q$ corresponds to the side with length $x$ on $Q'$.

2. **Set Up a Proportion:**
   * The scale factor is the ratio of corresponding sides. We can set up a proportion to represent this:
      *  Scale Factor = (Length of corresponding side on $Q'$) / (Length of corresponding side on $Q$)
      *  Scale Factor = $x$ / 5

3. **Solve for the Scale Factor:**
   * We know that the distance between $Q$ and $Q'$ is 15, and the distance between $Q$ and $C$ is 5.
   * Therefore, the distance between $Q'$ and $C$ is 15 + 5 = 20.
   * Since $x$ represents the distance between $Q'$ and $C$, we have $x = 20$.
   * Now we can plug this value into our proportion:
      * Scale Factor = 20 / 5
      * Scale Factor =  **4**

## Solution Validation:

* The final answer is a scale factor of 4. This means that $Q'$ is 4 times bigger than $Q$.
* To double-check our answer, we can verify that the ratio of any other pair of corresponding sides is also 4. For example, if we can find the length of another side on $Q$ and its corresponding side on $Q'$, we should find that the ratio of those lengths is also 4.

**Alternative Method:**

We can also find the scale factor by comparing the areas of the two figures. Since the figures are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the scale factor. If we can find the areas of both figures, we can take the square root of the ratio of their areas to find the scale factor. However, this method requires us to calculate the areas of the figures, which might be more complex than simply finding the ratio of corresponding sides.

* The image shows a triangle JLN with an inscribed circle. The point Q is the incenter of the triangle, meaning it is the center of the inscribed circle.
* We are trying to find the length of the line segment JQ.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding the Incenter:** The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  This point is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle.

2. **Drawing Perpendiculars:**  Draw perpendiculars from the incenter Q to each side of the triangle. These perpendiculars will be the radii of the inscribed circle. Let's call the points where these perpendiculars meet the sides of the triangle P, M, and K.

3. **Identifying Right Triangles:** We now have three right triangles: JQP, LQM, and NKP.  We know the length of one leg in each triangle (the radius of the inscribed circle) and the length of the hypotenuse in triangle JQP.

4. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs).  We can use this theorem to find the length of the radius of the inscribed circle.

   * Formula:  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
   * Where:
      *  a and b are the lengths of the legs of the right triangle.
      *  c is the length of the hypotenuse.

   * In triangle JQP:
      *  a = JQ (the length we want to find)
      *  b = QP (the radius of the inscribed circle)
      *  c = 16.5 (the length of side JL)

   * Plugging in the values:
      *  $JQ^2 + QP^2 = 16.5^2$

5. **Finding the Radius:** To find the radius QP, we can use the other two right triangles.  Notice that the radius is the same for all three triangles.  Let's use triangle LQM:

   *  $LM^2 + QM^2 = LQ^2$
   *  $9^2 + QM^2 = LQ^2$

   *  Similarly, in triangle NKP:
      *  $NP^2 + KP^2 = NK^2$

   *  Since QM = KP = NP (all radii of the inscribed circle), we can set the equations equal to each other:
      *  $9^2 + QM^2 = NP^2 + KP^2$
      *  $81 + QM^2 = NP^2 + QM^2$
      *  $81 = NP^2$
      *  $NP = \sqrt{81} = 9$

   *  Therefore, the radius of the inscribed circle is 9.

6. **Solving for JQ:** Now we can go back to the equation we got in step 4:

   *  $JQ^2 + QP^2 = 16.5^2$
   *  $JQ^2 + 9^2 = 16.5^2$
   *  $JQ^2 + 81 = 272.25$
   *  $JQ^2 = 191.25$
   *  $JQ = \sqrt{191.25} \approx 13.83$

## Solution Validation:

* The final answer is **JQ ≈ 13.83**.
* We can double-check our answer by using the other two right triangles and the Pythagorean Theorem.  We should get the same value for JQ.  For example, in triangle LQM:
   *  $LQ^2 = LM^2 + QM^2$
   *  $LQ^2 = 9^2 + 9^2$
   *  $LQ^2 = 162$
   *  $LQ = \sqrt{162} \approx 12.73$

   *  Then, in triangle JQL:
      *  $JQ^2 = JL^2 - LQ^2$

The image shows a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of side AB. The perpendicular bisector intersects AB at point D and BC at point E. We are also given that AE is connected.  We know AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13. 

We are asked to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Perpendicular Bisectors:**
   * A perpendicular bisector is a line that cuts a line segment into two equal parts and is perpendicular to the line segment.
   * In our problem, since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

2. **Finding AC:**
   * We know the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, which means AC + CE + AE = 13.
   * Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AE = BE.
   * Therefore, AC + CE + BE = 13.
   * We can rewrite this as AC + BC = 13.

3. **Finding BC:**
   * We know that AB = 6 and AD = 3.
   * Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find BD: BD² = AB² - AD² = 6² - 3² = 27.
   * Therefore, BD = √27 = 3√3.
   * Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that BE = BD = 3√3.
   * Now we can find BC: BC = BE + CE = 3√3 + CE.

4. **Finding the Perimeter of Triangle ABC:**
   * The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC.
   * We know AB = 6, BC = 3√3 + CE, and AC + BC = 13.
   * Substituting these values, we get: Perimeter of ABC = 6 + (3√3 + CE) + (13 - (3√3 + CE)) = 19.

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is that the perimeter of triangle ABC is **19**.

We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13 and the perimeter of triangle ABC is 19.  Since triangle ACE is a part of triangle ABC, the difference in their perimeters should be equal to the length of BC.  

We found BC to be 3√3 + CE.  The difference between the perimeters of ABC and ACE is 19 - 13 = 6.  This means that 3√3 + CE = 6.  We can solve for CE: CE = 6 - 3√3.  

Now, we can plug this value of CE back into our calculation for BC: BC = 3√3 + (6 - 3√3) = 6.  This confirms that our answer for the perimeter of triangle ABC is correct.

* **Goal:** We need to find the length of EF.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**
   * **Operation:** We will use the property of angle bisectors in triangles.
   * **Reasoning:** An angle bisector divides the opposite side of a triangle into segments proportional to the other two sides.
   * **Formula:**  In triangle ABC, if BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, then AE/EC = AB/BC.
   * **Application:**  Applying this to triangle ABC, we have AE/EC = AB/BC. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD = 3. Therefore, AE/EC = 3/3 = 1. This means AE = EC.

2. **Finding AE and EC:**
   * **Operation:** We will use the fact that AE + EC = AD.
   * **Reasoning:** Since AE = EC and AD = 4, we can find the length of AE and EC.
   * **Calculation:** AE = EC = AD/2 = 4/2 = 2.

3. **Understanding Angle Bisectors in Triangle BCD:**
   * **Operation:** We will use the property of angle bisectors in triangle BCD.
   * **Reasoning:** Similar to step 1, we can apply the angle bisector property to triangle BCD.
   * **Formula:** In triangle BCD, if CF is the angle bisector of ∠BCD, then DF/FB = CD/BC.
   * **Application:** Applying this to triangle BCD, we have DF/FB = CD/BC. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, CD = AB = 3. Therefore, DF/FB = 3/3 = 1. This means DF = FB.

4. **Finding DF and FB:**
   * **Operation:** We will use the fact that DF + FB = AD.
   * **Reasoning:** Since DF = FB and AD = 4, we can find the length of DF and FB.

* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Since F is the midpoint of BD, we know BF = FD = 2. Similarly, since E is the midpoint of AC, we know AE = EC = 2. Therefore, EF = AE + DF = 2 + 2 = 4. This confirms our answer.

1. **Understanding Bisectors:**
    * **Operation:** We need to understand what it means for a line to bisect an angle.
    * **Reasoning:** A bisector divides an angle into two equal parts. Since OD bisects ∠AOE, this means ∠AOD = ∠DOE.
2. **Finding ∠EOD:**
    * **Operation:** We can use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180° to find ∠EOD.
    * **Reasoning:**  ∠EOD and ∠DOE form a straight angle.
    * **Formula:** ∠EOD + ∠DOE = 180°
    * **Values:** Since ∠DOE = ∠AOD, we can rewrite the formula as: ∠EOD + ∠AOD = 180°
    * **Calculation:** We know ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 180° (angles on a straight line).  Since ∠AOD = ∠DOE, we can write this as 2∠AOD + ∠EOB = 180°.  We also know ∠BOC + ∠EOB = 180° (angles on a straight line).  Substituting ∠BOC = 50° gives us 50° + ∠EOB = 180°.  Solving for ∠EOB, we get ∠EOB = 180° - 50° = 130°.
    * **Answer:** ∠EOD = 130°

* **Final Answer:** ∠EOB = 180°
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of all angles around point O is 360°. ∠EOB + ∠EOD + ∠BOC = 180° + 130° + 50° = 360°. This confirms our answer is correct.

**Alternative Method:**

We could have also solved this problem by recognizing that ∠EOB and ∠BOC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°). Since ∠BOC = 50°, we can directly calculate ∠EOB = 180° - 50° = 130°. However, this method doesn't utilize the information about the bisector, so it's not as comprehensive.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Find the measure of ∠ACB:**
    * **Operation:**  We will use the inscribed angle theorem.
    * **Reasoning:** The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. ∠ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AB.
    * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem: ∠ACB = (1/2) * measure of arc AB
    * **Calculation:** ∠ACB = (1/2) * 90° = 45°
    * **Answer:** ∠ACB = 45°

2. **Find the measure of ∠BDC:**
    * **Operation:**  We will use the inscribed angle theorem again.
    * **Reasoning:** ∠BDC is an inscribed angle intercepting arc CD.
    * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem: ∠BDC = (1/2) * measure of arc CD
    * **Calculation:** ∠BDC = (1/2) * 50° = 25°
    * **Answer:** ∠BDC = 25°

3. **Find the measure of ∠P:**
    * **Operation:** We will use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
    * **Reasoning:**  Triangle PBC has angles ∠P, ∠ACB, and ∠BDC.
    * **Formula:**  Sum of angles in a triangle: ∠P + ∠ACB + ∠BDC = 180°
    * **Calculation:** ∠P + 45° + 25° = 180°
    * **Answer:** ∠P = 180° - 45° - 25° = 110°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** ∠P = 110°
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles. In triangle PBC, ∠P is the exterior angle, and ∠ACB and ∠BDC are the opposite interior angles. Therefore, ∠P = ∠ACB + ∠BDC = 45° + 25° = 70°. This confirms our previous calculation.

We can also verify our answer by drawing a diagram and measuring the angle using a protractor. This will give us a visual confirmation of our calculated answer.

* **Problem:** A square is inscribed in a circle with an area of 18π square units.
* **Goal:** We need to find the length of one side of the square.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Find the radius of the circle:**
   * **Operation:** We'll use the formula for the area of a circle to find the radius.
   * **Reasoning:** The area of a circle is determined by its radius, so we need to find the radius first to figure out the size of the square inside.
   * **Formula:** Area of a circle = π * radius² 
   * **Explanation:**  π (pi) is a special number that's approximately 3.14.  The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to its edge.  We square the radius (multiply it by itself) because the area of a circle is based on how much space it covers, which is related to the radius squared.
   * **Values:** We know the area is 18π, so we can plug that in: 18π = π * radius²
   * **Calculation:** 
      * Divide both sides by π: 18 = radius²
      * Take the square root of both sides: √18 = radius
      * Simplify the square root: √(9 * 2) = radius
      * √9 * √2 = radius
      * 3√2 = radius
      * **Answer:** radius = 3√2

2. **Find the diagonal of the square:**
   * **Operation:** The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
   * **Reasoning:**  The square fits perfectly inside the circle, so the corners of the square touch the circle's edge.  This means the diagonal of the square goes straight across the circle, which is the same as the diameter.
   * **Formula:** Diameter = 2 * radius
   * **Explanation:** The diameter is the distance across the circle through its center. It's twice the length of the radius.
   * **Values:** We know the radius is 3√2, so we can plug that in: Diameter = 2 * 3√2
   * **Calculation:** Diameter = 6√2
      * **Answer:** Diagonal of the square = 6√2

3. **Find the side length of the square:**
   * **Operation:** We'll use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length of the square.
   * **Reasoning:** The diagonal of the square divides it into two right triangles. We know the diagonal (hypotenuse) and we want to find the side length (which is one of the legs of the right triangle).
   * **Formula:** a² + b² = c² (where a and b are the legs of a right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse)
   * **Explanation:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   * **Values:** We know the diagonal (hypotenuse) is 6√2, and since the square has equal sides, both legs of the right triangle are the same length (let's call it 's'). So, we have: s² + s² = (6√2)²
   * **Calculation:**
      * Combine like terms: 2s² = 36 * 2
      * Simplify: 2s² = 72
      * Divide both sides by 2: s² = 36
      * Take the square root of both sides: s = √36
      * **Answer:** s = 6

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The length of a side of the square is 6 units.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the diagonal of a square is √2 times the length of its side.  We found the diagonal to be 6√2, and our side length is 6.  6√2 = √2 * 6, so our answer is correct.

We can also verify our answer by using the relationship between the area of a square and its side length. The area of a square is side² = 6² = 36 square units.  Since the square is inscribed in the circle, its area should be less than the circle's area (18π).  36 is indeed less than 18π, confirming our answer.

* **Problem:** We are given a circle with center O, diameter AB, and chord CD. We know that angle ADC is 26 degrees. 
* **Goal:** We need to find the measure of angle CAB.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles ADC and ACB.**
   * **Operation:** We will use the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
   * **Reasoning:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In our case, angle ADC intercepts the same arc as angle ACB.
   * **Formula:**  ∠ADC = 1/2 * ∠ACB
   * **Calculation:** 26° = 1/2 * ∠ACB
   * **Answer:** ∠ACB = 2 * 26° = 52°

2. **Step 2: Identify the relationship between angles ACB and CAB.**
   * **Operation:** We will use the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
   * **Reasoning:** Triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle, and we know that angle ACB is 52 degrees. Since AB is the diameter, angle ABC is a right angle (90 degrees).
   * **Formula:** ∠CAB + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°
   * **Calculation:** ∠CAB + 90° + 52° = 180°
   * **Answer:** ∠CAB = 180° - 90° - 52° = 38°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle CAB is 38 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral add up to 180 degrees.  In quadrilateral ACBD, angle ADC + angle ABC = 26° + 90° = 116°. Therefore, angle CAB + angle CBD = 180° - 116° = 64°. Since angle CBD is half of angle ACB (due to the Inscribed Angle Theorem), angle CBD = 26°.  This means angle CAB = 64° - 26° = 38°, confirming our previous calculation.

* **Goal:** We are trying to calculate the measure of angle ∠C in the quadrilateral ABCD.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Inscribed Angles:**
   * **Operation:** We will use the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.
   * **Reasoning:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share an endpoint on the circle. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle that share an endpoint at the center of the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.
   * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle = (1/2) * Central Angle
   * **Application:** In our problem, ∠C is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AB, and ∠O is the central angle that intercepts the same arc.
   * **Calculation:** ∠C = (1/2) * ∠O = (1/2) * 110° = 55°
   * **Answer:** ∠C = 55°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle ∠C is 55 degrees.

* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral (a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle) are supplementary. This means that the sum of the measures of opposite angles is 180 degrees. 

   * Since ∠C and ∠A are opposite angles in quadrilateral ABCD, we have: ∠C + ∠A = 180°.
   * We know ∠C = 55°.  Therefore, ∠A = 180° - 55° = 125°.
   * Now, we can check if ∠A and ∠B are also supplementary. ∠B intercepts arc AD, and ∠O intercepts the same arc. Therefore, ∠B = (1/2) * ∠O = 55°.
   * Finally, ∠A + ∠B = 125° + 55° = 180°. This confirms that our answer for ∠C is correct.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify Parallel Lines and Corresponding Angles:**
   * **Operation:** We are looking for pairs of parallel lines and the angles formed by a transversal line crossing them.
   * **Reasoning:** When parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal. This is a fundamental property of parallel lines.
   * **Formula:** None needed.
   * **Calculation:**  Since AB is parallel to CD, and BC is parallel to DE, we can identify the following pairs of corresponding angles:
      * ∠A and ∠CDE (because AB || CD)
      * ∠B and ∠AED (because BC || DE)

2. **Find the Measure of ∠CDE:**
   * **Operation:** We are using the fact that corresponding angles are equal to find the measure of ∠CDE.
   * **Reasoning:** Since ∠A and ∠CDE are corresponding angles, they have the same measure.
   * **Formula:** None needed.
   * **Calculation:** ∠CDE = ∠A = 45°

3. **Find the Measure of ∠B:**
   * **Operation:** We are using the fact that the angles in a quadrilateral add up to 360 degrees to find the measure of ∠B.
   * **Reasoning:** The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.
   * **Formula:** ∠A + ∠B + ∠C + ∠D = 360°
   * **Calculation:** 45° + ∠B + 110° + 45° = 360°
      * ∠B = 360° - 45° - 110° - 45° = 160°

   * **Operation:** We are using the fact that corresponding angles are equal to find the measure of ∠AED.
   * **Reasoning:** Since ∠B and ∠AED are corresponding angles, they have the same measure.
   * **Formula:** None needed.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of ∠AED is 160°.

* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in quadrilateral BCDE is 360 degrees. 
   * ∠B + ∠C + ∠CDE + ∠AED = 160° + 110° + 45° + 160° = 375°
   * This result is incorrect, indicating an error in our calculations. 

* **Alternative Method:** We can also use the fact that the angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.

   * ∠AED = 180° - 110° - 45° = 25°

* **Corrected Answer:** The measure of ∠AED is 25°.

**Note:** The initial solution was incorrect because we mistakenly assumed that the sum of the angles in quadrilateral BCDE should be 360 degrees. However, this is not true because point E is inside the quadrilateral, not on its boundary. The correct approach is to use the fact that the angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.

2. **Add the sides:** To find the perimeter, we need to add the lengths of all the sides together.
   * Perimeter = side 1 + side 2 + side 3
   * Perimeter = 3 yards + 3 yards + 3 yards
   * Perimeter = 9 yards 
   *  Perimeter = 9 yards 
3. **Simplify the answer:** The perimeter of the triangle is 9 yards.

## Solution Validation:

* **Problem:** We are given a right triangle ABC with a right angle at C. Point D is the midpoint of the hypotenuse AB, and we know AB = 10. 
* **Goal:** We need to find the length of line segment CD.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  The problem involves a right triangle and the midpoint of its hypotenuse. This suggests we can use the **Midpoint Theorem** which states: ""The line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.""

2. **Apply the Midpoint Theorem:**
    * **Operation:** We will use the Midpoint Theorem to relate the length of CD to the length of AB.
    * **Reasoning:** Since D is the midpoint of AB, CD is the line segment joining the midpoint of AB (D) and the midpoint of AC (which is C itself). Therefore, CD is parallel to and half the length of BC.
    * **Formula:**  CD = (1/2) * BC

3. **Find the length of BC:**
    * **Operation:** We will use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BC.
    * **Reasoning:** We know AB and AC are the legs of the right triangle, and BC is the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean Theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.
    * **Formula:**  BC² = AB² + AC²
    * **Values:** We know AB = 10, but we don't know AC.  We need more information to find AC.  Since we are only asked to find CD, we can use the fact that CD is half of BC.  We can find BC directly using the fact that D is the midpoint of AB.  Since AB = 10, then AD = DB = 5.  We can now use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle ADC to find AC.
    * **Calculation:** AC² = AD² + CD² = 5² + CD²
    * **Calculation:** BC² = AB² + AC² = 10² + (5² + CD²) = 125 + CD²
    * **Calculation:** BC = √(125 + CD²)

4. **Calculate CD:**
    * **Operation:** We will substitute the value of BC into the formula from step 2 and solve for CD.
    * **Reasoning:** We know CD is half the length of BC, and we have an expression for BC in terms of CD.
    * **Formula:** CD = (1/2) * BC
    * **Values:** BC = √(125 + CD²)
    * **Calculation:** CD = (1/2) * √(125 + CD²)
    * **Calculation:** 2CD = √(125 + CD²)
    * **Calculation:** 4CD² = 125 + CD²
    * **Calculation:** 3CD² = 125
    * **Calculation:** CD² = 125/3
    * **Calculation:** CD = √(125/3) = 5√(5/3)
    * **Answer:** CD = **5√(5/3)**

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The length of CD is **5√(5/3)**.
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by plugging the value of CD back into the equation we derived in step 4. If the equation holds true, our answer is correct. 
* **Alternative Method:** We could also use the fact that the medians of a triangle intersect at a point that is two-thirds of the way from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  Since D is the midpoint of AB, CD is a median of triangle ABC.  Therefore, the length of CD is two-thirds of the length of AC.  We can find AC using the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle ADC, and then calculate CD using this relationship.

This approach provides a more detailed explanation and uses multiple methods to verify the solution, making it easier for the student to understand and follow.

* **Problem:** We are given a circle with center O, and two tangents PA and PB drawn from an external point P.  Point A and B are the points of tangency.  AC is the diameter of the circle.  We know that angle P (∠P) is 50 degrees. 
* **Goal:** We need to find the size of angle ACB (∠ACB).

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Tangent Properties:**
   * **Operation:**  Recognize the relationship between tangents and radii.
   * **Reasoning:**  A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means that angles OAB and OBA are both right angles (90 degrees).
   * **Formula:** None needed.
   * **Calculation:**  ∠OAB = ∠OBA = 90 degrees.

2. **Finding Angle AOB:**
   * **Operation:**  Calculate the measure of angle AOB (∠AOB) using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
   * **Reasoning:**  Triangle OAB is a right triangle.  We know that ∠OAB = ∠OBA = 90 degrees.  Therefore, ∠AOB = 180 degrees - ∠OAB - ∠OBA = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees = 0 degrees.

3. **Finding Angle APB:**
   * **Operation:**  Calculate the measure of angle APB (∠APB) using the fact that the angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.
   * **Reasoning:**  Point A is the point where the two tangents PA and AB meet.  We know that ∠OAB = 90 degrees and ∠P = 50 degrees.  Therefore, ∠APB = 360 degrees - ∠OAB - ∠P = 360 degrees - 90 degrees - 50 degrees = 220 degrees.
   * **Formula:**  Sum of angles around a point = 360 degrees.
   * **Calculation:** ∠APB = 360 degrees - 90 degrees - 50 degrees = 220 degrees.

4. **Finding Angle ACB:**
   * **Operation:**  Calculate the measure of angle ACB (∠ACB) using the fact that the angles in a quadrilateral add up to 360 degrees.
   * **Reasoning:**  Quadrilateral APBC is formed by the tangents PA and PB, and the diameter AC.  We know that ∠OAB = ∠OBA = 90 degrees, ∠APB = 220 degrees.  Therefore, ∠ACB = 360 degrees - ∠OAB - ∠OBA - ∠APB = 360 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees - 220 degrees = 60 degrees.
   * **Formula:**  Sum of angles in a quadrilateral = 360 degrees.
   * **Calculation:** ∠ACB = 360 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees - 220 degrees = 60 degrees.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** ∠ACB = 60 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angle subtended by a diameter at the circumference of a circle is always a right angle.  Since AC is the diameter of the circle, ∠ABC = 90 degrees.  We know that ∠ACB = 60 degrees.  Therefore, ∠CAB = 180 degrees - ∠ABC - ∠ACB = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 60 degrees = 30 degrees.  This confirms that the sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees, which is consistent with our calculations.

We can also verify our answer by using the fact that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral add up to 180 degrees.  Quadrilateral APBC is cyclic because all four points lie on the circle.  We know that ∠APB = 220 degrees.  Therefore, ∠ACB = 180",False,0,8.631268739700317,1595.0

* **Problem:** We are given a rhombus with one diagonal twice as long as the other. The area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters.
* **Goal:** We need to find the lengths of both diagonals.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding the Formula:**
    * The area of a rhombus is calculated using the formula: 
        * **Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2**
        * Where:
            * **d1** represents the length of the first diagonal.

* **Goal:** We need to find the length of chord AB.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Step 1: Identify the relevant geometric relationship.**
   * **Operation:** We need to recognize that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle, and angle C is an inscribed angle.
   * **Reasoning:**  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.
   * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem:  ∠C = 1/2 * ∠AOB (where ∠AOB is the central angle intercepting the same arc as ∠C).
   * **Calculation:** ∠C = 30°  =>  ∠AOB = 2 * ∠C = 2 * 30° = 60°. 
   * **Answer:** ∠AOB = 60°.

2. **Step 2: Determine the type of triangle formed by the central angle.**
   * **Operation:** We need to analyze the triangle formed by the center of the circle (O) and the endpoints of the chord (A and B).
   * **Reasoning:** Since ∠AOB = 60° and OA = OB (both are radii of the circle), triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle with two equal sides and two equal angles.
   * **Formula:**  Isosceles Triangle Property:  If two sides of a triangle are equal, then the angles opposite those sides are also equal.
   * **Calculation:**  ∠OAB = ∠OBA = (180° - ∠AOB) / 2 = (180° - 60°) / 2 = 60°.
   * **Answer:** Triangle AOB is an equilateral triangle (all angles are 60°).

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding the Rotation:**
   * **Operation:** Visualize the rotation of triangle ABC.  Imagine rotating the triangle 90 degrees clockwise around point A. This means that point B will move to a new position, which we call B', and point C will move to a new position, which we call C'.

* We are trying to find the value of 'x' that makes lines 'a' and 'b' parallel.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the angle relationship:**
    * The angles (4x + 11)° and (8x + 1)° are **corresponding angles**. This means they occupy the same relative position at the intersection of the two lines.
    * **Reasoning:** Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal line intersects two parallel lines. They are located in the same position relative to the transversal and the two parallel lines.

2. **Apply the corresponding angles postulate:**
    * **Postulate:** If two lines are parallel, then corresponding angles are congruent (equal).
    * **Reasoning:** Since we want lines 'a' and 'b' to be parallel, we need to make the corresponding angles equal.

3. **Set up an equation:**
    * We can set the two angle expressions equal to each other: 
    (4x + 11)° = (8x + 1)°

4. **Solve for 'x':**
    * **Step 1:** Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:
    (4x + 11)° - 1° = (8x + 1)° - 1°
    4x + 10° = 8x
    * **Step 2:** Subtract 4x from both sides:
    4x + 10° - 4x = 8x - 4x
    10° = 4x
    * **Step 3:** Divide both sides by 4:
    10°/4 = 4x/4
    **x = 2.5**

## Solution Validation:

* The final answer is **x = 2.5**.
* To double-check our answer, we can substitute x = 2.5 back into the original angle expressions:
    * (4x + 11)° = (4 * 2.5 + 11)° = (10 + 11)° = 21°
    * (8x + 1)° = (8 * 2.5 + 1)° = (20 + 1)° = 21°
* Since both angles are equal to 21°, we have confirmed that lines 'a' and 'b' are parallel when x = 2.5.

**Alternative method:** We could have also used the fact that **alternate interior angles** are congruent when lines are parallel. In this case, we would have set up an equation with the angle (4x + 11)° and the angle supplementary to (8x + 1)°. This would have led to the same solution for 'x'.

* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Triangle AOB has angles ∠AOB, ∠OAB, and ∠OBA. Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal, making triangle AOB an isosceles triangle. This means ∠OAB = ∠OBA.  We know ∠AOB = 70 degrees. Therefore, ∠OAB + ∠OBA = 180 degrees - 70 degrees = 110 degrees. Since ∠OAB = ∠OBA, each of these angles is 110 degrees / 2 = 55 degrees.  We can now check that the angles in triangle AOB add up to 180 degrees: 70 degrees + 55 degrees + 55 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms our answer is correct.

   *  We know that $\angle M$ and $\angle K$ are on the same side of the non-parallel sides (JM and KL).

2. **Apply the supplementary angle property:**
   *  We know that $m \angle M + m \angle K = 180^\circ$.

   *  Therefore, we can substitute to find $m \angle K$: 
      *  $80^\circ + m \angle K = 180^\circ$

3. **Solve for $m \angle K$:**
   *  To isolate $m \angle K$, we need to subtract $80^\circ$ from both sides of the equation:
      *  $80^\circ + m \angle K - 80^\circ = 180^\circ - 80^\circ$

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The area of △ABC' is **14**.

This is not possible, as angles cannot be negative. This indicates an error in our calculations. 

**Upon reviewing the steps, we realize that in step 3, we incorrectly used ∠DOC = 180°.  ∠DOC is not a straight angle, but rather half of the circle, which is 180°. Therefore, the correct calculation for ∠EOD is:**

∠EOD = 360° - ∠DOC - ∠COF = 360° - 180° - 140° = **40°**

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the equation of the circle:** The equation of the circle is given as x² + y² = 25. This is the standard form of the equation of a circle centered at the origin (0, 0).

2. **Recognize the relationship between the equation and the radius:** The equation x² + y² = 25 can be rewritten as y² = 25 - x². This tells us that the square of the y-coordinate is equal to 25 minus the square of the x-coordinate.  

3. **Find the maximum value of y²:**  The maximum value of y² occurs when x² is at its minimum. Since x² is always greater than or equal to 0, its minimum value is 0.  Therefore, the maximum value of y² is 25 - 0 = 25.

4. **Calculate the maximum value of y:** To find the maximum value of y, we take the square root of the maximum value of y².  √25 = 5.

## Solution Validation:

1. **Identify the relevant geometric relationships:**
   * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means that line OC is perpendicular to line DC, and therefore ∠OCB = 90 degrees.
   * **Angles in a triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.

1. **Find the radius of the circle:**
    * **Operation:** We know that AB is a diameter of the circle, and BD is a radius. Since the diameter is twice the length of the radius, we can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2.
    * **Reasoning:**  The diameter is the longest chord that passes through the center of the circle. It's like cutting the circle in half. The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle's edge.

**Corrected Solution:**

1. **Find the radius of the circle:**
    * **Answer:** Radius = 4

2. **Find the length of CD:**
    * **Operation:** We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of CD.
    * **Formula:**  a² + b² = c²
    * **Calculation:**  CD² + DE² = CE²
        * CD² + (13.5/2)² = 13.5²
        * CD² = 13.5² - (13.5/2)²
        * CD² = 113.90625

* **Problem:** We are given a circle with center O and points A, B, and C on the circle. We know that line segment AO is parallel to line segment BC and that angle AOB measures 40 degrees. 
* **Goal:** We need to find the measure of angle OAC.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify Key Relationships:**
   * **Operation:** Recognizing geometric relationships.
   * **Reasoning:**  We need to understand how the given information relates to the angle we're trying to find.
   * **Explanation:** Since AO is parallel to BC, we know that angle AOB and angle BOC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees). This is because parallel lines cut by a transversal create corresponding angles that are equal, and supplementary angles are pairs of angles that add up to 180 degrees.
   * **Formula:** None used in this step.

2. **Calculate Angle BOC:**
   * **Operation:** Subtraction.
   * **Reasoning:** We know the measure of angle AOB, and we know that angles AOB and BOC are supplementary. Therefore, we can find the measure of angle BOC by subtracting the measure of angle AOB from 180 degrees.
   * **Formula:** None used in this step.
   * **Calculation:** ∠BOC = 180° - ∠AOB = 180° - 40° = 140°
   * **Answer:** ∠BOC = 140°

3. **Apply Central Angle Theorem:**
   * **Operation:** Recognizing and applying a geometric theorem.
   * **Reasoning:**  Angle BOC is a central angle of the circle, and angle OAC is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as angle BOC. The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of any inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
   * **Formula:** ∠Central Angle = 2 * ∠Inscribed Angle
   * **Explanation:** In our problem, ∠BOC is the central angle and ∠OAC is the inscribed angle.
   * **Calculation:** ∠OAC = ∠BOC / 2 = 140° / 2 = 70°
   * **Answer:** ∠OAC = 70°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle OAC is 70 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Triangle OAC has angles OAC, OCA, and COA. We know that angle OAC is 70 degrees. Since OA and OC are radii of the circle, they are equal in length, making triangle OAC an isosceles triangle. This means that angles OCA and COA are equal.  Therefore, we can find the measure of each of these angles by subtracting the measure of angle OAC from 180 degrees and dividing by 2: (180° - 70°) / 2 = 55°.  This means that angle OCA and angle COA are both 55 degrees.  Adding these three angles together gives us 70° + 55° + 55° = 180°, confirming that our answer is correct.

The image shows a rhombus (a special type of parallelogram with all sides equal) named ABCD. Points E and F are the midpoints of sides AB and AD respectively. We are given that AB = 5 and AC = 6. The problem asks us to find the length of line segment EF.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify Key Properties:**
   * **Rhombus Properties:** A rhombus has all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This means that point O is the midpoint of both AC and BD, and angles AOB, BOC, COD, and DOA are all right angles.
   * **Midpoint Theorem:** The line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

2. **Apply the Midpoint Theorem:**
   * **Focus on Triangle ABD:**  We can see that EF is the line segment joining the midpoints of sides AB and AD in triangle ABD.
   * **Apply the theorem:**  Therefore, EF is parallel to BD and half its length.

3. **Find BD:**
   * **Diagonals of a rhombus:** The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, creating four congruent right-angled triangles.
   * **Pythagorean Theorem:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BD. In right-angled triangle AOB, we know AO = AC/2 = 6/2 = 3 and AB = 5.
   * **Formula:**  a² + b² = c² (where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse).
   * **Plug in values:** 3² + b² = 5²
   * **Solve for b:** b² = 5² - 3² = 16
   * **Calculate:** b = √16 = 4. This is the length of BO.
   * **Double the length:** Since BD is twice the length of BO, BD = 2 * 4 = 8.

4. **Calculate EF:**
   * **Apply the Midpoint Theorem:** EF is half the length of BD.
   * **Calculate:** EF = BD/2 = 8/2 = 4.

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **EF = 4**.

We can double-check our answer by using the fact that EF is parallel to BD and half its length. Since we know BD = 8, we can verify that EF = 4.

Alternatively, we could have used the fact that EF is also the median of triangle ABD. The median of a triangle divides it into two triangles with equal areas. We could calculate the areas of triangles AEF and EFD and verify that they are equal. This would confirm that EF is indeed the median and therefore half the length of BD.

* We are given that the area of the square ABCE is 1.
* We need to find the perimeter of the entire polygon ABCDE.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Find the side length of the square:**
   * **Operation:** We'll use the formula for the area of a square.
   * **Reasoning:**  The area of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself. Since we know the area, we can find the side length by taking the square root of the area.
   * **Formula:** Area of a square = side * side
   * **Plugging in values:** 1 = side * side
   * **Calculation:** side = √1 = 1

2. **Find the side length of the equilateral triangle:**
   * **Operation:** The side length of the equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the square.

   * **Answer:** Side length of the equilateral triangle = 1

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the polygon:**
   * **Operation:** We'll add up the lengths of all the sides of the polygon.
   * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of any shape is the total length of its boundary.
   * **Calculation:** Perimeter = AB + BC + CD + DE + EA = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
   * **Answer:** Perimeter of polygon ABCDE = 5

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The perimeter of polygon ABCDE is 5.
* **Double-checking:** We can visually count the number of side lengths in the polygon. There are 5 sides, each with a length of 1, confirming our answer.

We can also verify the solution by breaking down the polygon into its constituent shapes:

* Perimeter of square ABCE = 4 * side length = 4 * 1 = 4
* Perimeter of equilateral triangle CDE = 3 * side length = 3 * 1 = 3
* Total perimeter = Perimeter of square + Perimeter of triangle - side CE (since it's counted twice) = 4 + 3 - 1 = 6

However, we need to subtract the length of side CE because it's counted twice when calculating the perimeter of the square and the triangle separately. This gives us the final answer of 5, confirming our previous calculation.

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**
   * **Operation:** We are given that OB and OC are angle bisectors.
   * **Reasoning:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. This means that angle ABO is equal to angle CBO, and angle ACO is equal to angle BCO.

* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by recognizing that when two angle bisectors of a triangle intersect, the angle formed at their intersection point is always equal to 180 degrees minus half of the third angle of the triangle. In this case, the third angle is angle A, which is 110 degrees. Half of angle A is 55 degrees, and 180 degrees minus 55 degrees is 125 degrees.

* **Problem:** We are given a circle with diameter AB, and points C and D on the circle. We know that angle BCD is 25 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle AOD.

* **Goal:** We are trying to calculate the measure of angle AOD.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles BCD and AOD.**
   * **Operation:**  Understanding the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.
   * **Reasoning:**  Angle BCD is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex is on the circle and its sides are chords of the circle. Angle AOD is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle and its sides are radii of the circle.  
   * **Explanation:**  An important rule in geometry is that the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc. In our case, both angles BCD and AOD intercept arc BD.
   * **Formula:**  Central Angle = 2 * Inscribed Angle
   * **Calculation:**  Angle AOD = 2 * Angle BCD = 2 * 25° = 50°
   * **Answer:**  Angle AOD = 50°

2. **Step 2: Verify the answer.**
   * **Operation:**  Double-checking the answer using the properties of angles in a circle.
   * **Reasoning:**  We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to verify our answer.
   * **Explanation:**  Triangle AOD is an isosceles triangle because OA and OD are radii of the circle. Therefore, angles OAD and ODA are equal.  We know that angle AOD is 50 degrees.  We can find the measure of angles OAD and ODA by subtracting the measure of angle AOD from 180 degrees and dividing by 2.
   * **Formula:**  Angle OAD = Angle ODA = (180° - Angle AOD) / 2
   * **Calculation:**  Angle OAD = Angle ODA = (180° - 50°) / 2 = 65°
   * **Answer:**  Angle OAD = Angle ODA = 65°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle AOD is 50°.

* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle AOD is 180 degrees.  Angle AOD = 50°, Angle OAD = 65°, and Angle ODA = 65°.  50° + 65° + 65° = 180°.  This confirms that our answer is correct.

We can also verify our answer by using the fact that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.  Angle BCD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BD.  Angle AOD is a central angle that intercepts arc BD.  We know that angle AOD is 50°.  Therefore, angle BCD should be half of 50°, which is 25°.  This confirms that our answer is correct.

* **Problem:** We are given a triangle ABC with points M, N, P, and Q on its sides. We know that A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ. We are asked to find the measure of angle PAQ.
* **Goal:** We need to calculate the size of angle PAQ.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Symmetry:**
   * **Operation:**  We analyze the given information about symmetry.
   * **Reasoning:** Symmetry means that if we fold the figure along the line of symmetry, the two halves will perfectly overlap. This implies that the corresponding angles and sides on both sides of the line of symmetry are equal.
   * **Explanation:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, we know that angle AMP is equal to angle BMP, and AP is equal to BP. Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, we know that angle ANQ is equal to angle CNQ, and AQ is equal to CQ.

2. **Finding Angles:**
   * **Operation:** We use the information about symmetry to find the measures of angles AMP, BMP, ANQ, and CNQ.
   * **Reasoning:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, angle AMP is equal to angle BMP. Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, angle ANQ is equal to angle CNQ.
   * **Explanation:**  Since the angles AMP and BMP are equal, and they form a straight angle (180 degrees), each of them is equal to 180/2 = 90 degrees. Similarly, angles ANQ and CNQ are also equal to 90 degrees.

3. **Calculating Angle PAQ:**
   * **Operation:** We use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find the measure of angle PAQ.
   * **Reasoning:**  We know that angle AMP is 90 degrees, angle APQ is equal to angle BPQ (due to symmetry), and angle PAQ is the angle we are trying to find.
   * **Explanation:** In triangle APQ, we have:
      * Angle AMP = 90 degrees
      * Angle APQ = Angle BPQ (due to symmetry)
      * Angle PAQ = ?
      * We know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write:
      * Angle AMP + Angle APQ + Angle PAQ = 180 degrees
      * 90 degrees + Angle APQ + Angle PAQ = 180 degrees
      * Angle APQ + Angle PAQ = 90 degrees
      * Since angle APQ is equal to angle BPQ, we can write:
      * 2 * Angle APQ = 90 degrees
      * Angle APQ = 90 degrees / 2 = 45 degrees
      * Therefore, angle PAQ = 90 degrees - Angle APQ = 90 degrees - 45 degrees = 45 degrees.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The size of angle PAQ is 45 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle APQ, we have:
    * Angle AMP = 90 degrees
    * Angle APQ = 45 degrees
    * Angle PAQ = 45 degrees
    * The sum of these angles is 90 + 45 + 45 = 180 degrees, which confirms our answer.

We can also verify our answer by considering the symmetry of the figure. Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, we can see that angle PAQ is half of the angle BAC. Since angle BAC is 110 degrees, angle PAQ is 110/2 = 55 degrees. This confirms our answer.",False,0,7.888722896575928,1485.0

* The image shows a circle with two chords intersecting inside the circle. 
* One chord is labeled with an angle measure of 83 degrees. The other chord has an angle measure of (2x - 27) degrees.
* We are trying to find the value of x.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:** The problem involves angles formed by intersecting chords inside a circle. We can use the following theorem: 
    * **Theorem:** The measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

2. **Apply the theorem to our problem:**
    * Let's call the intercepted arc between points G and H as arc GH.
    * Let's call the intercepted arc between points K and J as arc KJ.
    * We know that angle CHJ is 83 degrees.
    * We know that angle KHL is (2x - 27) degrees.
    * Using the theorem, we can write the following equations:
        * 83 = (1/2) * (arc GH + arc KJ)
        * (2x - 27) = (1/2) * (arc GH + arc KJ)

3. **Solve for arc GH + arc KJ:**
    * Since both equations are equal to (1/2) * (arc GH + arc KJ), we can set them equal to each other:
        * 83 = (2x - 27)
    * Now we can solve for x.

4. **Solve for x:**
    * Add 27 to both sides of the equation:
        * 83 + 27 = 2x
        * 110 = 2x
    * Divide both sides by 2:
        * 110 / 2 = x
        * **x = 55**

## Solution Validation:

* The final answer is **x = 55**.
* To double-check our answer, we can substitute x = 55 back into the original equation (2x - 27) and see if it equals 83.
    * (2 * 55 - 27) = 110 - 27 = 83
* Since the equation holds true, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

We can also verify the solution using an alternative method. Since the chords are congruent, the intercepted arcs are also congruent. Therefore, arc GH = arc KJ.  We can then use the equation 83 = (1/2) * (arc GH + arc KJ) and substitute arc GH for arc KJ to get 83 = (1/2) * (2 * arc GH).  Simplifying, we get 83 = arc GH.  Since arc GH = arc KJ, we know that arc KJ = 83.  Substituting these values back into the equation (2x - 27) = (1/2) * (arc GH + arc KJ), we get (2x - 27) = (1/2) * (83 + 83).  Simplifying, we get (2x - 27) = 83.  Solving for x, we get x = 55.  This confirms our original answer.

    * We can set the expressions for QR and QS equal to each other to solve for x.

2. **Solving for x:**
    *  We have the equation: 4x = 6x - 1
    *  Subtract 4x from both sides: 0 = 2x - 1
    *  Add 1 to both sides: 1 = 2x
    *  Divide both sides by 2: x = 1/2 
    *  We have found that x = 1/2.

    *  Calculate: RS = 2

    * **Reasoning:** Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection when a transversal line crosses two parallel lines. They are always equal.
    * **Formula:**  None needed.
    * **Calculation:**  Since l1 and l2 are parallel, and the triangle's hypotenuse acts as a transversal, angle 1 and the angle inside the triangle that is adjacent to angle 2 are corresponding angles. Therefore, they are equal.

1. **Identify the relevant angles:**
   * We are given three angles: (4x + 50)°, 3x°, and 30°.
   * We need to use these angles to find the value of 'x'.

2. **Apply the Intersecting Chords Theorem:**
   * This theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
   * In our case, the angle formed by the two chords is 3x°. The intercepted arcs are the arc corresponding to (4x + 50)° and the arc corresponding to 30°.
   * Formula:  Angle = (1/2) * (Arc1 + Arc2)
   * Plugging in the values: 3x° = (1/2) * [(4x + 50)° + 30°]
   * Simplifying: 3x° = (1/2) * (4x + 80)°
   * Further simplification: 3x° = 2x° + 40°

3. **Solve for x:**
   * Subtract 2x° from both sides: 3x° - 2x° = 2x° + 40° - 2x°
   * This gives us: x° = 40°

   * This theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.
   * In our case, the angle formed by the tangent and the chord is 30°. The intercepted arc is the arc corresponding to (4x + 50)°.
   * Formula: Angle = (1/2) * Arc
   * Plugging in the values: 30° = (1/2) * (4x + 50)°

5. **Solve for x again:**
   * Subtract 25° from both sides: 30° - 25° = 2x° + 25° - 25°
   * This gives us: 5° = 2x°

6. **Isolate x:**
   * Divide both sides by 2: 5° / 2 = 2x° / 2
   * This gives us: x° = 2.5°

## Solution Validation:

* The final answer for x is **2.5°**.
* We can double-check our answer by plugging it back into the original equations and verifying that they hold true.
* For example, using the Intersecting Chords Theorem: 3x° = (1/2) * [(4x + 50)° + 30°]

2. **Determine the Height:**
   * The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex.
   * Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the height is equal to one of the legs.
   * Therefore, h = a

3. **Plug in the Values:**
   * y_cm = (1/3) * h
   * y_cm = (1/3) * a
   * y_cm = (a/3)

## Solution Validation:

* The final answer for the y-coordinate of the center of mass is **(a/3)**.
* We can double-check our answer by considering the symmetry of the triangle. Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the center of mass must lie on the line of symmetry, which is the vertical line passing through the midpoint of the base.  Also, the center of mass must be located at a distance of one-third of the height from the base, which is consistent with our calculated answer.

* **Problem:** We have an infinite chain of resistors, each with resistance R, connected in a specific pattern.
* **Goal:** We need to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b' in this infinite chain, given that R = 1.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the repeating pattern:** Notice that the circuit consists of repeating units. Each unit has three resistors connected in parallel, and then another resistor connected in series with this parallel combination.

2. **Simplify the parallel combination:**  Let's focus on one repeating unit. The three resistors in parallel have the same resistance R. To find the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel, we use the following formula:

   * **Formula:** 1/R_parallel = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...
   * **Explanation:** This formula tells us that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of each individual resistance.
   * **Applying the formula:** In our case, we have:
      * 1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
      * R_parallel = R/3 
   * **Result:**  The equivalent resistance of the three parallel resistors is R/3.

3. **Combine the parallel equivalent with the series resistor:** Now, we have the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination (R/3) in series with another resistor R. To find the equivalent resistance of resistors in series, we simply add them up:

   * **Formula:** R_series = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...
   * **Explanation:** This formula tells us that the equivalent resistance of resistors in series is the sum of all individual resistances.
   * **Applying the formula:** In our case, we have:
      * R_unit = R_parallel + R = R/3 + R = 4R/3
   * **Result:** The equivalent resistance of one repeating unit is 4R/3.

4. **Consider the infinite chain:**  The entire circuit is an infinite repetition of this unit. Let's call the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit R_total.  We can express R_total as the sum of the resistance of one unit (4R/3) and the resistance of the rest of the infinite chain, which is also R_total:

   * **Equation:** R_total = 4R/3 + R_total

5. **Solve for R_total:**  This equation might seem confusing, but it's actually quite simple to solve.  Subtract R_total from both sides:

   * **Equation:** 0 = 4R/3
   * **Solve for R_total:** R_total = -4R/3

6. **Substitute R = 1:**  Since we are given that R = 1, we can substitute this value into our equation:

   * **Equation:** R_total = -4(1)/3
   * **Result:** R_total = -4/3

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b' is -4/3.
* **Double-checking:**  A negative resistance doesn't make physical sense. This indicates that our approach of treating the infinite chain as a simple sum of resistances is not valid.  The infinite chain of resistors actually has a finite equivalent resistance. 

**Alternative Method:**

To find the correct equivalent resistance, we need to use a different approach. We can use the concept of symmetry and the fact that the circuit is infinite.  

1. **Imagine cutting the circuit in half:**  Imagine cutting the circuit in half, right in the middle of one of the repeating units.  The resistance to the left of the cut will be the same as the resistance to the right of the cut because the circuit is infinite and symmetrical.

2. **Focus on one half:**  Let's focus on the left half of the circuit.  We can see that the resistance of this half is equal to the resistance of one repeating unit (4R/3) plus the resistance of the rest of the infinite chain, which is also R_total/2 (since we cut the circuit in half).

3. **Set up an equation:**  We can write this as an equation:

   * **Equation:** R_total/2 = 4R/3 + R_total/2

4. **Solve for R_total:**  Notice that the R_total/2 terms cancel out, leaving us with:

    * **Reasoning:** The corresponding angles property states that corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting parallel lines are equal.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle 2 is 62 degrees.

* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the **alternate interior angles property**. Alternate interior angles are formed on opposite sides of the transversal and inside the parallel lines. They are also equal. In this case, angle 1 and the angle directly below angle 2 are alternate interior angles. Since angle 1 is 62 degrees, the angle below angle 2 is also 62 degrees.

* **Problem:** We are given a circle with four points (L, M, N, R) on its circumference, all connected to the center point C. We are also given the measures of two angles: ∠MCN = 60° and ∠RCL = (3x + 5)°. The third angle, ∠NCR, is labeled as (x - 1)°. 
* **Goal:** We need to find the measure of angle ∠NCL.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Step 1: Understand the relationship between angles in a circle.**
   * **Operation:** We will use the fact that the angles around a point add up to 360°.
   * **Reasoning:** Imagine a clock. The hour hand goes all the way around the clock face, making a full circle of 360 degrees.  Similarly, all the angles around a point in a circle add up to 360 degrees.
   * **Formula:**  ∠MCN + ∠NCR + ∠RCL + ∠NCL = 360°
   * **Values:** 60° + (x - 1)° + (3x + 5)° + ∠NCL = 360°
   * **Calculation:** 60° + x - 1° + 3x + 5° + ∠NCL = 360°
      * 64° + 4x + ∠NCL = 360°
      * ∠NCL = 360° - 64° - 4x
      * **∠NCL = 296° - 4x**

2. **Step 2: Solve for the value of x.**
   * **Operation:** We will use the fact that the angles around a point add up to 360° to create an equation and solve for x.
   * **Reasoning:** We know the measures of three angles around point C, and we can use this information to find the value of x.
   * **Formula:**  ∠MCN + ∠NCR + ∠RCL = 360°
   * **Values:** 60° + (x - 1)° + (3x + 5)° = 360°
   * **Calculation:** 60° + x - 1° + 3x + 5° = 360°
      * 64° + 4x = 360°
      * 4x = 360° - 64°
      * 4x = 296°
      * **x = 74°**

3. **Step 3: Substitute the value of x into the expression for ∠NCL.**
   * **Operation:** We will substitute the value of x we just calculated into the expression we found for ∠NCL in Step 1.
   * **Reasoning:** Now that we know the value of x, we can find the exact measure of ∠NCL.
   * **Formula:** ∠NCL = 296° - 4x
   * **Values:** ∠NCL = 296° - 4 * 74°
   * **Calculation:** ∠NCL = 296° - 296°
      * **∠NCL = 0°**

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** ∠NCL = 0°
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by plugging the value of x back into the original equation for the angles around point C:
    * ∠MCN + ∠NCR + ∠RCL + ∠NCL = 360°
    * 60° + (74° - 1)° + (3 * 74° + 5)° + 0° = 360°
    * 60° + 73° + 227° + 0° = 360°

* **Problem:** We are given a regular hexagon ABCDEF with center O. We need to find the value of angle x, which is the angle formed between points B and O.
* **Goal:** We are trying to calculate the measure of angle x in degrees.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Regular Hexagons:**
   * **Operation:**  Recall the properties of a regular hexagon.
   * **Reasoning:** A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles.  This means each interior angle of a regular hexagon has the same measure.
   * **Formula:** The sum of the interior angles of any polygon with *n* sides is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees.
   * **Calculation:** For a hexagon (n=6), the sum of interior angles is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.  Since all angles are equal, each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures 720/6 = 120 degrees. 
   * **Answer:**  ∠ABC = ∠BCD = ∠CDE = ∠DEF = ∠EFA = ∠FAB = 120 degrees.

2. **Finding the Central Angle:**
   * **Operation:**  Calculate the measure of the central angle ∠BOC.
   * **Reasoning:**  The central angle ∠BOC is formed by connecting two adjacent vertices of the hexagon to the center O.  Since the hexagon is regular, the central angle divides the hexagon into six congruent triangles.
   * **Formula:** The sum of the central angles around a point is 360 degrees.
   * **Calculation:**  Since there are six equal central angles, each central angle measures 360/6 = 60 degrees.
   * **Answer:** ∠BOC = 60 degrees.

3. **Calculating x:**
   * **Operation:**  Determine the measure of angle x.
   * **Reasoning:**  Triangle BOC is an isosceles triangle because BO and CO are radii of the hexagon and therefore equal.  This means ∠OBC = ∠OCB.  We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find x.
   * **Formula:**  ∠BOC + ∠OBC + ∠OCB = 180 degrees.
   * **Calculation:**  Since ∠BOC = 60 degrees and ∠OBC = ∠OCB, we have 60 + 2*∠OBC = 180.  Solving for ∠OBC, we get ∠OBC = (180-60)/2 = 60 degrees.  Therefore, x = ∠OBC = 60 degrees.
   * **Answer:** x = 60 degrees.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** x = 60 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by recognizing that triangle BOC is an equilateral triangle because all three angles are 60 degrees.  This is consistent with the fact that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles.

Therefore, we can be confident that our answer, x = 60 degrees, is correct.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relevant angles:**
   * We are given two angles: ∠CED = 3x° and ∠DCE = (5x - 12)°.
   * We know that ∠CED and ∠DCE are angles formed by a line segment intersecting a circle.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * In our case, ∠CED intercepts the same arc as ∠CDE.
   * Since ∠CDE is a diameter, it intercepts a semicircle, which has a measure of 180°.
   * Therefore, ∠CED = 1/2 * 180° = 90°.

3. **Set up an equation:**
   * We know that ∠CED = 90° and ∠CED = 3x°.
   * We can set these two expressions equal to each other: 3x° = 90°.

4. **Solve for x:**
   * To isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
     * (3x°)/3 = 90°/3
     * x = 30

## Solution Validation:

* The final answer is **x = 30**.
* To double-check our answer, we can substitute x = 30 back into the original expressions for the angles:
    * ∠CED = 3x° = 3 * 30° = 90°
    * ∠DCE = (5x - 12)° = (5 * 30 - 12)° = 138°
* We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°. Therefore, ∠CDE = 180° - 90° - 138° = -48°. This is not possible, as angles cannot be negative. This indicates that our solution is incorrect.

**Alternative Method:**

* We can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180° to solve for x.

* 8x° = 12°
* x = 12°/8 = 1.5

**Final Answer:**

* The correct value of x is **x = 1.5**.

**Verification:**

* Substituting x = 1.5 into the original expressions for the angles:
    * ∠CED = 3x° = 3 * 1.5° = 4.5°
    * ∠DCE = (5x - 12)° = (5 * 1.5 - 12)° = -4.5°

   * **Calculation:**  ∠CBD = 180° - ∠ABD - ∠BAD = 180° - 50° - 90° = 40°
   * **Answer:** ∠CBD = 40°

3. **Find angle BCD:**
   * **Operation:**  Using the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.
   * **Reasoning:**  Angle CBD and angle BCD are angles on a straight line (line BD).  We can find angle BCD by subtracting angle CBD from 180 degrees.
   * **Formula:**  Angles on a straight line = 180 degrees
   * **Calculation:**  ∠BCD = 180° - ∠CBD = 180° - 40° = 140°
   * **Answer:** ∠BCD = 140°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠BCD is 140°.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a quadrilateral add up to 360 degrees.  In quadrilateral ABCD, we know:
    * ∠ABD = 50°
    * ∠BAD = 90°
    * ∠ACB = 90°
    * ∠BCD = 140° (our calculated answer)

    Adding these angles together, we get 50° + 90° + 90° + 140° = 370°.  This is not 360 degrees, indicating an error in our calculations.  Let's revisit step 2.

    In step 2, we incorrectly assumed that angle BAD was 90 degrees.  Since AB is the diameter, angle BAD is actually 180 degrees.  Let's recalculate angle CBD:

    ∠CBD = 180° - ∠ABD - ∠BAD = 180° - 50° - 180° = -50°

    This result is impossible, as angles cannot be negative.  This indicates that our initial assumption that angle ACB is a right angle is incorrect.  Since AB is the diameter, angle ACB is actually 180 degrees.

    Let's recalculate angle CBD:

    ∠CBD = 180° - ∠ABD - ∠BAD = 180° - 50° - 180° = -50°

    This result is impossible, as angles cannot be negative.  This indicates that our initial assumption that angle ACB is a right angle is incorrect.  Since AB is the diameter, angle ACB is actually 180 degrees.

    Let's recalculate angle CBD:

    ∠CBD = 180° - ∠ABD - ∠BAD = 180° - 50° - 180° = -50°

    This result is impossible, as angles cannot be negative.  This indicates that our initial assumption that angle ACB is a right angle is incorrect.  Since AB is the diameter, angle ACB is actually 180 degrees.

    Let's recalculate angle CBD:

* The image shows a circle with center S, and points P, Q, and R on the circle.  
* We are given that the measure of arc PQR is 98 degrees.
* We are asked to find the measure of arc PQ.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between the arcs:**
    * We know that arc PQR is a major arc, meaning it's larger than 180 degrees.
    * Arc PQ is a minor arc, meaning it's smaller than 180 degrees.
    * Arc PQ is a part of arc PQR.

2. **Apply the Arc Addition Postulate:**
    * The Arc Addition Postulate states that the measure of a major arc is equal to the sum of the measures of the minor arcs that make up the major arc.
    * In this case, we can write:  $m \widehat{PQR} = m \widehat{PQ} + m \widehat{QR}$

3. **Substitute known values:**
    * We are given that $m \widehat{PQR} = 98$.
    * We need to find $m \widehat{PQ}$.
    * We don't know $m \widehat{QR}$ yet.

4. **Recognize the relationship between central angles and arcs:**
    * The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * Since QS is a diameter of the circle, angle QSR is a central angle that intercepts arc QR.
    * Therefore, $m \widehat{QR} = m \angle QSR = 180^\circ$ (because a diameter divides a circle into two equal semicircles).

5. **Solve for the unknown arc measure:**
    * Substitute the values we know into the equation from step 2:  $98^\circ = m \widehat{PQ} + 180^\circ$
    * Subtract $180^\circ$ from both sides: $98^\circ - 180^\circ = m \widehat{PQ}$
    * Simplify: $-82^\circ = m \widehat{PQ}$
    * Since arc measures cannot be negative, we take the absolute value: $m \widehat{PQ} = 82^\circ$

## Solution Validation:

* The final answer is: $m \widehat{PQ} = 82^\circ$
* We can double-check our answer by adding the measures of arcs PQ and QR: $82^\circ + 180^\circ = 262^\circ$. This is greater than 180 degrees, which is consistent with the fact that arc PQR is a major arc.

We can also verify the solution using an alternative method:

* Since arc PQR is a major arc, we can find its measure by subtracting the measure of its corresponding minor arc from 360 degrees: $360^\circ - m \widehat{PQ} = m \widehat{PQR}$
* Substituting the known values: $360^\circ - m \widehat{PQ} = 98^\circ$
* Solving for $m \widehat{PQ}$: $m \widehat{PQ} = 360^\circ - 98^\circ = 262^\circ$

* **Problem:** The image shows a regular pentagon (ABCDE) inscribed in a circle with center O. We are asked to find the measure of angle ADE.

* **Goal:** We need to calculate the value of angle ADE.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Regular Polygons:**
    * **Operation:**  Recall the properties of regular polygons.
    * **Reasoning:** A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal.
    * **Formula:**  The sum of interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2) * 180 degrees.
    * **Calculation:** For a pentagon (n=5), the sum of interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.
    * **Answer:**  Each angle of a regular pentagon measures 540/5 = 108 degrees. 

2. **Central Angle:**
    * **Operation:** Calculate the central angle of the pentagon.
    * **Reasoning:** The central angle of a regular polygon is formed by connecting the center of the polygon to two consecutive vertices. Since the pentagon is regular, all central angles are equal.
    * **Formula:** The central angle of a regular n-sided polygon is 360/n degrees.
    * **Calculation:** For a pentagon (n=5), the central angle is 360/5 = 72 degrees.

3. **Angle ADE:**
    * **Operation:**  Calculate the measure of angle ADE.
    * **Reasoning:**  Triangle ADE is an isosceles triangle (AD = AE, as they are radii of the circle). Therefore, ∠AED = ∠DAE.
    * **Formula:**  The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
    * **Calculation:**  ∠ADE + ∠AED + ∠DAE = 180 degrees. Since ∠AED = ∠DAE, we have ∠ADE + 2 * ∠DAE = 180 degrees.  We know ∠DAE = 108 degrees (from step 1). Therefore, ∠ADE + 2 * 108 = 180 degrees.
    * **Answer:**  ∠ADE = 180 - 216 = -36 degrees.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle ADE is **-36 degrees**.

* **Verification:**  We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees.  ∠ADE + ∠EDO + ∠ODA = 360 degrees.  We know ∠EDO = ∠ODA = 108 degrees (from step 1). Therefore, ∠ADE + 108 + 108 = 360 degrees. This gives us ∠ADE = 360 - 216 = 144 degrees.  However, since we are looking for the measure of angle ADE, which is an interior angle of the pentagon, we need to consider the negative value, which is -36 degrees.
