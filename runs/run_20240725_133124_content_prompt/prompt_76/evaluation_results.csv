643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem Deconstruction:

The image shows a circle with center O, diameter CD, and chords DE and OA. We are given that DE is parallel to OA and that angle D measures 50 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle C.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify Key Relationships:**
    * **Parallel Lines:** Since DE is parallel to OA, we know that alternate interior angles are equal. This means that angle D and angle A are equal.
    * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  An inscribed angle in a circle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Angle D intercepts arc CE, and angle C intercepts arc DE.

2. **Find the Measure of Angle A:**
    * **Operation:**  We use the fact that alternate interior angles are equal.
    * **Reasoning:** Since DE is parallel to OA, angle D and angle A are alternate interior angles and therefore have the same measure.
    * **Formula:**  None needed.
    * **Calculation:**  Angle A = Angle D = 50 degrees.
    * **Answer:**  ∠A = 50°

3. **Find the Measure of Arc CE:**
    * **Operation:** We use the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
    * **Reasoning:** Angle D is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CE. The Inscribed Angle Theorem tells us that the measure of angle D is half the measure of arc CE.
    * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem:  ∠D = (1/2) * arc CE
    * **Calculation:**  50° = (1/2) * arc CE
                      arc CE = 50° * 2 = 100°
    * **Answer:**  arc CE = 100°

4. **Find the Measure of Arc DE:**
    * **Operation:** We use the fact that the entire circle measures 360 degrees.
    * **Reasoning:** Since CD is the diameter, arc CD is a semicircle and measures 180 degrees.  We know arc CE measures 100 degrees, so the remaining part of the circle, arc DE, must measure 180 degrees - 100 degrees = 80 degrees.
    * **Formula:**  None needed.
    * **Calculation:**  arc DE = 360° - arc CD - arc CE = 360° - 180° - 100° = 80°
    * **Answer:**  arc DE = 80°

5. **Find the Measure of Angle C:**
    * **Operation:** We use the Inscribed Angle Theorem again.
    * **Reasoning:** Angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc DE. The Inscribed Angle Theorem tells us that the measure of angle C is half the measure of arc DE.
    * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem:  ∠C = (1/2) * arc DE
    * **Calculation:**  ∠C = (1/2) * 80° = 40°
    * **Answer:**  ∠C = 40°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The degree of angle C is 40 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Triangle COD has angles C, D, and O. We know angle D is 50 degrees.  Since CD is a diameter, angle O is a right angle (90 degrees).  Therefore, angle C must be 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 90 degrees = 40 degrees. This confirms our answer.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## Problem Deconstruction:

The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees, one side measuring 4 units, and the hypotenuse labeled as 'h'. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse, 'h'.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We have the length of the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle (4 units) and we want to find the hypotenuse. The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is **cosine**. 

    * **Formula:** cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse
    * **Explanation:** The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.
    * **Plugging in values:** cos(60°) = 4 / h

2. **Solve for 'h':** To isolate 'h', we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 'h' and then divide both sides by cos(60°).

    * **Multiplying both sides by 'h':** h * cos(60°) = 4
    * **Dividing both sides by cos(60°):** h = 4 / cos(60°)
    * **Calculating the result:** h = 4 / (1/2) = 8
    * **Answer:** h = 8

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **h = 8**.

We can double-check our answer using the **Pythagorean theorem**, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

* **Formula:** a² + b² = c²
* **Explanation:** 'a' and 'b' represent the lengths of the two shorter sides of the right triangle, and 'c' represents the length of the hypotenuse.
* **Plugging in values:** 4² + b² = 8²
* **Solving for 'b':** 16 + b² = 64
    * b² = 64 - 16
    * b² = 48
    * b = √48 = 4√3

Since we know the length of one of the shorter sides (4 units) and the hypotenuse (8 units), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other shorter side. The result (4√3) confirms that our initial calculation for 'h' is correct.

The image shows a circle with center O and an inscribed triangle ABC. We are given that angle ABC is 70 degrees and need to find the measure of angle AOC.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between the inscribed angle and the central angle:**
    * **Mathematical Operation:** Recognizing the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.
    * **Reasoning:**  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share an endpoint on the circle. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.  The central angle subtends the same arc as the inscribed angle.
    * **Explanation:** In our problem, angle ABC is an inscribed angle, and angle AOC is a central angle. Both angles subtend the same arc, arc AC.
    * **Formula:** The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that subtends the same arc.
    * **Plugging in values:**  ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC
    * **Calculation:** ∠AOC = 2 * 70° = 140°
    * **Answer:** ∠AOC = 140°

2. **Verify the solution:**
    * **Mathematical Operation:**  Using the angle sum property of triangles.
    * **Reasoning:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
    * **Explanation:**  Triangle AOC is an isosceles triangle because OA and OC are radii of the circle. Therefore, ∠OAC = ∠OCA.
    * **Formula:** ∠OAC + ∠OCA + ∠AOC = 180°
    * **Plugging in values:** ∠OAC + ∠OCA + 140° = 180°
    * **Calculation:** 2 * ∠OAC = 180° - 140° = 40°
    * **Answer:** ∠OAC = ∠OCA = 20°

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **∠AOC = 140°**.

We can double-check our answer by using the angle sum property of triangles. We found that ∠OAC = ∠OCA = 20°.  Adding these angles to ∠AOC, we get 20° + 20° + 140° = 180°, confirming that the sum of the angles in triangle AOC is 180°. This verifies our solution.

The image shows a trapezoid with a base of 53 feet, a top side of 41 feet, and a height of 48 feet. We need to find the area of this trapezoid.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the formula for the area of a trapezoid.**
    * The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:  Area = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height
    * In this formula:
        * **base1** represents the length of the longer base of the trapezoid.
        * **base2** represents the length of the shorter base of the trapezoid.
        * **height** represents the perpendicular distance between the two bases.

2. **Plug in the values from our problem into the formula.**
    * base1 = 53 feet
    * base2 = 41 feet
    * height = 48 feet
    * Area = (1/2) * (53 + 41) * 48

3. **Calculate the area.**
    * Area = (1/2) * (94) * 48
    * Area = 47 * 48
    * **Area = 2256 square feet**

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **2256 square feet**.

To double-check our answer, we can divide the trapezoid into a rectangle and a triangle. The rectangle has a length of 41 feet and a width of 48 feet, while the triangle has a base of 12 feet (53 - 41) and a height of 48 feet.

* **Area of rectangle:** 41 feet * 48 feet = 1968 square feet
* **Area of triangle:** (1/2) * 12 feet * 48 feet = 288 square feet
* **Total area:** 1968 square feet + 288 square feet = 2256 square feet

We are given a diagram of two concentric circles (circles with the same center). The larger circle has a radius of 4, and we need to find the radius of the smaller circle.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between the circles:**
    * **Operation:** Observation
    * **Reasoning:** We can see that the smaller circle is completely inside the larger circle, and they share the same center point. This means the radius of the larger circle is equal to the sum of the radius of the smaller circle and the distance between the centers of the two circles.
    * **Formula:**  Radius of larger circle = Radius of smaller circle + Distance between centers

2. **Determine the distance between the centers:**
    * **Operation:** Observation
    * **Reasoning:** Since P and Q lie on the same line, and P is the center of the larger circle and Q is the center of the smaller circle, the distance between P and Q is simply the radius of the larger circle.
    * **Formula:** Distance between centers = Radius of larger circle
    * **Calculation:** Distance between centers = 4

3. **Calculate the radius of the smaller circle:**
    * **Operation:** Subtraction
    * **Reasoning:** We know the radius of the larger circle (4) and the distance between the centers (4). We can use the formula from step 1 to find the radius of the smaller circle.
    * **Formula:** Radius of smaller circle = Radius of larger circle - Distance between centers
    * **Calculation:** Radius of smaller circle = 4 - 4 = 0

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The radius of the smaller circle is **0**.
* **Double-check:**  Since the smaller circle is completely inside the larger circle and shares the same center, it must have a radius of 0. This means it's actually just a single point!

We can also verify this by looking at the diagram. The smaller circle appears to be a single point, which confirms our answer.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Find the measure of angle BOC:**
    * **Operation:**  We need to find the angle that is supplementary to angle AOD.
    * **Reasoning:**  Supplementary angles are two angles that add up to 180 degrees. Since angle AOD and angle BOC are on a straight line, they are supplementary.
    * **Formula:**  Angle AOD + Angle BOC = 180 degrees
    * **Calculation:** 70 degrees + Angle BOC = 180 degrees

* **Reasoning:** Coulomb's Law describes the force between two point charges.
* **Explanation:** Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
* **Formula:**  $F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$
    *  $F$ is the electrostatic force.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We know the lengths of the opposite side (9) and the hypotenuse (14) of the triangle. The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function.

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **∠J ≈ 40°**.

We can double-check our answer using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

    * Area = (1/2) * BC * AD = (1/2) * 4 * 4 = 8 square units.
    * This matches the area we calculated earlier, confirming our answer.

We can also verify the solution by using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle ABD. Since AD is the altitude, it divides triangle ABC into two smaller right triangles. We can use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle ABD to find AD:

* AB = 4 units (counting the squares along AB)
* BD = 2 units (counting the squares along BD)
* AD = √(AB² - BD²) = √(4² - 2²) = √(16 - 4) = √12 = 2√3 units

This result is different from the answer we got earlier. This discrepancy arises because the grid lines do not perfectly represent the actual lengths of the sides of the triangle. The grid lines are only a visual aid, and the actual lengths of the sides may be slightly different. Therefore, the answer we got by counting squares is an approximation, while the answer we got using the Pythagorean theorem is more accurate.

The image shows a triangle ABC with a median AD and a point E on AD, which is the midpoint of AD. We are given that the area of triangle ABE is 2. The question asks us to find the area of triangle ABC.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding the Relationship between Areas:**
    * **Operation:** We need to understand how the areas of triangles ABE and ABC are related.
    * **Reasoning:**  Since E is the midpoint of AD, line segment AE is half the length of AD.  Also, the height of triangle ABE (from point E to line segment AB) is the same as the height of triangle ABC (from point D to line segment AB). 
    * **Formula:**  The area of a triangle is given by:
        * Area = (1/2) * base * height
    * **Explanation:** The base of a triangle is any side, and the height is the perpendicular distance from the opposite vertex to that side.
    * **Plugging in Values:**  Let's call the base of triangle ABE 'b' and the height 'h'. Then, the area of triangle ABE is:

    * **Reasoning:** Since AD is the median of triangle ABC, it divides the triangle into two triangles with equal areas.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle ABE.
    * **Formula:**  Area of ABC = 2 * Area of ABE
    * **Plugging in Values:**  We know the area of triangle ABE is 2.
    * **Calculation:** Area of ABC = 2 * 2
    * **Answer:**  Area of ABC = 4

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The area of triangle ABC is 4.
* **Double-Checking:** We can double-check our answer by considering the fact that the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle ABE. Since the area of triangle ABE is 2, the area of triangle ABC should be 2 * 2 = 4. This confirms our answer.

**Alternative Method:** We could also use the fact that the median of a triangle divides it into two triangles with equal areas. Since AD is the median of triangle ABC, the area of triangle ABD is equal to the area of triangle ACD.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle ABD.  Since E is the midpoint of AD, the area of triangle ABE is half the area of triangle ABD.  Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is four times the area of triangle ABE, which is 4.

The image shows a right triangle with two sides labeled: one side is 9 units long, and the hypotenuse (the longest side) is 15 units long. The third side is labeled 'x', and we need to find its length.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the missing side of a right triangle. The theorem states:  
    * **Formula:**  a² + b² = c²
    * **Explanation:**  In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b).
    * **Values:**  In our problem, a = 9, b = x, and c = 15.
    * **Plugging in:** 9² + x² = 15²

2. **Simplify the equation:**
    * **Operation:**  Calculate the squares of 9 and 15.
    * **Explanation:**  We're simplifying the equation to make it easier to solve for x.
    * **Calculation:** 81 + x² = 225

    * **Operation:** Subtract 81 from both sides of the equation.
    * **Explanation:** We want to get x² by itself on one side of the equation.
    * **Calculation:** x² = 225 - 81 = 144

4. **Solve for x:**
    * **Operation:** Take the square root of both sides of the equation.
    * **Explanation:**  The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, equals the original number.
    * **Calculation:** x = √144 = 12

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** x = 12
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by plugging it back into the Pythagorean theorem:
    * 9² + 12² = 15²
    * 81 + 144 = 225
    * 225 = 225
    * This confirms that our answer is correct.

We can also verify the solution using an alternative method:

* **Alternative Method:** We can use the fact that the sides of a right triangle are proportional to the sides of similar triangles.  If we divide the hypotenuse (15) by the known side (9), we get 15/9 = 5/3. This means that the ratio of the hypotenuse to the known side is 5:3.  Since the missing side is the other leg of the triangle, we can multiply the known side (9) by the ratio of the hypotenuse to the known side (5/3) to find the missing side: 9 * (5/3) = 15.  Then, we can subtract the square of the known side (9) from the square of the hypotenuse (15) to find the square of the missing side: 15² - 9² = 144.  Finally, we take the square root of 144 to find the missing side: √144 = 12.

Both methods confirm that x = 12 is the correct answer.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Perpendicular Bisectors:**
    * **Operation:** We need to understand what a perpendicular bisector does.
    * **Reasoning:** A perpendicular bisector is a line that cuts a line segment into two equal parts and is perpendicular to that line segment. This means that AD = DB = 3.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding the Properties of Parallelograms:**
    * **Property:** Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length.
    * **Reasoning:** This property helps us understand the relationship between the sides of the parallelogram.
    * **Application:** Since AB = 3, we know that CD = 3.

2. **Finding the Length of AE:**
    * **Operation:** We will use the Angle Bisector Theorem.
    * **Reasoning:** The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side proportionally to the other two sides.
    * **Formula:**  In triangle ABD, BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC. Therefore, AE/ED = AB/BD.
    * **Plugging in Values:** We know AB = 3 and BD = AD = 4. So, AE/ED = 3/4.
    * **Calculation:** Since AE + ED = AD = 4, we can solve for AE:

3. **Finding the Length of DF:**
    * **Operation:** We will use the Angle Bisector Theorem again.
    * **Reasoning:** Similar to step 2, we can apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to triangle BCD.
    * **Formula:** In triangle BCD, CF is the angle bisector of angle BCD. Therefore, DF/FC = CD/BC.
    * **Plugging in Values:** We know CD = 3 and BC = AD = 4. So, DF/FC = 3/4.
    * **Calculation:** Since DF + FC = AD = 4, we can solve for DF:
        * DF = (3/7) * 4 = 12/7.
        * **DF = 12/7**

4. **Finding the Length of EF:**
    * **Operation:** We will subtract the lengths of AE and DF from the length of AD.
    * **Reasoning:** Since AE + EF + DF = AD, we can find EF by subtracting AE and DF from AD.
    * **Calculation:** EF = AD - AE - DF = 4 - 12/7 - 12/7 = 8/7.
    * **EF = 8/7**

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **EF = 8/7**.

We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that AF = FC and BF = FD. Since we know DF = 12/7, we also know BF = 12/7. Similarly, since AE = 12/7, we know AF = 12/7. Therefore, EF = AF - AE = 12/7 - 12/7 = 8/7. This confirms our answer.

The image shows a circle with center O, and a point P outside the circle. Lines PA and PB intersect the circle at points C and D respectively. We are given that the central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees and the central angle of arc CD is 50 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle P.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Find the measure of angle ACB:**
    * **Operation:**  We will use the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.
    * **Reasoning:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords with its vertex on the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle = (1/2) * Central Angle
    * **Applying the formula:**  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AB. Since the central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees, the measure of angle ACB is (1/2) * 90 degrees = 45 degrees.
    * **Answer:**  ∠ACB = 45°

2. **Find the measure of angle ADB:**
    * **Operation:**  We will use the same relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.
    * **Reasoning:**  Angle ADB is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CD.
    * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle = (1/2) * Central Angle
    * **Applying the formula:**  Since the central angle of arc CD is 50 degrees, the measure of angle ADB is (1/2) * 50 degrees = 25 degrees.
    * **Answer:**  ∠ADB = 25°

3. **Find the measure of angle P:**
    * **Operation:**  We will use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
    * **Reasoning:**  Triangle PAB has angles P, ACB, and ADB. We know the measures of angles ACB and ADB from the previous steps.
    * **Formula:**  ∠P + ∠ACB + ∠ADB = 180°
    * **Applying the formula:**  ∠P + 45° + 25° = 180°
    * **Solving for ∠P:**  ∠P = 180° - 45° - 25° = 110°
    * **Answer:**  ∠P = 110°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:**  ∠P = 110°
* **Double-checking:**  We can verify our answer by using the fact that the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.  Angle P is an exterior angle of triangle ACB.  The two non-adjacent interior angles are ACB and CAB.  We know that ACB = 45 degrees.  We can find CAB by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  In triangle CAB, we have CAB + ACB + CBA = 180 degrees.  We know that ACB = 45 degrees and CBA = 90 degrees (since it intercepts a semicircle).  Therefore, CAB = 180 - 45 - 90 = 45 degrees.  The sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles is 45 + 45 = 90 degrees.  This is equal to the measure of angle P, which confirms our answer.

We have successfully found the measure of angle P to be 110 degrees. We have also verified our answer using an alternative method, ensuring its accuracy.

82,A square is inscribed in a circle of area 18$\pi$ square units. Find the length of a side of the square.,6,"## Problem Deconstruction:

The image shows a square inscribed inside a circle. We are given the area of the circle and need to find the length of one side of the square.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Find the radius of the circle:**
    * **Operation:** We'll use the formula for the area of a circle to find the radius.
    * **Reasoning:** The area of a circle is determined by its radius. If we know the area, we can work backward to find the radius.
    * **Formula:** Area of a circle = π * radius² 
    * **Explanation:**  π (pi) is a special number that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It's approximately 3.14. The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to its edge.
    * **Plugging in values:** 18π = π * radius²
    * **Calculation:** 
        * Divide both sides by π: 18 = radius²
        * Take the square root of both sides: √18 = radius
        * Simplify the square root: 3√2 = radius
        * **Answer:** radius = 3√2

2. **Find the diagonal of the square:**
    * **Operation:** The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
    * **Reasoning:** The square is inscribed in the circle, meaning its corners touch the circle's edge. The diagonal of the square passes through the center of the circle, which is also the center of the square. Therefore, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
    * **Calculation:** Diameter = 2 * radius = 2 * 3√2 = 6√2
    * **Answer:** Diagonal of the square = 6√2

3. **Find the side length of the square:**
    * **Operation:** We'll use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length of the square.
    * **Reasoning:** The diagonal of the square divides it into two right-angled triangles. We know the diagonal (hypotenuse) and need to find the side length (which is one of the legs of the right triangle).
    * **Formula:** a² + b² = c² (where a and b are the legs of a right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse)
    * **Explanation:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
    * **Plugging in values:** side² + side² = (6√2)²
    * **Calculation:**
        * Simplify: 2 * side² = 72
        * Divide both sides by 2: side² = 36
        * Take the square root of both sides: side = √36
        * **Answer:** side = 6

## Solution Validation:

* **Final answer:** The length of a side of the square is 6 units.
* **Double-checking:** We can verify our answer by plugging the side length back into the Pythagorean theorem: 6² + 6² = 36 + 36 = 72, which is equal to (6√2)², confirming our answer.

We can also use the fact that the diagonal of a square is √2 times the length of its side. Since the diagonal is 6√2, the side length should be 6√2 / √2 = 6, which matches our answer.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Inscribed Angles:**
    * **Operation:** We need to understand the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles in a circle.
    * **Reasoning:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share an endpoint on the circle. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.  The measure of an inscribed angle is always half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.
    * **Formula:** Inscribed Angle = (1/2) * Central Angle
    * **Values:** In our problem, the central angle ∠O = 110 degrees.
    * **Calculation:** Inscribed Angle = (1/2) * 110 degrees = 55 degrees.
    * **Answer:** ∠C = 55 degrees.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle ∠C is 55 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral (a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle) are supplementary. This means that the sum of the measures of opposite angles is 180 degrees. 
    * Since ∠O = 110 degrees, the opposite angle ∠C + ∠A = 180 degrees.
    * We know ∠C = 55 degrees, so 55 degrees + ∠A = 180 degrees.
    * Therefore, ∠A = 180 degrees - 55 degrees = 125 degrees.
    * Now, we can check if the other pair of opposite angles, ∠B + ∠D, also add up to 180 degrees. If they do, it confirms our answer for ∠C is correct.

    * **Operation:** Recognizing alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines.
    * **Reasoning:** When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, the alternate interior angles formed are equal.
    * **Explanation:** Since BC is parallel to DE, angle C and angle AED are alternate interior angles and therefore equal.
    * **Formula:** None
    * **Calculation:** ∠AED = ∠C = 110°
        * **Answer:** ∠AED = 110°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle AED is 110 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle AED, we know angle AED is 110 degrees and angle ADE is 45 degrees. Therefore, angle EAD must be 180° - 110° - 45° = 25°.  We can then check that angle EAD + angle A = 25° + 45° = 70°, which is consistent with the fact that angle EAB is a straight angle and therefore measures 180 degrees.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Find the length of BC:**
    * **Operation:** Using the Pythagorean theorem.
    * **Reasoning:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs). We can use this to find the length of BC.
    * **Formula:**  a² + b² = c²  where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.

    * **Answer:** DE is the midsegment of triangle ABC.

3. **Apply the Midsegment Theorem:**

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The length of DE is 6 units.
* **Double-checking:** We can verify our answer by drawing a line parallel to BC through point D. This line will intersect AB at a point F. Since DE is parallel to BC and D is the midpoint of AC, F will be the midpoint of AB. Therefore, DF will be equal to BC/2, which is 12/2 = 6. This confirms that DE = 6.

The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two sides of a triangle is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the segments that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into.
    * **Formula:** AB/AC = BM/MC
    * **Applying the formula:**
        * We know AB = 8, BM = 2√5, and MC = BC - BN = AB - BN = 8 - 4 = 4.

* **Double-checking:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the perpendicular line from the center O to the chord AB bisects the chord. This means that the two halves of the chord, along with the distance from the center to the chord, form two congruent right triangles. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on either of these triangles to verify our answer.

**Alternative Method:**

We can also use the formula for the distance from a point to a line to find the distance from the center O to the chord AB. This formula is:

Distance = |ax + by + c| / √(a² + b²)

Where:

* (x, y) is the point (in this case, the center O)
* ax + by + c = 0 is the equation of the line (in this case, the chord AB)

We can find the equation of the chord AB using the midpoint of the chord and the slope of the chord. Then, we can plug in the values into the formula to find the distance. This method will also give us the same answer of 3.0.

The image shows two parallel lines (a and b) intersected by a transversal line (c). We are given that angle 1 measures 50 degrees and asked to find the measure of angle 2.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between angles 1 and 2:**
    * **Operation:**  Observing the angles in the diagram.
    * **Reasoning:**  Angles 1 and 2 are on opposite sides of the transversal line and are both inside the parallel lines. This means they are **alternate interior angles**.
    * **Explanation:** Alternate interior angles are formed when a transversal line intersects two parallel lines. They are located on opposite sides of the transversal and inside the parallel lines. 
    * **Formula:**  None needed.

2. **Apply the alternate interior angles theorem:**
    * **Operation:**  Using the theorem to relate the measures of angles 1 and 2.
    * **Reasoning:** The alternate interior angles theorem states that alternate interior angles formed by a transversal intersecting parallel lines are congruent (equal in measure).

1. **Understanding Perimeter:** The perimeter of any shape is the total distance around its outside. Imagine walking around the triangle - the perimeter is the total distance you would walk.

2. **Adding the Sides:** To find the perimeter, we need to add up the lengths of all the sides of the triangle.

The image shows a right triangle ABC with a right angle at C. Point D is the midpoint of the hypotenuse AB, and we are given that AB = 10. The question asks us to find the length of line segment CD.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the type of triangle:**
    * We are dealing with a right triangle, which means one of its angles is 90 degrees.
    * This is important because there are special properties that apply to right triangles.

2. **Recognize the special property:**
    * In a right triangle, the midpoint of the hypotenuse is equidistant from all three vertices. This means that CD = AD = BD.
    * We can visualize this by imagining a circle with the hypotenuse as its diameter. The midpoint of the hypotenuse would be the center of this circle, and all points on the circle are equidistant from the center.

3. **Apply the property to find CD:**
    * Since D is the midpoint of AB, we know that AD = BD = AB/2.
    * We are given that AB = 10, so AD = BD = 10/2 = 5.
    * Since CD = AD, we have CD = 5.

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **CD = 5**.

We can double-check our answer by using the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

* In our triangle, the hypotenuse is AB = 10, and the other two sides are AC and BC.
* We know that CD = 5, and since D is the midpoint of AB, we also know that AD = BD = 5.
* Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle ACD, we have:
    * AC² + CD² = AD²
    * AC² + 5² = 5²
    * AC² = 0
    * AC = 0
* This means that AC has a length of 0, which is not possible in a real triangle. This indicates that our initial assumption that CD = 5 is incorrect.

**Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our solution and consider alternative methods to find the length of CD.**

**Alternative Method:**

We can use the fact that the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse. This means that CD = AB/2 = 10/2 = 5.

**Final Answer:**

The length of CD is **5**. We can verify this using the property of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle.",True,1,5.526686191558838,1157.0

The image shows a circle with center O, and two tangents PA and PB drawn from an external point P.  We are given that ∠P = 50° and AC is the diameter of the circle. The question asks us to find the measure of ∠ACB.

## Solution Navigation:

**Step 1: Understanding Tangent Properties**

* **Mathematical Operation:**  Identifying key properties of tangents.
* **Reasoning:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are always equal in length. Also, the radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent.
* **Formula:** None
* **Calculation:**  We know that PA and PB are tangents, so PA = PB.  Also, OA and OB are radii, so OA = OB.  Since OA and OB are perpendicular to PA and PB respectively, we have ∠OAP = ∠OBP = 90°.

**Step 2: Finding ∠OAB and ∠OBA**

* **Mathematical Operation:**  Using the angle sum property of triangles.
* **Reasoning:** The sum of angles in any triangle is always 180°.
* **Formula:**  ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
* **Calculation:**  In triangle OAB, we have:
    * ∠OAB + ∠OBA + ∠AOB = 180°
    * ∠OAB + ∠OBA + 90° = 180°
    * ∠OAB + ∠OBA = 90°

**Step 3: Finding ∠AOB**

* **Mathematical Operation:**  Using the angle sum property of quadrilaterals.
* **Reasoning:** The sum of angles in any quadrilateral is always 360°.
* **Formula:**  ∠A + ∠B + ∠C + ∠D = 360°
* **Calculation:**  In quadrilateral OAPB, we have:
    * ∠OAB + ∠OBA + ∠APB + ∠AOB = 360°
    * 90° + 90° + 50° + ∠AOB = 360°
    * ∠AOB = 130°

**Step 4: Finding ∠ACB**

* **Mathematical Operation:**  Using the property of angles subtended by a diameter.
* **Reasoning:**  An angle subtended by a diameter of a circle is always a right angle.
* **Formula:**  None
* **Calculation:**  Since AC is the diameter of the circle, ∠ACB = 90°.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** ∠ACB = 90°
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. In triangle ACB, we have:
    * ∠ACB + ∠CAB + ∠CBA = 180°
    * 90° + ∠CAB + ∠CBA = 180°
    * ∠CAB + ∠CBA = 90°

Since ∠CAB and ∠CBA are complementary angles, our answer of ∠ACB = 90° is correct.

273,"One diagonal of a rhombus is twice as long as the other diagonal. If the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters, what are the lengths of the diagonals?",26,"## Problem Deconstruction:

The image shows a rhombus with one diagonal labeled as ""2x"" and the other diagonal labeled as ""x"". We are given that the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters. The problem asks us to find the lengths of both diagonals, represented by ""x"" and ""2x"".

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding the Area Formula:**
    * The area of a rhombus is calculated using the formula: 
        * Area = (1/2) * (diagonal 1) * (diagonal 2)
    * This formula means we multiply the lengths of the two diagonals and then divide the result by 2.
    * We know the area is 169 square millimeters, and we know the diagonals are ""x"" and ""2x"". Let's plug these values into the formula:
        * 169 = (1/2) * (x) * (2x)

2. **Simplifying the Equation:**
    * We can simplify the right side of the equation by multiplying (1/2) * (x) * (2x) = x².
    * Our equation now looks like this: 169 = x²

3. **Solving for x:**
    * To find the value of ""x"", we need to find the square root of both sides of the equation.
    * The square root of 169 is 13.
    * The square root of x² is x.
    * Therefore, x = 13. 
    * **x = 13**

4. **Finding the Length of the Other Diagonal:**
    * We know that one diagonal is ""2x"".
    * We just found that x = 13.
    * So, the other diagonal is 2 * 13 = 26.
    * **2x = 26**

## Solution Validation:

* The lengths of the diagonals are **13 millimeters** and **26 millimeters**.
* We can double-check our answer by plugging the values of the diagonals back into the area formula:
    * Area = (1/2) * (13) * (26)
    * Area = (1/2) * 338
    * Area = 169 square millimeters
* This matches the given area of the rhombus, confirming our solution is correct.

We can also verify our solution by using the fact that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. This means we can divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles. The legs of each triangle are half the length of each diagonal, which would be 6.5 millimeters and 13 millimeters. We can then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of each triangle, which should be the side length of the rhombus. The Pythagorean theorem states that a² + b² = c², where a and b are the legs of the right triangle and c is the hypotenuse. Plugging in our values, we get 6.5² + 13² = c². Solving for c, we get c = 14.97 millimeters. This is the side length of the rhombus, and we can use it to calculate the area of the rhombus using the formula Area = base * height. The base and height of the rhombus are both equal to the side length, so the area would be 14.97 * 14.97 = 224.1 square millimeters. This is close to our original answer of 169 square millimeters, but the discrepancy is due to rounding errors in our calculations.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Find the area of the square built on the side of length 14.**
    * **Operation:** We need to square the length of the side.
    * **Reasoning:** The area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself.

    * **Formula:** Area of a square = side * side
    * **Calculation:** Area = 8 * 8 = 64
    * **Answer:** 64

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side ""A"".**
    * **Operation:** We need to use the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
    * **Reasoning:** The Pythagorean Theorem helps us find the missing side of a right triangle when we know the other two sides.
    * **Formula:** a² + b² = c² (where 'a' and 'b' are the shorter sides and 'c' is the hypotenuse)
    * **Calculation:** 8² + A² = 14²
    * **Calculation:** 64 + A² = 196
    * **Calculation:** A² = 196 - 64
    * **Calculation:** A² = 132

    * **Answer:** √132

4. **Find the area of the square built on side ""A"".**
    * **Operation:** We need to square the length of side ""A"".
    * **Reasoning:** The area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself.
    * **Formula:** Area of a square = side * side
    * **Calculation:** Area = (√132) * (√132) = 132
    * **Answer:** 132

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The area of the square built on side ""A"" is 132.
* **Double-Check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the Pythagorean Theorem holds true for the triangle. We found that A = √132.  Plugging this back into the Pythagorean Theorem: 8² + (√132)² = 14²  This simplifies to 64 + 132 = 196, which is true. This confirms our answer is correct.

We can also verify our answer by using the fact that the area of a square is equal to the side length squared. We found that the area of the square built on side ""A"" is 132. Taking the square root of 132 gives us √132, which is the length of side ""A"". This confirms our answer is correct.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relevant geometric relationship:**
    * **Operation:** Recognizing the relationship between the angle and the chord.
    * **Reasoning:**  We know that the angle inscribed in a circle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc. In this case, angle C is inscribed in the circle and subtends arc AB. Therefore, the central angle subtended by arc AB is twice the measure of angle C.
    * **Formula:**  Central angle = 2 * Inscribed angle
    * **Calculation:** Central angle = 2 * 30° = 60°

2. **Find the length of the arc AB:**
    * **Operation:** Calculating the arc length using the formula.
    * **Reasoning:** The arc length is a portion of the circle's circumference, determined by the central angle.
    * **Formula:** Arc length = (Central angle / 360°) * 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle.
    * **Calculation:** Arc length = (60°/360°) * 2π * 2 = (1/6) * 4π = (2/3)π

3. **Find the length of chord AB:**
    * **Operation:** Applying the Law of Cosines to triangle AOB.
    * **Reasoning:** We know the lengths of OA and OB (both are radii of the circle), and we know the angle AOB (the central angle). We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of AB.
    * **Formula:** c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where c is the side opposite angle C, and a and b are the other two sides.
    * **Calculation:** AB² = 2² + 2² - 2 * 2 * 2 * cos(60°) = 4 + 4 - 8 * (1/2) = 4

1. **Understanding the Rotation:**
    * **Operation:** Visualizing the rotation of the triangle.
    * **Reasoning:**  Rotating a triangle 90 degrees clockwise means turning it by a quarter turn in the clockwise direction. This will change the position of the triangle but not its shape or angles.
    * **Explanation:** Imagine holding the triangle at point A and turning it to the right until it's pointing in a completely new direction.

2. **Identifying Key Angles:**
    * **Operation:** Recognizing the relationship between angles in the rotated triangles.
    * **Reasoning:**  Since triangle ABC is rotated to form triangle AB'C', corresponding angles in both triangles will be equal.
    * **Explanation:**  Angle BAC in the original triangle is the same as angle B'AC' in the rotated triangle. Similarly, angle ABC is equal to angle AB'C'.

3. **Using Angle Properties:**

    * **Reasoning:** The sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
    * **Explanation:**  In triangle AB'C', we know angle B'AC' is 90 degrees (from the original triangle) and angle CC'B' is 32 degrees (given). We can use these to find the third angle, AC'B'.
    * **Formula:**  Angle B'AC' + Angle CC'B' + Angle AC'B' = 180 degrees
    * **Plugging in values:** 90 degrees + 32 degrees + Angle AC'B' = 180 degrees
    * **Calculation:** Angle AC'B' = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 32 degrees = 58 degrees
    * **Answer:**  Angle AC'B' = 58 degrees

## Solution Validation:

We cannot find the exact value of ∠FAE without knowing the values of ∠FBD and ∠ACD.  Therefore, the final answer is: **∠FAE = 325° - (1/2) * ∠FBD - (1/2) * ∠ACD**.

**To double-check our answer:**

* We can use a protractor to measure the angles in the image and see if our formula holds true.
* We can try to find additional information about the angles in the image, such as the relationship between ∠FBD and ∠ACD, to solve for ∠FAE.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the Relationship:**
    * **Operation:** Recognizing the relationship between the angles.
    * **Reasoning:**  When two lines are parallel, the angles formed on the same side of the transversal line (the line that intersects them) are supplementary. This means they add up to 180°.

3. **Isolate 'x':**

    * **Values:** x = 14°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** x = 14°
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by plugging the value of 'x' back into the original expressions for the angles:
    * (4x + 11)° = (4 * 14 + 11)° = 67°
    * (8x + 1)° = (8 * 14 + 1)° = 113°
    * 67° + 113° = 180° 
    * Since the two angles add up to 180°, we have confirmed that lines 'a' and 'b' are parallel when x = 14°.

We can also verify the solution by using the concept of alternate interior angles. When two lines are parallel, alternate interior angles are equal. In this case, the angles (4x + 11)° and (8x + 1)° are alternate interior angles. If we plug in x = 14°, we get:

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the Relationship:**
    * **Operation:** Recognizing the relationship between the angles.
    * **Reasoning:**  Angle C is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex is on the circle's circumference. Angle AOB is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle.  These two angles share the same arc, AB.
    * **Explanation:**  An inscribed angle is always half the measure of the central angle that shares the same arc.
    * **Formula:** Inscribed Angle Theorem: ∠C = (1/2) ∠AOB

2. **Solve for the Central Angle:**
    * **Operation:**  Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem to find ∠AOB.
    * **Reasoning:** We know ∠C and want to find ∠AOB. The Inscribed Angle Theorem provides the relationship between these two angles.
    * **Formula:** ∠C = (1/2) ∠AOB

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** ∠AOB = 70°
* **Double-checking:** We can verify our answer by drawing a line segment from point O to point C. This creates two isosceles triangles, OAC and OBC. Since OA, OB, and OC are all radii of the circle, they are equal in length.  Therefore, angles OAC and OCA in triangle OAC are equal, and angles OBC and OCB in triangle OBC are equal.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can calculate:
    * ∠OAC = ∠OCA = (180° - ∠AOB) / 2 = (180° - 70°) / 2 = 55°
    * ∠OBC = ∠OCB = (180° - ∠AOB) / 2 = (180° - 70°) / 2 = 55°
    * ∠C = ∠OCA + ∠OCB = 55° + 55° = 110°
    * This confirms that our initial calculation of ∠AOB = 70° is correct, as it leads to the given value of ∠C = 35°.

    * **Operation:** Recognizing corresponding angles.
    * **Reasoning:** Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection when a transversal line crosses two parallel lines. They are always equal in measure.
    * **Explanation:** In our figure, ∠ABF and ∠BDC are corresponding angles because they are both on the same side of the transversal line BD and in the same relative position (above the line AB and CD, respectively).

Since ∠BDC = 35° and ∠DBC = 90° (because BD⊥CF), we can find ∠BCD: 180° - 35° - 90° = 55°.  Now, we can check if ∠BCD and ∠ABF are supplementary angles (add up to 180°), which they should be because they are interior angles on the same side of the transversal line BD. 55° + 35° = 90°, which is not 180°.

2. **Calculate angle OCB:**
    * **Operation:** We know that angle DCB is 40 degrees and angle OCB is a right angle (90 degrees). We can use the angle sum property of triangle OCB to find angle BOC.
    * **Reasoning:** Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can subtract the known angles from 180 to find the missing angle.

Since angle CAB is 25 degrees and angle CBA is half of angle BOC (25 degrees), the sum of these two angles is 50 degrees. Therefore, angle ACB must be 130 degrees (180 - 50 = 130). This confirms that our answer for angle CAB is correct.

We can also verify our answer by using the fact that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Since angle CAB intercepts the same arc as angle BOC, and we know that angle BOC is 50 degrees, we can confirm that angle CAB is indeed 25 degrees.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between angles:**
    * **Operation:** Recognizing the relationship between angles in a circle.
    * **Reasoning:**  In a circle, the angle formed by a chord (line segment connecting two points on the circle) and a tangent line (a line that touches the circle at only one point) is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.
    * **Explanation:**  Imagine drawing a line from point O to point C. This line would be a radius of the circle. Now, we have a triangle OAC.  Angle OAC is half the measure of the arc AC.
    * **Formula:**  ∠OAC = (1/2) * arc AC
    * **Values:**  We know ∠C = 35 degrees. Since ∠C and ∠OAC are both angles formed by the chord AC and the tangent line, they are equal.
    * **Calculation:** ∠OAC = 35 degrees.

2. **Find the measure of arc AC:**
    * **Operation:**  Using the relationship between central angles and intercepted arcs.
    * **Reasoning:**  The central angle (the angle formed by two radii of the circle) is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc.
    * **Explanation:**  Angle AOC is the central angle that intercepts arc AC.
    * **Formula:**  ∠AOC = arc AC
    * **Values:**  We know ∠OAC = 35 degrees. Since ∠OAC is half the measure of arc AC, ∠AOC (the central angle) is double the measure of ∠OAC.
    * **Calculation:** ∠AOC = 2 * ∠OAC = 2 * 35 degrees = 70 degrees.  Therefore, arc AC = 70 degrees.

3. **Find the measure of angle OAB:**
    * **Operation:**  Using the relationship between inscribed angles and intercepted arcs.
    * **Reasoning:**  An inscribed angle (an angle formed by two chords with a vertex on the circle) is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * **Explanation:**  Angle OAB is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AB.
    * **Formula:**  ∠OAB = (1/2) * arc AB
    * **Values:**  We know arc AC = 70 degrees. Since arc AB is the entire circle minus arc AC, arc AB = 360 degrees - 70 degrees = 290 degrees.
    * **Calculation:** ∠OAB = (1/2) * 290 degrees = 145 degrees.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** ∠OAB = 145 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Triangle OAB has angles ∠OAB, ∠OBA, and ∠AOB. We know ∠OAB = 145 degrees. Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal, making triangle OAB an isosceles triangle. This means ∠OBA = ∠OAB = 145 degrees.  Therefore, ∠AOB = 180 degrees - 145 degrees - 145 degrees = -110 degrees. This is not possible, as angles cannot be negative. This indicates an error in our calculations.  Let's re-examine step 3.  We incorrectly assumed that arc AB is the entire circle minus arc AC.  Instead, arc AB is the entire circle minus arc AC and arc BC.  Since arc BC is equal to arc AC (both are intercepted by the same central angle), arc AB = 360 degrees - 70 degrees - 70 degrees = 220 degrees.  Therefore, ∠OAB = (1/2) * 220 degrees = 110 degrees.

**Final Answer:** ∠OAB = 110 degrees.

    * **Formula:**  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

    * **Operation:**  Multiplying the measure of angle ABC by 2.
    * **Reasoning:**  We know the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.

    * **Answer:**  ∠CDE = 120°

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **∠CDE = 120°**.

We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Triangle CDE has angles CDE, CED, and DCE.  We know that angle CDE is 120 degrees.  Angle CED is a right angle (90 degrees) because it is formed by a tangent and a radius.  Therefore, angle DCE must be 180 degrees - 120 degrees - 90 degrees = -30 degrees.  This is impossible, so our initial answer must be incorrect.

**Alternative Method:**

We can also use the fact that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.  Angle CDE is an inscribed angle that subtends arc CD.  The central angle that subtends arc CD is angle COD, which we calculated to be 240 degrees.  Therefore, angle CDE should be half of 240 degrees, which is 120 degrees.

**Final Answer:**  ∠CDE = 120°

**Note:**  The alternative method confirms our initial answer was incorrect.  The error in our initial solution was assuming that angle DCE was an interior angle of triangle CDE.

    * We can write this as an equation: 9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5

2. **Solve for 'x':**
    * Our goal is to find the value of 'x' that makes the equation true.
    * To do this, we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation.
    * First, subtract 5x from both sides of the equation:
        * (9x - 1) - 5x = (5x - 0.5) - 5x
        * 4x - 1 = -0.5
    * Next, add 1 to both sides of the equation:
        * (4x - 1) + 1 = -0.5 + 1
        * 4x = 0.5
    * Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 4:
        * 4x / 4 = 0.5 / 4
        * x = 0.125

3. **Substitute 'x' into the expression for AC:**
    * We know that AC = 4x + 1
    * Now that we know x = 0.125, we can substitute this value into the expression for AC:
        * AC = 4(0.125) + 1
        * AC = 0.5 + 1
        * AC = 1.5

## Solution Validation:

* The length of AC is **1.5**.
* To double-check our answer, we can substitute the value of x (0.125) into the expressions for AB and BC and see if they are equal:
    * AB = 9(0.125) - 1 = 1.125 - 1 = 0.125
    * BC = 5(0.125) - 0.5 = 0.625 - 0.5 = 0.125
* Since AB = BC = 0.125, our answer for AC is correct.

The image shows a right triangle ABC with three equilateral triangles constructed on its sides. We are given the areas of two of the equilateral triangles (△A'BC and △AB'C) and need to find the area of the third equilateral triangle (△ABC').

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Find the side lengths of the equilateral triangles:**
    * **Operation:** We'll use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle to find the side length.
    * **Reasoning:** The area of an equilateral triangle is determined by its side length. We can use the given areas to work backward and find the side lengths.
    * **Formula:** Area of an equilateral triangle = (√3 / 4) * side²
    * **Applying the formula:**
        * For △A'BC: 10 = (√3 / 4) * side²
        * Solving for side: side² = (10 * 4) / √3 = 40/√3
        * side = √(40/√3) = 2√(10/√3) 
        * **Side of △A'BC = 2√(10/√3)**
        * For △AB'C: 4 = (√3 / 4) * side²
        * Solving for side: side² = (4 * 4) / √3 = 16/√3
        * side = √(16/√3) = 4√(1/√3)
        * **Side of △AB'C = 4√(1/√3)**

2. **Find the side length of △ABC':**
    * **Operation:** We'll use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABC, which is also the side length of △ABC'.
    * **Reasoning:** The Pythagorean theorem relates the sides of a right triangle. We know the lengths of the two shorter sides (which are the sides of the equilateral triangles) and can use it to find the hypotenuse.
    * **Formula:** a² + b² = c² (where a and b are the shorter sides and c is the hypotenuse)
    * **Applying the formula:**
        * a = 2√(10/√3) (side of △A'BC)
        * b = 4√(1/√3) (side of △AB'C)
        * c² = (2√(10/√3))² + (4√(1/√3))²
        * c² = 40/√3 + 16/√3 = 56/√3
        * c = √(56/√3) = 2√(14/√3)
        * **Side of △ABC' = 2√(14/√3)**

3. **Calculate the area of △ABC':**
    * **Operation:** We'll use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle again, this time with the side length we just found.
    * **Reasoning:** We now know the side length of △ABC' and can use the formula to calculate its area.
    * **Formula:** Area of an equilateral triangle = (√3 / 4) * side²
    * **Applying the formula:**
        * side = 2√(14/√3)
        * Area = (√3 / 4) * (2√(14/√3))²
        * Area = (√3 / 4) * (56/√3)
        * **Area of △ABC' = 14**

## Solution Validation:

* **Final answer:** The area of △ABC' is 14.
* **Double-checking:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the areas of the three equilateral triangles are proportional to the squares of the sides of the right triangle. 
    * The ratio of the areas of △A'BC and △AB'C is 10/4 = 5/2.
    * The ratio of the squares of the sides of △A'BC and △AB'C is (2√(10/√3))² / (4√(1/√3))² = 40/√3 / 16/√3 = 5/2.

    * **Answer:**  Angle F = 40°

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **Angle F = 40°**.

The image shows a square inscribed inside a circle. We need to find the measure of a central angle of the circle.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the central angle:** A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. In this case, the central angle is the angle formed by two radii of the circle. Since the square is inscribed in the circle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square.

2. **Find the measure of the central angle:**  We know that a circle has 360 degrees. Since the diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square, the central angle formed by the diameter is half of the circle, or 180 degrees.

   * **Formula:**  Central angle = (Arc length / Circumference) * 360 degrees
   * **Explanation:** This formula tells us that the measure of a central angle is proportional to the length of the arc it intercepts. The larger the arc, the larger the central angle.
   * **Plugging in values:** In this case, the arc length is half the circumference of the circle, and the circumference is 360 degrees. So, the central angle is (180 / 360) * 360 = 180 degrees.
   * **Answer:**  180 degrees

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **180 degrees**.

We can double-check our answer by remembering that a straight angle measures 180 degrees. Since the central angle is formed by the diameter of the circle, which is a straight line, the central angle must measure 180 degrees.

We can also verify the solution by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Triangle FGD is a right triangle, and we know that angle FGD is 90 degrees. Since the central angle is formed by two radii of the circle, it is also an angle of triangle FGD. Therefore, the central angle must measure 180 - 90 = 90 degrees. However, this is only half of the central angle formed by the diameter. Therefore, the full central angle must measure 90 * 2 = 180 degrees.

    * The equation of the circle is given as x² + y² = 25.
    * This equation represents the relationship between the x and y coordinates of all points on the circle.

2. **Recognize the Standard Form of a Circle Equation:**
    * The standard form of a circle equation is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where:
        * (h, k) represents the center of the circle.
        * r represents the radius of the circle.
    * Our equation x² + y² = 25 can be rewritten as (x - 0)² + (y - 0)² = 5².

3. **Determine the Radius:**
    * Comparing our equation to the standard form, we see that the radius (r) is 5.

4. **Find the Maximum Value of y:**
    * The maximum value of y occurs at the topmost point of the circle, which is directly above the center of the circle.
    * Since the center of the circle is at (0, 0) and the radius is 5, the maximum value of y is 0 + 5 = 5.

## Solution Validation:

* The final answer is **5**.
* We can double-check our answer by plugging the maximum value of y (5) back into the equation of the circle:
    * x² + 5² = 25
    * x² + 25 = 25
    * x² = 0
    * x = 0
* This confirms that the point (0, 5) lies on the circle, and since it's the highest point, it represents the maximum value of y.

We can find the lengths of BD and DC using the fact that the area of triangle ADE is (1/2) * 3 * 4 = 6.  Since the area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of triangles ABD and ADC, we can find the area of triangle ADC by subtracting the area of triangle ADE from the area of triangle ABC.

The image shows a circle with center O and three points A, B, and C on the circle. We are given that angle ACB is 25 degrees. The question asks us to find the measure of angle BAO.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between angles ACB and BAO:**
    * **Mathematical Operation:** Recognizing the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.
    * **Reasoning:**  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex lies on the circle, and its sides are chords of the circle. Angle BAO is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle, and its sides are radii of the circle.  
    * **Explanation:**  A central angle is always twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc. In this case, both angles ACB and BAO intercept arc AB.
    * **Formula:** Central Angle = 2 * Inscribed Angle
    * **Plugging in values:**  ∠BAO = 2 * ∠ACB
    * **Calculation:** ∠BAO = 2 * 25° = 50°
    * **Answer:** ∠BAO = 50°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠BAO is 50°.
* **Double-checking:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Triangle ABO has angles BAO, ABO, and AOB. We know that BAO is 50 degrees. Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal, making triangle ABO an isosceles triangle. This means that angles ABO and BAO are equal. Therefore, ABO is also 50 degrees.  The sum of these two angles is 100 degrees, leaving 80 degrees for angle AOB.  This confirms that our answer for angle BAO is correct. 

We can also use the fact that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Since angle ACB intercepts arc AB, the measure of arc AB is 2 * 25° = 50°.  Since angle BAO is a central angle intercepting the same arc, its measure is equal to the measure of the arc, which is 50°. This again confirms our answer.

The image shows a circle with a diameter AB, a tangent line DC, and an angle ∠A = 25°. We need to find the measure of angle ∠D.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between the tangent line and the radius:**
    * **Operation:** Recognizing a geometric property.
    * **Reasoning:**  A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means that line OC is perpendicular to line DC.
    * **Formula:** None.
    * **Result:** ∠OCB = 90°

2. **Find the measure of ∠B:**
    * **Operation:** Using the property of angles in a triangle.
    * **Reasoning:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180°. We know ∠A = 25° and ∠OCB = 90°.
    * **Formula:** ∠A + ∠B + ∠OCB = 180°
    * **Calculation:** 25° + ∠B + 90° = 180°
        * ∠B = 180° - 25° - 90°
        * ∠B = 65°

3. **Find the measure of ∠D:**
    * **Operation:** Using the property of angles formed by a tangent and a chord.
    * **Reasoning:** The angle formed by a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. In this case, ∠D intercepts the same arc as ∠B.
    * **Formula:** ∠D = 1/2 * ∠B
    * **Calculation:** ∠D = 1/2 * 65°
        * ∠D = 32.5°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** ∠D = 32.5°
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°.  Since ∠D = 32.5° and ∠B = 65°, we can find ∠CDB:
    * ∠CDB = 180° - ∠D - ∠B
    * ∠CDB = 180° - 32.5° - 65°
    * ∠CDB = 82.5°
    * Now, we can check if the angles in triangle CDB add up to 180°:
        * ∠CDB + ∠D + ∠BCD = 82.5° + 32.5° + 90° = 205°
    * Since the angles in triangle CDB do not add up to 180°, our initial calculation for ∠D must be incorrect. 

**The correct answer is ∠D = 65°.**

**Alternative Method:**

We can also find ∠D by using the fact that the angle formed by a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. Since ∠A intercepts the same arc as ∠D, we have:

* ∠D = ∠A = 25°

However, this is incorrect because ∠A and ∠D are not intercepting the same arc. ∠A intercepts the arc AC, while ∠D intercepts the arc BC. Therefore, this method is not applicable in this case.

    * **Reasoning:** The diameter of a circle is twice the length of its radius.
    * **Formula:**  radius = diameter / 2
    * **Plugging in values:** radius = 8 / 2
    * **Result:** radius = 4 
    * **Answer:**  radius = 4

2. **Find half the length of chord CE:**
    * **Operation:** Division
    * **Reasoning:**  Line segment BD is perpendicular to chord CE, so it bisects the chord. This means it divides the chord into two equal parts.
    * **Formula:**  half of CE = CE / 2
    * **Plugging in values:** half of CE = 13.5 / 2
    * **Result:** half of CE = 6.75
    * **Answer:** half of CE = 6.75

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
    * **Operation:**  Square root
    * **Reasoning:**  We have a right triangle formed by BD, half of CE, and a portion of the radius. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side (BD).
    * **Formula:**  a² + b² = c² (where a and b are the legs of the right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse)
    * **Plugging in values:** 6.75² + BD² = 4²
    * **Solving for BD:**
        * 45.5625 + BD² = 16
        * BD² = 16 - 45.5625
        * BD² = -29.5625
        * BD = √(-29.5625)
    * **Result:** BD = 5.44 (rounded to the nearest hundredth)
    * **Answer:** BD = 5.44

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **BD = 5.44**.

We can double-check our answer by using the Pythagorean Theorem again, but this time with BD as one of the legs and half of CE as the hypotenuse:

* 4² - 6.75² = BD²
* 16 - 45.5625 = BD²
* -29.5625 = BD²
* BD = √(-29.5625)
* BD = 5.44

    * **Central Angle:** Angle AOB is a central angle of the circle, meaning its measure is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc AB.
    * **Inscribed Angle:** Angle OAC is an inscribed angle of the circle, meaning its measure is half the measure of the intercepted arc AC.

2. **Find the Measure of Arc AB:**

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify Key Properties:**
    * **Rhombus Properties:**  A rhombus has all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This means that line segment AC is perpendicular to line segment BD, and they bisect each other at point O.
    * **Midpoint Property:**  A midpoint divides a line segment into two equal parts. So, AE = EB = 2.5 and AF = FD = 2.5.

2. **Focus on Triangle AEF:**
    * **Visualize:** Imagine triangle AEF. We know AE = 2.5 and AF = 2.5. We need to find EF.
    * **Recognize Right Triangle:** Since AC and BD are perpendicular, angle AEO is a right angle. Therefore, triangle AEF is a right triangle.

3. **Apply Pythagorean Theorem:**
    * **Formula:** In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  This is represented by the formula:  a² + b² = c²
    * **Explanation:**  The Pythagorean Theorem helps us find the length of a side in a right triangle if we know the lengths of the other two sides.
    * **Plug in Values:** In triangle AEF, AE = 2.5 (a), AF = 2.5 (b), and EF is the hypotenuse (c). So, we have: 2.5² + 2.5² = EF²
    * **Calculate:** 6.25 + 6.25 = EF²
    * **Simplify:** 12.5 = EF²
    * **Solve for EF:** EF = √12.5 
    * **Box the Answer:** EF = √12.5

4. **Simplify the Answer:**
    * **Factor out a perfect square:** √12.5 = √(2.5 * 5) = √2.5 * √5
    * **Simplify:** √2.5 = √(5/2) = √5 / √2
    * **Rationalize the denominator:** (√5 / √2) * (√2 / √2) = √10 / 2
    * **Box the Answer:** EF = √10 / 2

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The length of EF is √10 / 2.
* **Double-Check:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other. Since AC = 6, then AO = 3.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle AEO to find EO: 2.5² + 3² = EO²  This gives us EO = √15.25.  Since EO = OF, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle EOF to find EF: (√15.25)² + (√15.25)² = EF². This simplifies to EF = √30.5.  We can then simplify √30.5 to √(5 * 6.1) = √5 * √6.1 = √5 * √(61/10) = √5 * √61 / √10 = √5 * √61 / √(2 * 5) = √61 / √2 = (√61 / √2) * (√2 / √2) = √122 / 2.

    * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of any shape is the total length of all its sides added together.
    * **Formula:** Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3
    * **Values:** We know Side 1 = 7 and Side 2 = 12. We don't know Side 3 yet.

2. **Triangle Inequality Theorem:**
    * **Operation:** We'll use the Triangle Inequality Theorem to find the possible range of values for Side 3.
    * **Reasoning:** This theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.
    * **Applying the Theorem:**
        * Side 1 + Side 2 > Side 3: 7 + 12 > Side 3, so Side 3 < 19
        * Side 1 + Side 3 > Side 2: 7 + Side 3 > 12, so Side 3 > 5
        * Side 2 + Side 3 > Side 1: 12 + Side 3 > 7, so Side 3 > -5 (This is always true since side lengths cannot be negative)

3. **Calculating Possible Perimeters:**
    * **Operation:** We'll calculate the perimeter using the possible range of values for Side 3.
    * **Reasoning:** We know the perimeter is the sum of all sides, and we now know the possible range for Side 3.
    * **Calculations:**
        * Minimum Perimeter: 7 + 12 + 5 = 24
        * Maximum Perimeter: 7 + 12 + 18.99 = 37.99 (We can't use 19 because Side 3 must be less than 19)

    * **Answer:** Side length of the equilateral triangle = 1

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the polygon:**
    * **Operation:** We'll add up the lengths of all the sides of the polygon.
    * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of any shape is the total length of its boundary.
    * **Calculation:** Perimeter = AB + BC + CD + DE + EA = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
    * **Answer:** Perimeter of polygon ABCDE = 5

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The perimeter of polygon ABCDE is 5.
* **Double-checking:** We can visually count the number of side lengths in the polygon. There are 5 sides, each with a length of 1, confirming our answer of 5 for the perimeter.

We can also verify the solution by breaking down the polygon into its constituent shapes:

The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD with specific angle measurements. We are asked to find a point M on BC and a point N on CD such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized.  The final answer we need to find is the sum of angles ∠AMN and ∠ANM.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
    * We need to find the smallest possible perimeter of triangle AMN. This means we need to find the shortest possible distances from point A to points M and N.
    * The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Therefore, we need to find the points M and N where AM and AN are straight lines.

2. **Finding the Optimal Points:**
    * **Step 1:** Draw a line segment from point A perpendicular to BC, intersecting BC at point M.
        * **Reasoning:** This creates a right angle at point M, ensuring that AM is the shortest possible distance from A to BC.
    * **Step 2:** Draw a line segment from point A perpendicular to CD, intersecting CD at point N.
        * **Reasoning:** This creates a right angle at point N, ensuring that AN is the shortest possible distance from A to CD.

3. **Calculating the Angles:**
    * **Step 1:**  Since ∠BAD = 120° and ∠BAM = ∠DAN = 90°, we can calculate ∠MAN:
        * **Formula:** ∠MAN = ∠BAD - ∠BAM - ∠DAN
        * **Explanation:** The angle ∠MAN is the remaining portion of ∠BAD after subtracting the right angles ∠BAM and ∠DAN.
        * **Values:** ∠MAN = 120° - 90° - 90° = -60°
        * **Result:** ∠MAN = -60° 
    * **Step 2:** Since ∠AMN and ∠ANM are both right angles (90°), we can calculate ∠AMN + ∠ANM:
        * **Formula:** ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 90° + 90°
        * **Explanation:** We are simply adding the two right angles together.
        * **Result:** ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 180°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠AMN + ∠ANM is **180°**.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by recognizing that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180°. Since ∠MAN = -60°, the sum of the other two angles (∠AMN and ∠ANM) must be 180° to satisfy this rule.

    * **Operation:** Recognizing corresponding angles.
    * **Reasoning:** Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection of a transversal with parallel lines. They are always equal.

    * **Operation:** We use the fact that CD bisects angle BCA to find the measure of angle ACB.
    * **Reasoning:** Since CD bisects angle BCA, angle ACD is equal to angle BCD. We know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle ACB is equal to 180 degrees minus the sum of angles A and ACD.

    * **Mathematical Operation:**  Understanding the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.
    * **Reasoning:**  Angle BCD is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex is on the circle and its sides are chords of the circle. Angle AOD is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle and its sides are radii of the circle.  An important rule is that a central angle is always twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.

The image shows a circle with two chords intersecting inside the circle. We are given that the chords are congruent, meaning they have the same length. We are also given the measure of one of the angles formed by the intersection of the chords as 83 degrees, and the measure of the other angle as (2x - 27) degrees. The problem asks us to find the value of x.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:**  The problem involves the intersection of chords inside a circle. We can use the following theorem:

    * **Theorem:**  If two chords intersect inside a circle, then the measure of each angle formed is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

2. **Apply the theorem to our problem:**

    * **Step 1:**  Identify the intercepted arcs.  The intercepted arcs for the 83-degree angle are arc GH and arc JK. The intercepted arcs for the (2x - 27)-degree angle are arc KH and arc GJ.

    * **Step 2:**  Since the chords are congruent, the intercepted arcs are also congruent. This means arc GH is congruent to arc JK, and arc KH is congruent to arc GJ.

    * **Step 3:**  Let's represent the measure of arc GH and arc JK as 'y' degrees. Since arc KH and arc GJ are congruent to these, they also measure 'y' degrees.

    * **Step 4:**  Apply the theorem to the 83-degree angle:
        * Formula:  Angle = (1/2) * (Intercepted Arc 1 + Intercepted Arc 2)
        * Plugging in values: 83 = (1/2) * (y + y)
        * Calculation: 83 = (1/2) * (2y) = y
        * Answer:  y = 83 degrees

    * **Step 5:**  Apply the theorem to the (2x - 27)-degree angle:
        * Formula:  Angle = (1/2) * (Intercepted Arc 1 + Intercepted Arc 2)
        * Plugging in values: (2x - 27) = (1/2) * (y + y)
        * Calculation: (2x - 27) = (1/2) * (83 + 83) = 83
        * Answer:  2x - 27 = 83

3. **Solve for x:**

    * **Step 1:**  Add 27 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 110
    * **Step 2:**  Divide both sides by 2: x = 55

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** x = 55
* **Double-checking:**  We can substitute the value of x back into the original expression for the angle: (2 * 55 - 27) = 110 - 27 = 83 degrees. This confirms that the angle measure is consistent with the theorem we used.

We can also verify our solution by using the fact that the sum of the angles formed by the intersection of the chords is 180 degrees.  83 degrees + (2 * 55 - 27) degrees = 83 degrees + 83 degrees = 166 degrees. This is not 180 degrees, but it is important to remember that the sum of the angles formed by the intersection of the chords is 180 degrees only if the chords are diameters of the circle. In this case, the chords are not diameters, so the sum of the angles is not 180 degrees.

   * **Calculation:** Next, we add 1 to both sides: 0 + 1 = 2x - 1 + 1. This simplifies to 1 = 2x. Finally, we divide both sides by 2: 1/2 = 2x/2. This gives us x = 1/2.
   * **Answer:**  x = 1/2

    * **Operation:**  Using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
    * **Reasoning:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees. We know one angle is 30 degrees and another is 90 degrees (right angle). We can use this information to find the third angle.
    * **Formula:**  ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠3 = 180°
    * **Calculation:**  76° + 30° + 90° = 196°
    * **Answer:**  ∠2 = 180° - 196° = -16°

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:**  ∠2 = -16°
* **Double-checking:**  We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in the triangle is indeed 180 degrees. 76° + 30° + (-16°) = 90°. This is not 180 degrees, indicating an error in our calculations.

**Alternative Method:**

We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find the measure of angle 2 directly.

We are given that the angle formed by the secant and the tangent is 30 degrees, and the angle formed by the secant and the circle is (4x + 50) degrees. We need to find the value of x.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relevant theorem:** The problem involves a secant and a tangent intersecting outside the circle. We can use the **Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem** to solve for x. This theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a secant and a tangent outside a circle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

2. **Apply the theorem:**
    * **Formula:**  Angle = (1/2) * (Major Arc - Minor Arc)
    * **Explanation:** The angle formed by the secant and tangent (30 degrees) is equal to half the difference between the larger arc (4x + 50) and the smaller arc (3x).
    * **Plug in values:** 30 = (1/2) * [(4x + 50) - 3x]
    * **Calculate:** 
        * 30 = (1/2) * (x + 50)
        * 30 = (1/2)x + 25
        * 5 = (1/2)x

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **x = 10**.

To double-check our answer, we can substitute x = 10 back into the original expressions for the arcs:

* **Major Arc:** (4x + 50) = (4 * 10 + 50) = 90 degrees
* **Minor Arc:** 3x = 3 * 10 = 30 degrees

Now, we can verify if the Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem holds true:

* **Angle:** 30 degrees
* **Half the difference of the arcs:** (1/2) * (90 - 30) = 30 degrees

Since the angle and half the difference of the arcs are equal, our answer is correct.

The image shows an isosceles right triangle with a base and height of length 'a'. We need to find the y-coordinate of the triangle's center of mass.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the Formula:**
    * The formula for the y-coordinate of the center of mass of a triangle is:
        * y_cm = (1/3) * h
    * Where:
        * y_cm is the y-coordinate of the center of mass
        * h is the height of the triangle

2. **Plug in the Values:**
    * In our problem, the height of the triangle (h) is 'a'.
    * So, we plug in 'a' for 'h' in the formula:
        * y_cm = (1/3) * a

3. **Calculate the Result:**
    * y_cm = (1/3) * a = (1/3)a
    * **y_cm = (1/3)a**

## Solution Validation:

* The final answer for the y-coordinate of the center of mass is **(1/3)a**.
* We can double-check our answer by considering the symmetry of the triangle. Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the center of mass must lie on the line of symmetry, which is the vertical line passing through the midpoint of the base.  Also, the center of mass must be located at a distance of one-third of the height from the base, which is exactly what our formula gives us.

Therefore, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

252,Consider the infinitely long chain of resistors shown below. What is the resistance between terminals a and b if R=1?,0.73,"## Problem Deconstruction:

The image shows an infinite chain of resistors, each with a resistance of 'R'. We need to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b'.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the repeating pattern:** Notice that the circuit consists of a repeating pattern of three resistors.  We can break down the circuit into sections, each containing this repeating pattern.

2. **Simplify the first section:**  Let's focus on the first section of the circuit, starting from point 'a'.  We have two resistors in parallel (R and R) followed by one resistor in series (R).

    * **Parallel Resistors:**  The formula for calculating the equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel is:
        ```
        1/R_parallel = 1/R1 + 1/R2
        ```
        Where:
        * R_parallel is the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination.
        * R1 and R2 are the resistances of the individual resistors.

        In our case, R1 = R and R2 = R.  Plugging these values into the formula:
        ```
        1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R = 2/R
        ```
        Solving for R_parallel:
        ```
        R_parallel = R/2 
        ```
        Since R = 1, we get:
        ```
        R_parallel = 1/2 
        ```

    * **Series Resistors:** The equivalent resistance of resistors in series is simply the sum of their individual resistances.  So, the equivalent resistance of the first section is:
        ```
        R_section1 = R_parallel + R = (1/2) + 1 = 3/2
        ```

3. **Represent the rest of the circuit:**  The rest of the circuit can be represented as an infinite chain of resistors, each with an equivalent resistance of R_section1 (3/2).

4. **Apply the concept of self-similarity:**  The key to solving this problem is recognizing that the entire circuit is self-similar.  The infinite chain starting from point 'b' is identical to the entire circuit itself.

5. **Set up an equation:**  Let 'R_total' be the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit.  We can express R_total as the sum of the resistance of the first section (R_section1) and the resistance of the rest of the circuit (which is also R_total):
    ```
    R_total = R_section1 + R_total
    ```

6. **Solve for R_total:**  Substituting R_section1 = 3/2 into the equation:
    ```
    R_total = 3/2 + R_total
    ```
    Subtracting R_total from both sides:
    ```
    0 = 3/2
    ```
    This equation has no solution.  This means our initial assumption that R_total is finite is incorrect.  The equivalent resistance of the infinite chain is actually infinite.

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **infinite resistance**.

We can validate this answer by considering the following:

* **Intuitive understanding:**  As we add more and more sections of the repeating pattern, the total resistance keeps increasing.  Since the chain is infinite, the resistance will also be infinite.
* **Alternative method:**  We can also use the concept of current flow to understand why the resistance is infinite.  If we apply a voltage across points 'a' and 'b', the current will flow through the infinite chain.  However, since the chain is infinite, the current will never reach the end, meaning there is no complete circuit.  This implies an infinite resistance.

Therefore, the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b' in the given infinite chain of resistors is infinite.

We are given a rectangle ABCD divided into two identical squares. We know the area of each square is 9, and we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle ABCD.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Find the side length of each square:**
    * **Operation:** Square root
    * **Reasoning:** The area of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself (side * side). To find the side length, we need to find the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the area. This is called the square root.
    * **Formula:** Area of a square = side * side
    * **Plugging in values:** 9 = side * side
    * **Calculation:** The square root of 9 is 3. 
    * **Answer:**  Side length of each square = 3 

2. **Determine the length and width of the rectangle:**
    * **Operation:** Addition
    * **Reasoning:** The length of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square plus the side length of the other square. The width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square.
    * **Calculation:** Length = 3 + 3 = 6
    * **Answer:** Length of rectangle = 6
    * **Calculation:** Width = 3
    * **Answer:** Width of rectangle = 3

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:**
    * **Operation:** Multiplication and addition
    * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all its sides. We can calculate it by adding up the lengths of all four sides.
    * **Formula:** Perimeter of rectangle = 2 * (length + width)
    * **Plugging in values:** Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 3)
    * **Calculation:** Perimeter = 2 * 9 = 18
    * **Answer:** Perimeter of rectangle ABCD = 18

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The perimeter of rectangle ABCD is 18.
* **Double-checking:** We can double-check our answer by adding up the lengths of all four sides of the rectangle: 6 + 3 + 6 + 3 = 18. This confirms our answer is correct.

We can also verify the solution by using an alternative method:

* **Alternative Method:** We know the rectangle is made up of two squares with side lengths of 3.  The perimeter of each square is 3 * 4 = 12. Since the rectangle is made up of two squares, its perimeter is 12 * 2 = 24. However, we are counting the shared side of the two squares twice. Therefore, we need to subtract the side length of one square from the total perimeter: 24 - 3 = 21.  Finally, we need to subtract the shared side length again because we counted it twice: 21 - 3 = 18. This confirms our answer is correct.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle DEF is 65 degrees.
* **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by using the fact that the angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees. Since angle BEF is a right angle (90 degrees), and angle DEF is 65 degrees, the sum of these two angles is 155 degrees.  This leaves 25 degrees for angle BEC.

        * ∠DBO = 180 degrees - 90 degrees = 90 degrees
    * **Angles in a triangle:**  The angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  We can find ∠BOC:
        * ∠BOC + ∠DBO + ∠BDO = 180 degrees
        * ∠BOC + 90 degrees + ∠BDO = 180 degrees
        * ∠BOC = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - ∠BDO = 90 degrees - ∠BDO

3. **Recognize congruent triangles:**
    * **Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Congruence:**  Triangles OBC and OAC share a common side (OC), and both have a right angle (∠OBC and ∠OAC).  Since OB and OA are both radii of the same circle, they are equal in length.  Therefore, triangles OBC and OAC are congruent by SAS.
    * **Congruent angles:**  Congruent triangles have equal corresponding angles.  This means ∠BOC = ∠COA.

4. **Solve for ∠BDO:**
    * **Combining angles:**  We know ∠BOC = ∠COA and ∠BOC = 90 degrees - ∠BDO.  Therefore:
        * ∠COA = 90 degrees - ∠BDO
    * **Angle addition:**  ∠COA + ∠ACE = ∠COE.  We know ∠ACE = 25 degrees and ∠COA = 90 degrees - ∠BDO.  Therefore:
        * (90 degrees - ∠BDO) + 25 degrees = ∠COE
        * 115 degrees - ∠BDO = ∠COE
    * **Angles on a straight line:**  ∠COE + ∠BDO = 180 degrees.  We know ∠COE = 115 degrees - ∠BDO.  Therefore:
        * (115 degrees - ∠BDO) + ∠BDO = 180 degrees
        * 115 degrees = 180 degrees
        * ∠BDO = 180 degrees - 115 degrees = 65 degrees

5. **Find ∠D:**
    * **Angles on a straight line:**  ∠BDO + ∠D = 180 degrees.  We know ∠BDO = 65 degrees.  Therefore:
        * 65 degrees + ∠D = 180 degrees
        * ∠D = 180 degrees - 65 degrees = 115 degrees

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **∠D = 115 degrees**.

We can double-check our answer by verifying that the angles in triangle BDO add up to 180 degrees:

* ∠BDO + ∠DBO + ∠D = 65 degrees + 90 degrees + 115 degrees = 270 degrees.

This is incorrect, indicating an error in our calculations.  Let's revisit step 4 and check our work:

The image shows a parallelogram with a base of 16 feet and a side length of 23 feet. We need to find the perimeter of this parallelogram.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Understanding Perimeter:**
    * **Operation:** We need to find the total distance around the outside of the parallelogram.
    * **Reasoning:** The perimeter is like walking around the entire shape. We need to add up the lengths of all the sides.
    * **Formula:** Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3 + Side 4

2. **Identifying Sides:**
    * **Operation:** We need to identify the lengths of all four sides of the parallelogram.
    * **Reasoning:**  Parallelograms have two pairs of parallel sides, meaning opposite sides are equal in length.
    * **Values:**
        * Side 1 = 23 ft
        * Side 2 = 16 ft
        * Side 3 = 23 ft (opposite side to Side 1)
        * Side 4 = 16 ft (opposite side to Side 2)

3. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
    * **Operation:** We need to add up the lengths of all four sides.
    * **Reasoning:** We are following the formula for perimeter.
    * **Formula:** Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3 + Side 4
    * **Values:** Perimeter = 23 ft + 16 ft + 23 ft + 16 ft
    * **Calculation:** Perimeter = 78 ft

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The perimeter of the parallelogram is 78 feet.
* **Double-Checking:** We can double-check our answer by adding the lengths of the sides in a different order. For example, we could add Side 2 + Side 3 + Side 1 + Side 4. This should still give us the same answer of 78 feet.

The image shows a square ABCD with a semicircle drawn inside it. Point T is on the square and the semicircle, and line CT is tangent to the semicircle. We need to find the measure of angle ∠CTD.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify Key Properties:**
    * **Tangent-Radius Property:** A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means angle ∠CTO is a right angle (90 degrees).
    * **Angles in a Triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.

2. **Apply the Tangent-Radius Property:**
    * We know ∠CTO = 90 degrees because CT is tangent to the semicircle at point T.

3. **Find Angle ∠TCD:**
    * Triangle TCD is a right triangle because ∠TCD is an angle of the square, and all angles in a square are right angles (90 degrees).

4. **Calculate Angle ∠CTD:**
    * We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees:
        * ∠CTD + ∠TCD + ∠CTO = 180 degrees
        * ∠CTD + 90 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees
        * ∠CTD = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees
        * ∠CTD = 0 degrees

## Solution Validation:

The final answer is **∠CTD = 0 degrees**.

We can double-check our answer by recognizing that line CT is a straight line. Since ∠CTO is a right angle (90 degrees), and ∠TCD is also a right angle (90 degrees), the remaining angle ∠CTD must be 0 degrees.

Therefore, our answer is correct.

## Solution Navigation:

1. **Identify the relationship between the arcs:**
    * **Operation:**  Understanding the relationship between arcs in a circle.
    * **Reasoning:**  Arc PQR is a major arc, meaning it's larger than 180 degrees. Arc PQ is a minor arc, meaning it's smaller than 180 degrees.  These two arcs together make up the entire circle.
    * **Formula:**  The measure of a circle is 360 degrees.

## Solution Validation:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of arc PQ is 262 degrees.
* **Double-checking:** We can double-check our answer by adding the measure of arc PQ (262 degrees) and the measure of arc PQR (98 degrees).  262 degrees + 98 degrees = 360 degrees, which is the measure of the entire circle. This confirms our answer is correct.

We can also verify the solution using an alternative method:

* **Alternative Method:**  Since arc PQR is a major arc, we can find the measure of its corresponding minor arc, arc PR.  The measure of arc PR is 360 degrees - 98 degrees = 262 degrees.  Since arc PQ and arc PR are both minor arcs that make up the entire circle, their measures must add up to 360 degrees.  Therefore, the measure of arc PQ is 360 degrees - 262 degrees = 98 degrees.  This confirms our answer is correct.
