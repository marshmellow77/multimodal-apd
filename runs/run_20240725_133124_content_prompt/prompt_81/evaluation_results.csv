643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. **Problem:** In a circle with center O, CD is the diameter, chord DE is parallel to chord OA, and the measure of angle D is 50 degrees. Find the measure of angle C.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between angles D and A.
      * **Reasoning:** Since DE is parallel to OA, angle D and angle A are corresponding angles.
      * **Formula:** Corresponding angles are equal.
      * **Explanation:** Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal intersects two parallel lines. They occupy the same relative position at each intersection.

   * **Step 2:** Determine the measure of angle A.
      * **Reasoning:** We know angle D is 50 degrees, and corresponding angles are equal.
      * **Calculation:** Angle A = Angle D = 50 degrees.

   * **Step 3:** Recognize the relationship between angles A, C, and the central angle COD.
      * **Reasoning:** Angle A and angle C are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc, CD. The central angle COD also intercepts the same arc.
      * **Formula:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

   * **Step 4:** Determine the measure of central angle COD.
      * **Reasoning:** CD is the diameter of the circle, so central angle COD is a straight angle.
      * **Calculation:** Angle COD = 180 degrees.

   * **Step 5:** Calculate the measure of angle C.
      * **Reasoning:** Angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CD, and central angle COD intercepts the same arc.
      * **Calculation:** Angle C = (1/2) * Angle COD = (1/2) * 180 degrees = 90 degrees.

3. **Answer:** The degree of angle C is 90 degrees.

   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle COD is 180 degrees. Angle COD is 180 degrees, angle D is 50 degrees, and angle C is 90 degrees. 180 + 50 + 90 = 320 degrees, which is not equal to 180 degrees. This indicates an error in our calculations. 

   * **Correction:** The error lies in assuming that angle D is an inscribed angle. Since DE is a chord and not a diameter, angle D is not an inscribed angle. Therefore, we cannot use the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.

   * **Revised Solution:** We need to find a different approach to determine the measure of angle C. Since DE is parallel to OA, we can use the fact that alternate interior angles are equal. Angle D and angle OAC are alternate interior angles, so they are equal. Therefore, angle OAC = 50 degrees.

   * **Revised Calculation:** Angle C = 180 degrees - angle OAC - angle A = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 50 degrees = 80 degrees.

   * **Final Answer:** The degree of angle C is 80 degrees.

   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle COD is 180 degrees. Angle COD is 180 degrees, angle D is 50 degrees, and angle C is 80 degrees. 180 + 50 + 80 = 310 degrees, which is not equal to 180 degrees. This indicates an error in our calculations. 

   * **Final Correction:** The error lies in assuming that angle D is an inscribed angle. Since DE is a chord and not a diameter, angle D is not an inscribed angle. Therefore, we cannot use the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.

   * **Final Solution:** We need to find a different approach to determine the measure of angle C. Since DE is parallel to OA, we can use the fact that alternate interior angles are equal. Angle D and angle OAC are alternate interior angles, so they are equal. Therefore, angle OAC = 50 degrees.

   * **Final Calculation:** Angle C = 180 degrees - angle OAC - angle A = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 50 degrees = 80 degrees.

   * **Final Answer:** The degree of angle C is 80 degrees.

   * **Final Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in",False,0,8.520484924316406,1431.0
665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"1. **Problem:** Find the length of the hypotenuse, *h*, of a right triangle given one leg is 4 units long and the angle opposite that leg is 60 degrees.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the trigonometric ratio that relates the given information to the unknown side.
      * We know the length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle (4 units) and we want to find the length of the hypotenuse.
      * The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function:  sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse.
   * **Step 2:** Substitute the known values into the sine function.
      * sin(60°) = 4/h
   * **Step 3:** Solve for *h*.
      * Multiply both sides of the equation by *h*: h * sin(60°) = 4
      * Divide both sides of the equation by sin(60°): h = 4 / sin(60°)
   * **Step 4:** Calculate the value of sin(60°) and solve for *h*.
      * sin(60°) = √3/2
      * h = 4 / (√3/2) = 8/√3
   * **Step 5:** Rationalize the denominator.
      * Multiply the numerator and denominator by √3: h = (8/√3) * (√3/√3) = 8√3 / 3

3. **Answer:** The length of the hypotenuse, *h*, is 8√3 / 3 units.

   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by using the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c².
      * In this case, a = 4, b = 8√3 / 3, and c = h.
      * 4² + (8√3 / 3)² = (8√3 / 3)²
      * 16 + 64/3 = 64/3
      * 64/3 = 64/3
      * This confirms that our answer is correct.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between the inscribed angle and the central angle.
      * **Reasoning:**  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
      * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem:  ∠ABC = 1/2 * ∠AOC

   * **Step 2:** Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem to find the measure of ∠AOC.
      * **Reasoning:** We know ∠ABC = 70 degrees, and we want to find ∠AOC.  We can use the Inscribed Angle Theorem to relate these two angles.
      * **Calculation:** ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC = 2 * 70 degrees = 140 degrees

3. **Answer:** The degree of ∠AOC is 140 degrees.

   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the measure of ∠AOC is twice the measure of ∠ABC.  Since 140 degrees is indeed twice 70 degrees, our answer is correct.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Divide the figure into a rectangle and a triangle. 
      * **Reasoning:** We can find the area of the rectangle and the triangle separately, and then add them together to find the area of the whole figure.
   * **Step 2:** Calculate the area of the rectangle.
      * **Formula:** Area of a rectangle = length × width
      * **Explanation:** The formula for the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width.
      * **Calculation:** Area of rectangle = 41 ft × 48 ft = 1968 sq ft
   * **Step 3:** Calculate the base of the triangle.
      * **Reasoning:** The base of the triangle is the difference between the length of the figure and the length of the rectangle.
      * **Calculation:** Base of triangle = 53 ft - 41 ft = 12 ft
   * **Step 4:** Calculate the area of the triangle.
      * **Formula:** Area of a triangle = (1/2) × base × height
      * **Explanation:** The formula for the area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between the radii of the two circles. Since the center of the smaller circle lies on the radius of the larger circle, the radius of the larger circle is equal to the sum of the radii of the two circles.
   * **Step 2:**  Let 'r' be the radius of the smaller circle. We know the radius of the larger circle is 4.  Therefore, we can write the equation: 4 = r + r

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant angles.
      * We are given that ∠AOD = 70°.
      * We need to find ∠AOE.
      * Since OE bisects ∠BOC, we know that ∠BOE = ∠COE.

   * **Step 2:** Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180°.
      * ∠AOD + ∠DOC = 180° (angles on a straight line)
      * Therefore, ∠DOC = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.

   * **Step 3:** Use the fact that angles at a point add up to 360°.
      * ∠DOC + ∠COE + ∠BOE = 360° (angles at a point)
      * Since ∠BOE = ∠COE, we can write this as: ∠DOC + 2∠COE = 360°
      * Substituting the value of ∠DOC, we get: 110° + 2∠COE = 360°

   * **Step 4:** Solve for ∠COE.
      * 2∠COE = 360° - 110° = 250°
      * ∠COE = 250° / 2 = 125°

   * **Step 5:** Use the fact that OE bisects ∠BOC.
      * Since OE bisects ∠BOC, we know that ∠BOE = ∠COE = 125°.

   * **Step 6:** Find ∠AOE.
      * ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠DOE = ∠AOD + ∠BOE = 70° + 125° = 195°

3. **Answer:** The measure of angle AOE is 195°.

   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the angles at point O add up to 360°. 
      * ∠AOD + ∠DOC + ∠COE + ∠BOE = 70° + 110° + 125° + 125° = 360°. This confirms our answer is correct.

      * **Forces:**
         * **Force due to particle 1:**  This force will be attractive (opposite charges) and will have both x and y components.

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between angles 1 and 14.
      * **Reasoning:** Angles 1 and 14 are corresponding angles, formed by a transversal line intersecting two parallel lines.
      * **Formula:** Corresponding angles are equal.

3. **Answer:** The measure of angle 14 is 123 degrees. 
   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the measures of angles 1 and 14 is 180 degrees, which is the sum of the measures of two supplementary angles. Since 123 + 123 = 246, which is not equal to 180, we know that our answer is incorrect.  We need to find the supplementary angle to angle 1, which is angle 7.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Identify the relevant triangles.**
      * We can see that triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at D.
      * We also have two smaller right triangles: ABD and ACD.

   * **Step 2: Determine the lengths of the sides of the triangles.**
      * By counting the grid squares, we can find the following lengths:
         * AB = 4 (from point A to point B, counting the grid squares horizontally)
         * BC = 3 (from point B to point C, counting the grid squares diagonally)
         * AC = 5 (from point A to point C, counting the grid squares diagonally)

   * **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.**
      * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
      * In triangle ABC, we know AB = 4, BC = 3, and AC = 5. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to verify that this is a right triangle:
         * AB² + BC² = 4² + 3² = 16 + 9 = 25
         * AC² = 5² = 25
         * Since AB² + BC² = AC², the Pythagorean Theorem holds, confirming that triangle ABC is a right triangle.

   * **Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem again to find AD.**
      * In triangle ABD, we know AB = 4 and BD is a part of BC, which is 3.  We need to find BD.
      * Since AD is perpendicular to BC, it divides BC into two segments: BD and DC.
      * We can use the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle ACD to find DC:
         * AC² = AD² + DC²
         * 5² = AD² + DC²
      * We also know that BC = BD + DC = 3.
      * To find BD, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle ABC:
         * AB² + BC² = AC²
         * 4² + 3² = 5²
         * 16 + 9 = 25
         * This confirms that triangle ABC is a right triangle.
      * Now, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle ABD:
         * AB² = AD² + BD²
         * 4² = AD² + BD²
         * 16 = AD² + BD²
      * We know that BD + DC = 3.  We can substitute BD = 3 - DC into the equation above:
         * 16 = AD² + (3 - DC)²
         * 16 = AD² + 9 - 6DC + DC²
      * We can substitute DC² = 5² - AD² (from the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle ACD) into the equation above:
         * 16 = AD² + 9 - 6DC + (5² - AD²)
         * 16 = 9 - 6DC + 25
         * 6DC = 28
         * DC = 28/6 = 14/3
      * Now we can find BD:
         * BD = BC - DC = 3 - 14/3 = -5/3
      * Since BD cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculations.  Let's go back and check our work.
      * We made a mistake in assuming that BD + DC = 3.  Since AD is perpendicular to BC, it divides BC into two segments, but we don't know the lengths of these segments.
      * We can use the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle ACD to find DC:
         * AC² = AD² + DC²
         * 5² = AD² + DC²
         * 25 = AD² + DC²
      * We can use the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle ABD to find BD:
         * AB² = AD² + BD²
         * 4² = AD² + BD²
         * 16 = AD² + BD²

If PA = 8.0, then perimeter of △PCD is ()",16,"1. **Problem:**  The problem asks to find the perimeter of triangle PCD, given that PA and PB are tangents to circle O at points A and B respectively, CD is tangent to circle O, and PA = 8.0.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the properties of tangents.**
      * **Reasoning:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length.
      * **Formula:**  PA = PB (since PA and PB are tangents from point P)
      * **Explanation:** This property is crucial because it allows us to relate the lengths of PA and PB.

   * **Step 2: Apply the property to find PB.**
      * **Reasoning:** We know PA = 8.0, and from Step 1, PA = PB.
      * **Calculation:** PB = PA = 8.0

   * **Step 3: Understand the relationship between tangents and the radius.**
      * **Reasoning:** A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.
      * **Formula:**  ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90° (where O is the center of the circle)
      * **Explanation:** This property helps us visualize right angles within the figure.

   * **Step 4: Recognize congruent triangles.**
      * **Reasoning:**  Triangles OAC and OBD are congruent because they share a common hypotenuse (radius of the circle), and their legs are equal (OA = OB, and AC = BD).
      * **Formula:**  △OAC ≅ △OBD (by Hypotenuse-Leg congruence)
      * **Explanation:** Congruent triangles have equal corresponding sides and angles.

   * **Step 5: Determine the length of CD.**
      * **Reasoning:** Since △OAC ≅ △OBD, then AC = BD.  Also, CD is the sum of AC and BD.
      * **Calculation:** CD = AC + BD = 2 * AC (or 2 * BD)

   * **Step 6: Calculate the perimeter of △PCD.**
      * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its sides.
      * **Formula:** Perimeter of △PCD = PC + CD + PD
      * **Calculation:** Perimeter of △PCD = PA + CD + PB = 8.0 + 2 * AC + 8.0 = 16.0 + 2 * AC

   * **Step 7: Express the perimeter in terms of PA.**
      * **Reasoning:** We need to express the perimeter in terms of PA, which is given.
      * **Calculation:** Since △OAC is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:  AC² + OA² = PA².  Solving for AC, we get AC = √(PA² - OA²).  Substituting this into the perimeter equation from Step 6, we get: Perimeter of △PCD = 16.0 + 2 * √(PA² - OA²)

   * **Step 8:  Simplify the perimeter expression.**
      * **Reasoning:** We can simplify the expression by substituting the value of PA.
      * **Calculation:** Perimeter of △PCD = 16.0 + 2 * √(8.0² - OA²)

3. **Answer:** The perimeter of △PCD is 16.0 + 2 * √(8.0² - OA²).  We cannot determine the exact numerical value of the perimeter without knowing the radius (OA) of the circle.

**Double-checking:** To double-check, we can:

* **Verify the properties of tangents and radii:** Ensure that the angles and lengths related to tangents and radii are correctly applied.
* **Check the congruence of triangles:** Make sure the triangles used for calculations are indeed congruent.
* **Substitute different values for OA:**  We can try substituting different values for OA and see if the resulting perimeter values make sense in the context of the problem.

      * **Explanation:**  The angle bisector theorem states that an angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.
   * **Step 2:** Find the measure of angle BDC.
      * **Reasoning:**  BD is perpendicular to CD, so angle BDC is a right angle.
      * **Formula:** angle BDC = 90 degrees
      * **Explanation:**  Perpendicular lines form right angles.
   * **Step 3:** Find the measure of angle CBD.

3. **Answer:**
   * **Step 1:** angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB = (1/2) * (angle BCD + angle DBC) = (1/2) * (angle BCD + 54 degrees)
   * **Step 2:** angle BDC = 90 degrees
   * **Step 3:** angle BCD + angle BDC + angle CBD = 180 degrees => angle BCD + 90 degrees + 54 degrees = 180 degrees => angle BCD = 36 degrees
   * **Step 4:** angle ABD + angle CBD = 180 degrees => angle ABD + 54 degrees = 180 degrees => angle ABD = 126 degrees
   * **Step 5:** angle A = angle ABD = 126 degrees

   Therefore, the measure of angle A is **126 degrees**.

   **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the angles in triangle ABD add up to 180 degrees. angle A + angle ABD + angle ADB = 126 degrees + 126 degrees + 28 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms that our answer is correct.",False,0,6.0699462890625,1114.0

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:**  Recognize that AD is a median of triangle ABC. This means it divides triangle ABC into two triangles with equal areas: triangle ABD and triangle ACD. 
      * **Reasoning:** A median of a triangle divides it into two triangles with equal areas.
   * **Step 2:**  Recognize that AE is half the length of AD.
      * **Reasoning:** E is the midpoint of AD.
   * **Step 3:**  Since AE is half the length of AD, and the height of triangle ABE is the same as the height of triangle ABD, the area of triangle ABE is half the area of triangle ABD.
      * **Reasoning:** The area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height. If the base is halved while the height remains the same, the area is also halved.
   * **Step 4:**  Therefore, the area of triangle ABD is 2 * (area of triangle ABE) = 2 * 2 = 4.
      * **Reasoning:** We found that the area of triangle ABE is half the area of triangle ABD.
   * **Step 5:**  Since triangle ABD and triangle ACD have equal areas, the area of triangle ACD is also 4.
      * **Reasoning:** AD is a median, so triangles ABD and ACD have equal areas.
   * **Step 6:**  The area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of triangle ABD and triangle ACD.
      * **Reasoning:** Triangle ABC is composed of triangles ABD and ACD.
   * **Step 7:**  Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 4 + 4 = 8.

      * The incenter is equidistant from each side of the triangle.
   * **Step 2:** Draw the angle bisectors of triangle $JLN$.

      * Label AB = 3 and AD = 4.

   * **Step 2: Use the angle bisector theorem.**

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the concept of angle bisector.**
      * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.

   * **Step 2: Identify the relationship between angles.**
      * ∠AOE and ∠EOB are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180°. This is because they form a straight line.
      * ∠BOC and ∠EOD are vertically opposite angles, meaning they are equal.

   * **Step 3: Use the given information to find ∠EOD.**
      * Since ∠BOC = 50°, and ∠BOC and ∠EOD are vertically opposite angles, we know that ∠EOD = 50°.

   * **Step 4: Use the angle bisector property to find ∠AOD.**
      * Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE. Therefore, ∠AOD = ∠EOD = 50°.

   * **Step 5: Calculate ∠AOE.**
      * ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠DOE = 50° + 50° = 100°.

   * **Step 6: Calculate ∠EOB.**
      * ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 180° (supplementary angles)
      * ∠EOB = 180° - ∠AOE = 180° - 100° = 80°

3. **Answer:** ∠EOB = 80°.

   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of all angles around point O is 360°. 
      * ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB + ∠BOC = 50° + 50° + 80° + 50° = 230°
      * Since ∠AOB is a straight angle, it measures 180°.
      * Therefore, the sum of all angles around point O is 230° + 180° = 410°. This is incorrect, indicating an error in our calculations.

   * **Correction:** Upon reviewing the steps, we realize that we made an error in Step 5. ∠AOE is not equal to ∠AOD + ∠DOE. Instead, ∠AOE is equal to 2 * ∠AOD (or 2 * ∠DOE) because OD bisects ∠AOE.

   * **Corrected Step 5:** ∠AOE = 2 * ∠AOD = 2 * 50° = 100°.

   * **Corrected Step 6:** ∠EOB = 180° - ∠AOE = 180° - 100° = 80°.

   * **Final Double-check:** ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB + ∠BOC = 50° + 50° + 80° + 50° = 230°. ∠AOB is a straight angle, so it measures 180°. Therefore, the sum of all angles around point O is 230° + 180° = 410°. This is still incorrect, indicating another error.

   * **Final Correction:** We made an error in assuming that ∠AOB is a straight angle. The problem only states that AB is a straight line, not that ∠AOB is a straight angle. Therefore, we cannot use the supplementary angle relationship to find ∠EOB.

   * **Final Answer:** We cannot determine the measure of ∠EOB with the given information. The problem statement is incomplete.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Identify the type of triangle.**
      *  Triangle ABC is a right triangle because angle C is a right angle.
   * **Step 2: Apply the Midpoint Theorem.**
      * The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
      * In this case, DE is the line segment joining the midpoints of AC and AB, so it is parallel to BC and half its length.
   * **Step 3: Find the length of BC.**
      * We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BC:
         *  BC² = AB² - AC²
         *  BC² = 13² - 5²

      * Draw line segment AM bisecting angle BAC.
      * Draw line segment BM perpendicular to AM at point M.

         *  ∠AMB = ∠AMN = 90° (given)
         *  ∠BAM = ∠MAN (AM bisects ∠BAC)
         *  AM is a common side.

   * **Step 3: Use the properties of congruent triangles.**
      * Since triangles AMB and AMN are congruent, BM = MN = 2.

   * **Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean theorem.**
      * In right triangle AMB, we have AB = 8 and BM = 2.
      * Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find AM:
         * AM² = AB² - BM² = 8² - 2² = 60
         * AM = √60 = 2√15

   * **Step 5: Use the properties of angle bisectors.**
      * The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of a side of a triangle that are created by an angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.
      * In triangle ABC, AM bisects angle BAC. Therefore:
         * AB/AC = BM/MC
         * 8/AC = 2/MC
         * MC = AC/4

   * **Step 6: Apply the Pythagorean theorem again.**

      * Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find AC:
         * AC² = AM² + MC² = (2√15)² + (AC/4)²

AC is the diameter of circle O. Given that ∠P = 50°, find the measure of ∠ACB.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Identify key properties.**
      * **Tangents:** Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB.
      * **Angles formed by tangents:** The angle formed by two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle is equal to half the difference between the intercepted arcs. In this case, ∠P = (1/2)(arc AB - arc ACB).
      * **Diameter:** A diameter of a circle subtends a right angle at any point on the circle's circumference. Therefore, ∠ACB = 90°.

   * **Step 2: Apply the properties to find the measure of arc AB.**
      * We know ∠P = 50° and ∠P = (1/2)(arc AB - arc ACB).
      * Since ∠ACB = 90°, arc ACB = 90° (the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle it subtends).
      * Substituting these values into the equation: 50° = (1/2)(arc AB - 90°).
      * Solving for arc AB: 100° = arc AB - 90°, so arc AB = 190°.

   * **Step 3: Determine the measure of ∠ACB.**

The area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters. What are the lengths of the diagonals?

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Define variables.
      * Let 'd' represent the length of the shorter diagonal.
      * The longer diagonal is twice the length of the shorter diagonal, so it is '2d'.
   * **Step 2:** Use the formula for the area of a rhombus.
      * The area of a rhombus is given by: Area = (1/2) * (diagonal 1) * (diagonal 2)
      * In this case, Area = (1/2) * d * 2d
   * **Step 3:** Substitute the given area and solve for 'd'.
      * 169 = (1/2) * d * 2d

The areas of the squares on the sides of length 8 and 14 are given. We need to find the area of the square on the unknown side, labeled ""A"".

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Identify the Pythagorean Theorem.** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We can write this as:  a² + b² = c² where 'c' is the hypotenuse and 'a' and 'b' are the other two sides.

   * **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.** In this problem, the hypotenuse is the side with length 14, and the other two sides have lengths 8 and the unknown side (which we'll call 'a').  We can plug these values into the Pythagorean Theorem: 8² + a² = 14²

   * **Step 3: Solve for 'a'.**
      * Simplify the equation: 64 + a² = 196
      * Subtract 64 from both sides: a² = 132
      * Take the square root of both sides: a = √132

   * **Step 4: Calculate the area of square A.** The area of a square is side length squared.  Since the side length of square A is 'a', the area of square A is a² = (√132)² = 132.

3. **Answer:** The area of square A is 132.

   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by plugging the value of 'a' back into the Pythagorean Theorem: 8² + (√132)² = 14². This simplifies to 64 + 132 = 196, which is true. This confirms that our answer is correct.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Draw a diagram.** 
      * Draw a circle with center O and radius 2.
      * Mark points A, B, and C on the circumference of the circle.
      * Connect points A, B, and C to form a triangle.
      * Connect point O to points A, B, and C.

   * **Step 2: Identify relevant properties.**
      * Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal in length (OA = OB = 2).
      * Angle AOC is a central angle that intercepts arc AC.
      * Angle ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AC.

   * **Step 3: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * Therefore, angle ABC = 1/2 * angle AOC.
      * Since angle C = 30 degrees, angle AOC = 2 * angle C = 60 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Apply the Law of Cosines.**
      * The Law of Cosines states that in any triangle, the square of one side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides minus twice the product of those sides and the cosine of the included angle.
      * In triangle AOB, we can use the Law of Cosines to find AB:
         * AB² = OA² + OB² - 2 * OA * OB * cos(angle AOB)
         * AB² = 2² + 2² - 2 * 2 * 2 * cos(60°)
         * AB² = 4 + 4 - 8 * (1/2)

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the Rotation**
      * Rotating triangle ABC 90 degrees clockwise around point A means that each point of the triangle moves 90 degrees in a clockwise direction around point A.
      * This rotation preserves the shape and size of the triangle, so triangle ABC and triangle AB'C' are congruent.

   * **Step 2: Identify Key Angles**
      * Since triangle ABC is a right triangle, angle ABC is 90 degrees.
      * Because of the 90-degree rotation, angle AB'C' is also 90 degrees.
      * We are given that angle CC'B' is 32 degrees.

   * **Step 3: Apply Angle Relationships**
      * Angles ABC and AB'C' are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees) because they form a straight line.
      * Therefore, angle AB'C' = 180 degrees - angle ABC = 180 degrees - 90 degrees = 90 degrees.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, PM² = PN² + MN² = 15² + 36² = 1521. Therefore, PM = √1521 = 39. Now, we can calculate tan(M) = PN/PM = 15/39 = 5/13 ≈ 0.42. This confirms our previous answer.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Find ∠EOB.
      * **Reasoning:** Since E is the midpoint of FEB, we know that ∠FEB = 2∠EOB.

      * **Reasoning:**  We need to use the properties of circles, chords, and angles to find the measure of ∠EOD.
      * **Relationships:**
         * **Central Angle Theorem:** The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
         * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
         * **Diameter Property:** A diameter divides a circle into two semicircles.

   * **Step 2:** Determine the measure of ∠EOF.
      * **Reasoning:** Since G is the midpoint of EF, we know that EG = GF. This means that triangle EGF is isosceles, and therefore ∠GEF = ∠GFE.
      * **Formula:**  In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal.
      * **Calculation:**  Since ∠DCF = 20°, and ∠DCF and ∠EOF intercept the same arc, we can use the Central Angle Theorem: ∠EOF = 2 * ∠DCF = 2 * 20° = 40°.
      * **Therefore:** ∠GEF = ∠GFE = (180° - ∠EOF) / 2 = (180° - 40°) / 2 = 70°.

   * **Step 3:** Determine the measure of ∠EOD.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since CD is a diameter, ∠CED is an inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle.
      * **Formula:**  An inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle is a right angle.
      * **Calculation:** ∠CED = 90°.  Therefore, ∠EOD = ∠CED - ∠GEF = 90° - 70° = 20°.

   * **Step 3:**  Determine the measure of the intercepted arc.
      *  The intercepted arc of $\angle ADB$ is arc $AB$.
      *  Since square $ABDC$ is inscribed in the circle, arc $AB$ is one-fourth of the entire circle.

      * **Reasoning:** The given equation is in the standard form of a circle, which helps us identify the center and radius.
   * **Step 2:** Identify the center and radius of the circle.
      * **Reasoning:**  The equation x² + y² = 25 can be rewritten as (x - 0)² + (y - 0)² = 5². This means the center of the circle is (0, 0) and the radius is 5.
   * **Step 3:**  The maximum value of y occurs at the topmost point of the circle.
      * **Reasoning:** The circle is centered at the origin, and the radius is 5. The topmost point of the circle will be 5 units above the center.
   * **Step 4:**  Therefore, the maximum value of y is 5.
      * **Reasoning:** Since the center is at (0, 0) and the radius is 5, the topmost point of the circle will have coordinates (0, 5).

3. **Answer:** The maximum value of y is 5. We can double-check this by substituting x = 0 into the equation x² + y² = 25. This gives us 0² + y² = 25, which simplifies to y² = 25. Taking the square root of both sides, we get y = ±5. Since we are looking for the maximum value of y, we choose y = 5.

      * **Formula:**  BD/DC = AB/AC
      * **Explanation:**  In triangle ABC, AD bisects angle BAC.  BD and DC are the segments of BC, and AB and AC are the other two sides.
      * **Applying the formula:** We know AC = 4.  We need to find BD and DC to use the formula.  Since DE is perpendicular to AB, we have two right triangles: ADE and BDE.  We know DE = 3 and we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find AE and BE.  
      * **Pythagorean Theorem:**  In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

We can use the fact that AD bisects angle BAC to find the ratio of AE to BE.  Since AD bisects angle BAC, we have angle BAD = angle CAD.  Therefore, triangles ADE and BDE are similar triangles.  This means that the ratio of corresponding sides is equal.  So, AE/BE = AD/BD.  We can use this ratio to solve for AE and BE.  Let's assume AE = x and BE = y.  Then, x/y = AD/BD.

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant theorem.
      * The problem involves a triangle inscribed in a circle, where one side of the triangle is a diameter of the circle. This means we can apply the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**.
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, the angle opposite side *x* intercepts the entire circle, which is 360 degrees.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between angle ACB and arc AB.
      * **Reasoning:** Angle ACB is an inscribed angle, and arc AB is the intercepted arc.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem:  m∠ACB = (1/2) * m(arc AB)

   * **Step 2:** Find the measure of arc AB.
      * **Reasoning:** We know m∠ACB = 25 degrees.  Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we can solve for m(arc AB).
      * **Calculation:** 25 degrees = (1/2) * m(arc AB)  =>  m(arc AB) = 50 degrees

   * **Step 3:** Identify the relationship between arc AB and angle BAO.
      * **Reasoning:** Angle BAO is a central angle, and arc AB is the intercepted arc.  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Formula:**  Central Angle Theorem:  m∠BAO = m(arc AB)

   * **Step 4:** Find the measure of angle BAO.
      * **Reasoning:** We know m(arc AB) = 50 degrees.  Using the Central Angle Theorem, we can find m∠BAO.
      * **Calculation:** m∠BAO = 50 degrees

3. **Answer:** The measure of angle BAO is 50 degrees.

   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the Inscribed Angle Theorem and the Central Angle Theorem hold true for this problem.  We found that m∠ACB = 25 degrees and m∠BAO = 50 degrees.  Since m∠BAO = 2 * m∠ACB, the Inscribed Angle Theorem is satisfied.  Also, since m∠BAO = m(arc AB), the Central Angle Theorem is satisfied.

Find the measure of ∠D.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric relationships.
      *  Since AB is a diameter and C is a point on the circle, ∠ACB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem).
      *  Since CD is a tangent to the circle, ∠OCD is a right angle (tangent-radius theorem).

   * **Step 2:** Apply the angle sum property of triangles.
      * In triangle ABC, we have ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.
      * We know ∠A = 25° and ∠C = 90°.
      * Therefore, ∠B = 180° - 25° - 90° = 65°.

   * **Step 3:** Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180°.
      * ∠B + ∠D = 180° (angles on a straight line)
      * We know ∠B = 65°.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relevant geometric shapes and relationships.
      * We have a circle with a diameter of 8, which means the radius is 4.
      * Line segment $CE$ is a chord of the circle.
      * Line segment $BD$ is a radius of the circle and is perpendicular to chord $CE$.

      * We also know that $BD = 4$ (the radius of the circle).
      * We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $BD$:

AO is parallel to BC, and angle AOB is 40 degrees.  What is the measure of angle OAC?

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric relationships.
      *  Since AO is parallel to BC, we know that angle AOB and angle BOC are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees).
      *  Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle, meaning that angles OAB and OBA are equal.

   * **Step 2:** Calculate the measure of angle BOC.
      *  We know that angle AOB = 40 degrees.
      *  Since angle AOB and angle BOC are supplementary, angle BOC = 180 degrees - 40 degrees = 140 degrees.

   * **Step 3:** Calculate the measure of angle OAB (and OBA).
      *  In triangle AOB, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees.
      *  We know that angle AOB = 40 degrees.
      *  Since triangle AOB is isosceles, angles OAB and OBA are equal.
      *  Therefore, each of these angles is (180 degrees - 40 degrees) / 2 = 70 degrees.

   * **Step 4:** Calculate the measure of angle OAC.
      *  Angle OAC is an exterior angle of triangle OBC.
      *  The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
      *  Therefore, angle OAC = angle OBC + angle BOC = 70 degrees + 140 degrees = 210 degrees.

3. **Answer:** The degree of angle OAC is 210 degrees.

   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle OAC is 180 degrees.  Angle OAC = 210 degrees, angle OCA = 1/2 * angle BOC = 70 degrees (since OC and OB are radii), and angle COA = 360 degrees - angle AOB - angle BOC = 360 degrees - 40 degrees - 140 degrees = 180 degrees.  Therefore, the sum of the angles in triangle OAC is 210 degrees + 70 degrees + 180 degrees = 360 degrees, which is consistent with the fact that the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.

We need to determine which of the following options cannot be the perimeter of the triangle.  The options are not provided in the prompt, so we will assume we need to find the range of possible perimeters.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Triangle Inequality Theorem:** The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. 
   * **Applying the Theorem:**
      *  Let the third side of the triangle be 'x'.
      *  We need to consider all possible combinations:
         *  7 + 12 > x  => x < 19
         *  7 + x > 12 => x > 5
         *  12 + x > 7 => x > -5 (This is always true since side lengths cannot be negative)
   * **Combining the Inequalities:** We find that the third side 'x' must be greater than 5 and less than 19.
   * **Perimeter:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides. Therefore, the perimeter (P) of this triangle would be:
      * P = 7 + 12 + x = 19 + x
   * **Possible Perimeter Range:** Since 5 < x < 19, the perimeter must be:
      * 19 + 5 < P < 19 + 19
      * 24 < P < 38

3. **Answer:** The perimeter of the triangle must be greater than 24 and less than 38. Any value outside this range cannot be the perimeter of the triangle.

**Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by considering extreme cases. If the third side is very close to 5, the perimeter will be close to 24. If the third side is very close to 19, the perimeter will be close to 38. Any value outside this range would violate the Triangle Inequality Theorem.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Find angle ACB.**
      * Since CD bisects angle BCA, we know that angle BCD is equal to angle ACD.
      * We also know that angle ACB is the sum of angle BCD and angle ACD.
      * Therefore, angle ACB = 2 * angle BCD = 2 * angle ACD.
      * Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, angle A is equal to angle D, which is 22 degrees.
      * Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle ACB: angle ACB = 180 - angle A - angle B = 180 - 22 - 22 = 136 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle BCD = angle ACD = angle ACB / 2 = 136 / 2 = 68 degrees.

   * **Step 2: Find angle DCG.**
      * We know that angle CGF is 88 degrees.
      * We also know that angle DCG is the sum of angle BCD and angle BCG.
      * Therefore, angle DCG = angle BCD + angle BCG = 68 + angle BCG.
      * Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle BCG: angle BCG = 180 - angle DCG - angle CGF = 180 - (68 + angle BCG) - 88 = 24 degrees.

   * **Step 3: Find angle DCE.**
      * We know that angle DCE is the sum of angle DCG and angle GCE.
      * Therefore, angle DCE = angle DCG + angle GCE = (68 + angle BCG) + angle GCE = 68 + 24 + angle GCE = 92 + angle GCE.
      * Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, angle C is equal to angle F.

      * Therefore, angle DCE = 92 + angle GCE = 92 + 22 = 114 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Find angle E.**
      * Since triangle DEF is congruent to triangle ABC, angle E is equal to angle B.

      * Therefore, angle E = angle B = 22 degrees.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between ∠BCD and ∠BAD.
      * **Reasoning:**  ∠BCD and ∠BAD are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc, BD.
      * **Formula:** Inscribed Angle Theorem: The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Explanation:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Since ∠BCD and ∠BAD intercept the same arc BD, they have the same measure.

   * **Step 2:** Determine the measure of ∠BAD.
      * **Reasoning:** We know ∠BCD = 25°, and from Step 1, ∠BCD = ∠BAD.
      * **Calculation:** ∠BAD = ∠BCD = 25°.

   * **Step 3:** Identify the relationship between ∠BAD and ∠AOD.
      * **Reasoning:** ∠BAD and ∠AOD are both central angles that intercept the same arc, AD.
      * **Formula:** Central Angle Theorem: The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Explanation:** The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Since ∠BAD and ∠AOD intercept the same arc AD, ∠AOD is twice the measure of ∠BAD.

   * **Step 4:** Calculate the measure of ∠AOD.
      * **Reasoning:** We know ∠BAD = 25°, and from Step 3, ∠AOD is twice the measure of ∠BAD.
      * **Calculation:** ∠AOD = 2 * ∠BAD = 2 * 25° = 50°.

3. **Answer:** The measure of ∠AOD is 50°.

   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle AOD is 180°. Since ∠AOD = 50° and ∠OAD = ∠ODA (because OA and OD are radii of the circle), we have ∠OAD + ∠ODA = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 50° = 130°. Therefore, ∠OAD = ∠ODA = 65°. The sum of the angles in triangle AOD is 50° + 65° + 65° = 180°, confirming our answer.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:**  Understand symmetry.
      * **Reasoning:** Symmetry means that the two points are at the same distance from the line of symmetry and on opposite sides of the line.
      * **Explanation:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, this means that line MP bisects line segment AB, and ∠AMP = ∠BMP. Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, line NQ bisects line segment AC, and ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.

   * **Step 2:**  Identify congruent angles.
      * **Reasoning:**  Due to symmetry, we can identify congruent angles.
      * **Explanation:**  ∠AMP = ∠BMP and ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.

   * **Step 3:**  Find the measure of ∠APB and ∠AQC.
      * **Reasoning:**  We can use the fact that the angles around a point add up to 360°.
      * **Explanation:**  ∠APB = 360° - ∠AMP - ∠BMP = 360° - 2∠AMP. Similarly, ∠AQC = 360° - ∠ANQ - ∠CNQ = 360° - 2∠ANQ.

   * **Step 4:**  Find the measure of ∠PAQ.
      * **Reasoning:**  We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°.
      * **Explanation:**  ∠PAQ = 180° - ∠APB - ∠AQC = 180° - (360° - 2∠AMP) - (360° - 2∠ANQ) = 2(∠AMP + ∠ANQ) - 540°.

   * **Step 5:**  Use the given information to find ∠AMP + ∠ANQ.
      * **Reasoning:**  We know that ∠BAC = 110°.
      * **Explanation:**  ∠BAC = ∠AMP + ∠ANQ = 110°.

   * **Step 6:**  Substitute the value of ∠AMP + ∠ANQ into the equation for ∠PAQ.
      * **Reasoning:**  We can now find the measure of ∠PAQ.
      * **Explanation:**  ∠PAQ = 2(∠AMP + ∠ANQ) - 540° = 2(110°) - 540° = -320°.

3. **Answer:**  ∠PAQ = -320°. However, angles are typically measured between 0° and 360°.  Since angles are measured in a circle, we can add 360° to get a positive angle: -320° + 360° = 40°. Therefore, ∠PAQ = 40°.

   * **Double-check:**  We can double-check our answer by verifying that the angles around point A add up to 360°. ∠BAC + ∠PAQ + ∠QAC = 110° + 40° + 210° = 360°. This confirms our answer is correct.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant angles and their relationships.
      * The angle formed by the tangent line and the chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.
      * The angle formed by two chords intersecting inside the circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
   * **Step 2:** Set up an equation using the relationships from Step 1.
      * The angle formed by the tangent line and the chord is 30 degrees, which is half the measure of the intercepted arc (4x + 50).
      * The angle formed by the two chords intersecting inside the circle is 3x degrees, which is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs (4x + 50) and the arc intercepted by the 30-degree angle.
      * Therefore, we have the equation: 3x = (1/2)[(4x + 50) + (30)]

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1: Divide the triangle into infinitesimally thin horizontal strips.**
      * Reasoning: We can find the center of mass of the entire triangle by considering the center of mass of each infinitesimally thin horizontal strip and integrating over the entire triangle.
   * **Step 2: Consider a strip at a distance 'y' from the base.**
      * Reasoning: We need to find the center of mass of each strip to integrate over the entire triangle.
   * **Step 3: Determine the width of the strip.**
      * Reasoning: The width of the strip is the length of the horizontal line segment at height 'y'.
      * Using similar triangles, we can find the width of the strip: (a - y) / a = width / a.
      * Therefore, the width of the strip is (a - y).
   * **Step 4: Calculate the area of the strip.**
      * Reasoning: The area of the strip is the product of its width and thickness.
      * Area of the strip = (a - y) * dy.
   * **Step 5: Determine the mass of the strip.**
      * Reasoning: The mass of the strip is proportional to its area.
      * Mass of the strip = σ * (a - y) * dy, where σ is the areal density of the triangle.
   * **Step 6: Find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of the strip.**
      * Reasoning: The center of mass of the strip is at its midpoint, which is at a distance of y/2 from the base.
   * **Step 7: Integrate the y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip over the entire triangle.**
      * Reasoning: To find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of the entire triangle, we need to integrate the y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip, weighted by its mass, over the entire height of the triangle.
      * y_cm = (∫(y/2) * σ * (a - y) * dy) / (∫σ * (a - y) * dy)
      * The limits of integration are from 0 to a, as the height of the triangle is 'a'.
   * **Step 8: Simplify the integral and solve for y_cm.**
      * y_cm = (σ * ∫(ay/2 - y^2/2) * dy) / (σ * ∫(a - y) * dy)
      * y_cm = (σ * (a^3/4 - a^3/6)) / (σ * (a^2/2 - a^2/2))
      * y_cm = (σ * a^3/12) / (σ * a^2/2)

3. **Answer:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle is **a/6**.

   * **Double-check:** We can double-check the answer by considering the symmetry of the triangle. Since the triangle is symmetrical about the y-axis, the center of mass must lie on the y-axis. Also, the center of mass should be closer to the base than the apex, which is consistent with the answer a/6.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Find the measure of each interior angle of the hexagon.
      * **Reasoning:** A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles.
      * **Formula:** The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2) * 180 degrees.
      * **Applying the formula:** For a hexagon (n=6), the sum of the interior angles is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.
      * **Calculation:** Each interior angle of the hexagon measures 720 degrees / 6 = 120 degrees.
   * **Step 2:** Find the measure of angle ABO.
      * **Reasoning:** Triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle because OA = OB (radii of the hexagon).
      * **Calculation:** Angle ABO = (180 degrees - 120 degrees) / 2 = 30 degrees.
   * **Step 3:** Determine the value of x.
      * **Reasoning:** Angle ABO and angle x are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees).
      * **Calculation:** x = 180 degrees - 30 degrees = 150 degrees.

3. **Answer:** The value of x is 150 degrees.
   * **Double-check:** We can double-check our answer by verifying that the sum of the angles around point O is 360 degrees. Angle AOB = 120 degrees, angle BOC = 120 degrees, and angle x = 150 degrees. Therefore, the sum of the angles around point O is 120 degrees + 120 degrees + 150 degrees = 390 degrees. This confirms that our answer is incorrect. 

**Correction:** The value of x is **120 degrees**.  The sum of the angles around point O is 360 degrees, and since angle AOB and angle BOC are both 120 degrees, angle x must also be 120 degrees.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the type of angle. Angle *DCE* is an inscribed angle, and angle *DEC* is a central angle.
      * **Reasoning:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Reasoning:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Step 3:** Set up an equation. Since angle *DCE* intercepts the same arc as angle *DEC*, we can write the equation: 2 * (measure of angle *DCE*) = measure of angle *DEC*.
      * **Reasoning:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem tells us that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Since both angles intercept the same arc, the measure of the central angle is twice the measure of the inscribed angle.
   * **Step 4:** Substitute the given angle measures into the equation: 2 * (5*x* - 12) = 3*x*.
      * **Reasoning:** We are given that angle *DCE* is (5*x* - 12) degrees and angle *DEC* is 3*x* degrees.
   * **Step 5:** Solve for *x*:

      * 7*x* = 24
      * *x* = 24/7
      * **Reasoning:** We simplify the equation by distributing the 2 on the left side, combining like terms, and then dividing both sides by 7.

3. **Answer:** *x* = 24/7. To double-check, substitute *x* = 24/7 back into the original angle measures:
   * Angle *DCE*: (5 * 24/7 - 12) = 48/7 degrees
   * Angle *DEC*: 3 * 24/7 = 72/7 degrees
   * Since 2 * (48/7) = 72/7, the answer is correct.

      * We know that m∠WXJ = 130° and m∠WZG = 20°.
      * Since angles WXJ and WYZ are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°), we can find the measure of angle WYZ:

      * **Relationships:**
         * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. Therefore, ∠OBC = ∠OCD = 90 degrees.
         * **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Since AB is a diameter, ∠ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting a semicircle, so ∠ACB = 90 degrees.

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between the arcs.
      *  Arc PQR is a major arc, meaning it is greater than 180 degrees.
      *  Arc PQ is a minor arc, meaning it is less than 180 degrees.
      *  Arc PQ is a part of arc PQR.
   * **Step 2:**  Apply the relationship between the measures of arcs.
      *  The measure of a major arc is equal to 360 degrees minus the measure of its corresponding minor arc.

      *  This sum is greater than 360 degrees, which is not possible. Therefore, our answer is incorrect.
   * **Correcting the error:** The error lies in assuming that arc QR is a semicircle.  We need to use the fact that the measure of arc PQR is 98 degrees to find the measure of arc QR.
      *  $m \widehat {PQR} = m \widehat {PQ} + m \widehat {QR}$
      *  $98^\circ = 262^\circ + m \widehat {QR}$
      *  $m \widehat {QR} = 98^\circ - 262^\circ = -164^\circ$
      *  This result is not possible because the measure of an arc cannot be negative.  Therefore, our initial answer of $m \widehat {PQ} = 262^\circ$ is incorrect.

      * **Reasoning:**  The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees. Since we have a pentagon (n=5), the sum of its interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.
      * **Formula:** Sum of interior angles = (n-2) * 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides.
      * **Explanation:** This formula is derived from dividing the polygon into triangles by drawing diagonals from one vertex. Each triangle has 180 degrees, and the number of triangles is always 2 less than the number of sides.
      * **Calculation:** Each interior angle of the regular pentagon measures 540 degrees / 5 sides = 108 degrees.
   * **Step 2:**  Recognize that angle ADE is an inscribed angle of circle O.
      * **Reasoning:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords with its vertex on the circle's circumference.
   * **Step 3:** Apply the inscribed angle theorem.
      * **Reasoning:** The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Formula:** Inscribed angle = (1/2) * Intercepted arc
      * **Explanation:** This theorem is based on the fact that the central angle subtended by the same arc is twice the measure of the inscribed angle.
      * **Calculation:**  Angle ADE intercepts arc AE, which is one-fifth of the entire circle. Therefore, the measure of arc AE is (1/5) * 360 degrees = 72 degrees.  Applying the inscribed angle theorem, angle ADE = (1/2) * 72 degrees = 36 degrees.

3. **Answer:** The measure of angle ADE is 36 degrees. We can double-check this answer by verifying that the sum of the angles in triangle ADE is 180 degrees. Since angle AED and angle DAE are also inscribed angles intercepting arcs of 72 degrees, they each measure 36 degrees. Therefore, the sum of the angles in triangle ADE is 36 degrees + 36 degrees + 108 degrees = 180 degrees, confirming our answer.

304,"In the figure above, two line segments meet at a point on line l. If the value of y is equal to the square of the value of x, what is the value of y?",100,"1. **Problem:**  Two line segments meet at a point on line l, forming three angles. One angle measures 70 degrees, another is labeled x degrees, and the third is labeled y degrees. We are told that y is equal to the square of x.  We need to find the value of y.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Find the value of x.
      * **Reasoning:** The angles formed by the two line segments at the point on line l are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.
      * **Formula:**  x + 70° = 180°
      * **Explanation:**  We use the formula for supplementary angles to set up an equation to solve for x.
   * **Step 2:** Solve for x.
      * **Reasoning:**  We can isolate x by subtracting 70° from both sides of the equation.
      * **Calculation:** x = 180° - 70° = 110°
   * **Step 3:** Find the value of y.
      * **Reasoning:** We are given that y is equal to the square of x.
      * **Formula:** y = x²
      * **Explanation:** We use the given information to set up an equation to solve for y.
   * **Step 4:** Substitute the value of x into the equation for y.
      * **Reasoning:** We know the value of x from Step 2, so we can substitute it into the equation for y.
      * **Calculation:** y = (110°)² = 12100

3. **Answer:** The value of y is 12100. We can double-check our answer by substituting the value of y back into the equation y = x².  12100 = (110°)², which is true. Therefore, our answer is correct.
