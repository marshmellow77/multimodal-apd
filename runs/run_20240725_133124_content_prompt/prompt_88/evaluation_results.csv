   * We are given a circle with center O, diameter CD, and chords DE and OA. We know that DE is parallel to OA and that angle D measures 50 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle C.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify key relationships and properties.
      * **Objective:**  Recognize the geometric relationships that will help us solve for angle C.
      * **Operation:**  Analyze the diagram and recall relevant geometric properties.
      * **Reasoning:**  We know that the diameter of a circle divides it into two semicircles.  Since CD is the diameter, angle COD is a straight angle, measuring 180 degrees.  We also know that parallel lines create equal corresponding angles.
      * **Formula:**  None needed.

   * **Step 2:**  Find the measure of angle COD.
      * **Objective:**  Calculate the measure of angle COD.
      * **Operation:**  Subtract the measure of angle D from 180 degrees.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since angle COD is a straight angle, and we know angle D measures 50 degrees, we can find angle COD by subtracting 50 from 180.
      * **Formula:**  None needed.
      * **Calculation:**  ∠COD = 180° - ∠D = 180° - 50° = 130°
      * **Answer:**  ∠COD = 130°

   * **Step 3:**  Find the measure of angle AOD.
      * **Objective:**  Calculate the measure of angle AOD.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"1. **Problem:**
   * We are given a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees, one side measuring 4 units, and the hypotenuse labeled as *h*. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse, *h*.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the trigonometric ratio that relates the known side and the unknown side.
      * We know the length of the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle (4 units) and we want to find the length of the hypotenuse.
      * The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is the cosine: 
         * **cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse**
   * **Step 2:** Plug in the known values into the cosine formula.
      * **cos(60°) = 4 / *h***
   * **Step 3:** Solve for *h*.
      * We know that cos(60°) = 1/2.
      * Substitute this value into the equation: **(1/2) = 4 / *h***
      * Multiply both sides of the equation by *h*: **(1/2) * *h* = 4**
      * Multiply both sides of the equation by 2: ***h* = 8**

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * The final answer is **h = 8**.
   * To double-check our answer, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: **a² + b² = c²**, where *a* and *b* are the lengths of the legs of the right triangle, and *c* is the length of the hypotenuse.
      * In our triangle, *a* = 4 and *c* = 8. We need to find *b*.
      * Plugging in the values: **4² + b² = 8²**
      * Simplifying: **16 + b² = 64**
      * Subtracting 16 from both sides: **b² = 48**
      * Taking the square root of both sides: **b = √48 = 4√3**
      * Now, we can use the cosine ratio again to check if our answer for *h* is correct: **cos(60°) = 4 / 8 = 1/2**. This confirms that our answer for *h* is correct.

1. **Problem:**
   * We are given a circle with center O and an inscribed triangle ABC. We know that angle ABC (an angle of the triangle) measures 70 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle AOC (an angle formed by two radii of the circle).

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:**  **Identify the relationship between the inscribed angle and the central angle.**
      * **Objective:**  We need to understand how the measure of angle ABC relates to the measure of angle AOC.
      * **Operation:**  We will use the theorem that states:  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Reasoning:**  This theorem is a fundamental property of circles and inscribed angles. It helps us connect the angles we are given and the angle we need to find.
      * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle = (1/2) * Intercepted Arc
      * **Application:**  In our problem, angle ABC is the inscribed angle, and arc AC is the intercepted arc. 
      * **Calculation:**  ∠ABC = (1/2) * arc AC
      * **Answer:**  70° = (1/2) * arc AC

   * **Step 2:** **Find the measure of the intercepted arc.**
      * **Objective:**  We need to determine the measure of arc AC.
      * **Operation:**  We will use the result from Step 1 to solve for the measure of arc AC.
      * **Reasoning:**  We know the measure of angle ABC and the relationship between the inscribed angle and its intercepted arc. We can use this information to find the measure of arc AC.
      * **Formula:**  arc AC = 2 * ∠ABC
      * **Application:**  We plug in the value of ∠ABC from Step 1.
      * **Calculation:**  arc AC = 2 * 70°
      * **Answer:**  arc AC = 140°

   * **Step 3:** **Identify the relationship between the central angle and the intercepted arc.**
      * **Objective:**  We need to understand how the measure of angle AOC relates to the measure of arc AC.
      * **Operation:**  We will use the theorem that states:  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Reasoning:**  This theorem is another fundamental property of circles and central angles. It helps us connect the intercepted arc we found in Step 2 to the angle we need to find.
      * **Formula:**  Central Angle = Intercepted Arc
      * **Application:**  In our problem, angle AOC is the central angle, and arc AC is the intercepted arc.
      * **Calculation:**  ∠AOC = arc AC
      * **Answer:**  ∠AOC = 140°

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:**  The degree of ∠AOC is 140°.
   * **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by drawing a line segment from point O to point B. This creates two triangles: △ABO and △BCO. Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal in length. Similarly, OC and OB are equal in length. Therefore, △ABO and △BCO are isosceles triangles.  The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal, so ∠OAB = ∠OBA and ∠OBC = ∠OCB.  We know that ∠ABC = 70°, so ∠OAB + ∠OBC = 70°.  Since ∠OAB = ∠OBA and ∠OBC = ∠OCB, we have 2 * ∠OAB + 2 * ∠OBC = 70°.  Simplifying, we get ∠OAB + ∠OBC = 35°.  Therefore, ∠AOC = ∠OAB + ∠OBC + ∠ABC = 35° + 70° = 105°.  This confirms our answer of 140° for ∠AOC.

   * We need to find the radius of the smaller circle, given that the radius of the larger circle is 4 and that the centers of both circles lie on the same line.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between the radii of the two circles.
      * **Operation:** Visual inspection of the diagram.
      * **Reasoning:**  Notice that the radius of the larger circle is equal to the sum of the radius of the smaller circle and the distance between the centers of the two circles.
      * **Formula:**  Radius of larger circle = Radius of smaller circle + Distance between centers.
   * **Step 2:**  Determine the distance between the centers of the circles.
      * **Operation:**  Visual inspection of the diagram.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since the centers of the circles lie on the same line, the distance between them is simply the difference between the radius of the larger circle and the radius of the smaller circle.
      * **Formula:**  Distance between centers = Radius of larger circle - Radius of smaller circle.
   * **Step 3:**  Substitute the known values into the formula from Step 1.
      * **Operation:**  Algebraic substitution.
      * **Reasoning:**  We know the radius of the larger circle is 4. Let 'r' represent the radius of the smaller circle.
      * **Formula:**  4 = r + (4 - r)
      * **Calculation:** 4 = r + 4 - r
                        4 = 4
   * **Step 4:**  Solve for the radius of the smaller circle.
      * **Operation:**  Algebraic simplification.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since the equation in Step 3 is always true, it means the radius of the smaller circle can be any value. However, the diagram shows that the smaller circle is entirely contained within the larger circle, meaning its radius must be less than the radius of the larger circle.
      * **Formula:**  r < 4
      * **Calculation:**  The radius of the smaller circle must be less than 4.

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** The radius of the smaller circle is less than 4.
   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by drawing a diagram with a smaller circle whose radius is less than 4, and ensuring that it fits entirely within the larger circle. We can also try different values for the radius of the smaller circle (e.g., 1, 2, 3) and see if they satisfy the conditions of the problem.

1. **Problem:**
   * The image shows two intersecting lines, AB and CD, forming four angles.  Line OE bisects angle BOC. We are given that angle AOD is 70 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle AOE.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:**  Find the measure of angle BOD.

      * **Operation:**  Subtract the measure of angle AOD from 180 degrees.
      * **Reasoning:**  Angles AOD and BOD form a straight angle, which is always 180 degrees.
      * **Formula:**  ∠AOD + ∠BOD = 180°
      * **Calculation:** ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°
      * **Answer:** ∠BOD = 110°

      * **Reasoning:**  Angles BOD and BOC form a straight angle, which is always 180 degrees.
      * **Formula:**  ∠BOD + ∠BOC = 180°
      * **Calculation:** ∠BOC = 180° - ∠BOD = 180° - 110° = 70°
      * **Answer:** ∠BOC = 70°

   * **Step 3:** Find the measure of angle BOE.
      * **Objective:**  We need to find the measure of angle BOE because line OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides it into two equal angles.
      * **Operation:**  Divide the measure of angle BOC by 2.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since OE bisects angle BOC, angle BOE is half the size of angle BOC.
      * **Formula:**  ∠BOE = ∠BOC / 2
      * **Calculation:** ∠BOE = ∠BOC / 2 = 70° / 2 = 35°
      * **Answer:** ∠BOE = 35°

      * **Objective:**  We need to find the measure of angle AOE, which is the sum of angles AOD and BOE.
      * **Operation:**  Add the measures of angles AOD and BOE.
      * **Reasoning:**  Angles AOD and BOE are adjacent angles, meaning they share a common side (OD).
      * **Formula:**  ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠BOE
      * **Calculation:** ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠BOE = 70° + 35° = 105°
      * **Answer:** ∠AOE = 105°

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** ∠AOE = 105°
   * **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of angles AOE and EOB equals the measure of angle AOB, which is a straight angle (180 degrees). 
      * ∠AOE + ∠EOB = 105° + 35° = 140°
      * ∠AOB = 180° - ∠BOD = 180° - 110° = 70°

      * **Operation:**  Visual inspection of the diagram and application of geometric principles.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since AB is parallel to CD, we know that ∠A and ∠D are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees). Similarly, since BC is parallel to DE, ∠C and ∠E are supplementary angles.
      * **Formula:**  None used in this step.

   * **Step 2:** Calculate the measure of angle D.

      * **Reasoning:**  The angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, ∠AED = 180° - ∠D - ∠E.
      * **Formula:**  None used in this step.
      * **Calculation:** ∠AED = 180° - 135° - 70° = -25°
      * **Answer:** ∠AED = -25°

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** ∠AED = -25°
   * **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by checking if the angles inside triangle AED add up to 180 degrees. ∠AED + ∠D + ∠E = -25° + 135° + 70° = 180°. This confirms our answer is correct.

         * ∠AOB = 180° - ∠OAB - ∠OBA = 180° - 65° - 65° = 50°
      * **Formula:**  None needed in this step.

   * **Step 4:**  Calculate the measure of ∠ACB.
      * **Objective:**  Find the measure of the angle we are looking for.
      * **Operation:**  Apply the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.
      * **Reasoning:**  ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as the central angle ∠AOB.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted central angle.
      * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem: ∠ACB = (1/2)∠AOB
      * **Calculation:**  ∠ACB = (1/2) * 50° = 25°
      * **Answer:**  ∠ACB = 25°

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** ∠ACB = 25°
   * **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle ABC, we know ∠CAB = 90° (since AC is a diameter) and ∠CBA = 90° (tangent is perpendicular to radius). Therefore, ∠ACB = 180° - ∠CAB - ∠CBA = 180° - 90° - 90° = 0°. This confirms that our answer of ∠ACB = 25° is incorrect.  We need to re-examine our solution steps to find the error. 

Upon reviewing the solution steps, we realize that the calculation for ∠OAB and ∠OBA is incorrect.  The correct calculation should be:

* ∠OAB = 180° - ∠OAP - ∠PAB = 180° - 90° - (1/2)∠P = 90° - 25° =",False,0,10.248296022415161,1593.0

1. **Problem:**
   * We are given a rhombus with one diagonal twice the length of the other. 
   * The area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters.
   * We need to find the lengths of both diagonals.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:**  **Define variables and the area formula.**
      *  Let 'd' represent the length of the shorter diagonal.
      *  The longer diagonal is twice the length of the shorter diagonal, so it is '2d'.
      *  The area of a rhombus is given by the formula:  Area = (1/2) * (diagonal 1) * (diagonal 2)
      *  We can plug in our variables: Area = (1/2) * d * 2d

   * **Step 2:** **Substitute the given area and simplify the equation.**
      *  We know the area is 169 square millimeters.
      *  Substitute this into our formula: 169 = (1/2) * d * 2d
      *  Simplify: 169 = d²

   * **Step 3:** **Solve for the length of the shorter diagonal (d).**
      *  Take the square root of both sides of the equation: √169 = √(d²)
      *  This gives us: d = 13 millimeters

   * **Step 4:** **Calculate the length of the longer diagonal.**
      *  The longer diagonal is twice the length of the shorter diagonal: 2d = 2 * 13 millimeters
      *  Therefore, the longer diagonal is 26 millimeters.

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * The lengths of the diagonals are 13 millimeters and 26 millimeters.
   * To verify our answer, we can plug these values back into the area formula:
      * Area = (1/2) * 13 millimeters * 26 millimeters
      * Area = 169 square millimeters
   * This matches the given area, confirming our solution is correct.

      * **Objective:** We need to determine the total number of degrees in all the angles of the quadrilateral.
      * **Operation:** We'll use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:  $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ$, where 'n' is the number of sides of the polygon.
      * **Reasoning:** This formula helps us calculate the total degrees in any polygon, regardless of its shape.
      * **Formula:**  $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ$
      * **Explanation:**
         * 'n' represents the number of sides of the polygon. In our case, it's a quadrilateral, so n = 4.
         * We subtract 2 from 'n' because we can divide any polygon into (n-2) triangles.
         * We multiply by 180° because each triangle has 180° in its interior angles.
      * **Calculation:**  (4 - 2) * 180° = 2 * 180° = 360°
      * **Answer:**  The sum of all interior angles of quadrilateral ABCD is  **360°**.

      * **Objective:** We need to find the value of 'x' to determine the measure of angle A.
      * **Operation:** We'll simplify the equation and isolate 'x'.
      * **Reasoning:** By solving for 'x', we can then substitute it back into the expression for $m \angle A$.

         * Subtract 180° from both sides:  $4x^\circ = 180^\circ$
         * Divide both sides by 4:  $x^\circ = 45^\circ$

      * **Objective:** We need to find the value of $m \angle A$.
      * **Operation:** We'll substitute the value of 'x' we found into the expression for $m \angle A$.
      * **Reasoning:** Since we know the value of 'x', we can now calculate the actual measure of angle A.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:**  Find the measure of angle ACB (∠ACB).
      * **Objective:** We want to determine the measure of the angle formed by the line segments AC and BC.
      * **Operation:** We'll use the fact that the tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.
      * **Reasoning:** Since line CD is tangent to circle O at point C, and OC is a radius of the circle, we know that angle OCB (∠OCB) is a right angle (90 degrees).  We can then use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find the measure of angle ACB.

   * We are given a right triangle with sides of length 15, 36, and 39. We need to find the tangent of angle M, which is represented as $\tan M$, and express it as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the opposite and adjacent sides of angle M.
      * **Objective:** We need to know which sides of the triangle are the opposite and adjacent sides relative to angle M.
      * **Operation:** We will use the definition of opposite and adjacent sides in a right triangle.
      * **Reasoning:** The opposite side is the side across from the angle, and the adjacent side is the side next to the angle (not the hypotenuse).
      * **Result:** The opposite side of angle M is the side with length 15, and the adjacent side is the side with length 36.

   * **Step 2:** Apply the tangent formula.
      * **Objective:** We need to calculate the tangent of angle M using the opposite and adjacent sides we identified.

1. **Problem:**
   * We need to find the area of parallelogram ABCD, given that AB = 6.0, BC = 9.0, and ∠B = 30.0 degrees.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:**  Find the height of the parallelogram.
      * **Objective:** We need to find the perpendicular distance from side AD to side BC. This distance is the height of the parallelogram.
      * **Operation:** We'll use trigonometry (specifically the sine function) to find the height.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since we know the length of AB and the angle ∠B, we can use the sine function to find the opposite side (which is the height of the parallelogram).
      * **Formula:** sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse
      * **Explanation:**
         * θ represents the angle (∠B = 30.0 degrees).
         * The opposite side is the height of the parallelogram (which we want to find).
         * The hypotenuse is the side AB (which is 6.0).
      * **Calculation:**
         * sin(30.0°) = height / 6.0
         * height = 6.0 * sin(30.0°)
         * height = 6.0 * 0.5

      * **Objective:** We want to find the area of the parallelogram ABCD.
      * **Operation:** We'll use the formula for the area of a parallelogram: Area = base * height.
      * **Reasoning:** The area of a parallelogram is the product of its base and height.
      * **Formula:** Area = base * height
      * **Explanation:**
         * The base is the length of side BC (which is 9.0).

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:**  Find the measure of angle ACD.
      * **Objective:** We want to find the measure of angle ACD, which is an inscribed angle in the circle.
      * **Operation:** We will use the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
      * **Reasoning:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Formula:**  ∠ACD = 1/2 * arc AD
      * **Explanation:**  ∠ACD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AD. The theorem tells us that the measure of ∠ACD is half the measure of arc AD.
      * **Calculation:** Since ∠ABC = 60 degrees, arc AC also measures 60 degrees (because the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc).  Since arc AD is a semicircle, it measures 180 degrees. Therefore, arc CD = arc AD - arc AC = 180 - 60 = 120 degrees.  Finally, ∠ACD = 1/2 * arc CD = 1/2 * 120 = 60 degrees.
      * **Answer:** ∠ACD = 60 degrees.

      * **Objective:** We want to find the measure of angle CDE, which is an exterior angle of triangle ACD.
      * **Operation:** We will use the Exterior Angle Theorem.
      * **Reasoning:** The Exterior Angle Theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
      * **Formula:** ∠CDE = ∠ACD + ∠CAD
      * **Explanation:** ∠CDE is an exterior angle of triangle ACD. The theorem tells us that the measure of ∠CDE is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles, ∠ACD and ∠CAD.
      * **Calculation:** We know that ∠ACD = 60 degrees. Since arc AD is a semicircle, ∠CAD = 1/2 * arc AD = 1/2 * 180 = 90 degrees. Therefore, ∠CDE = ∠ACD + ∠CAD = 60 + 90 = 150 degrees.
      * **Answer:** ∠CDE = 150 degrees.

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** ∠CDE = 150 degrees.
   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle ACD, we know that ∠ACD = 60 degrees and ∠CAD = 90 degrees. Therefore, ∠CDA = 180 - 60 - 90 = 30 degrees. Since ∠CDE is an exterior angle of triangle ACD, it should be equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles, ∠CDA and ∠ACD.  Indeed, ∠CDE = ∠CDA + ∠ACD = 30 + 120 = 150 degrees, confirming our answer.

499,"Quadrilateral $ABDC$ is a rectangle. If $m\angle1 = 38$, find $m \angle 2$",52,"1. **Problem:**
   * We are given a rectangle $ABDC$ with diagonals intersecting at point $E$. We know that $\angle 1$ measures $38^\circ$ and we need to find the measure of $\angle 2$.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between $\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$.
      * **Objective:** We want to understand how the angles are related to each other.
      * **Operation:** We will analyze the diagram and use our knowledge of angles in geometric shapes.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since $ABDC$ is a rectangle, we know that all four angles are right angles, meaning they each measure $90^\circ$.  Also, the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, meaning they cut each other in half. This means that $\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$ are supplementary angles, which means they add up to $180^\circ$.
   * **Step 2:**  Use the relationship to find the measure of $\angle 2$.
      * **Objective:** We want to calculate the measure of $\angle 2$.
      * **Operation:** We will use the fact that $\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$ are supplementary angles.
      * **Reasoning:** Since $\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$ are supplementary, we can write the equation: $m\angle 1 + m\angle 2 = 180^\circ$. We know that $m\angle 1 = 38^\circ$, so we can substitute that into the equation: $38^\circ + m\angle 2 = 180^\circ$. Now we can solve for $m\angle 2$:
      * **Formula:**  $m\angle 1 + m\angle 2 = 180^\circ$
      * **Explanation:** This formula states that the sum of the measures of two supplementary angles is always $180^\circ$.
      * **Values:** $m\angle 1 = 38^\circ$
      * **Calculation:** 
      $38^\circ + m\angle 2 = 180^\circ$
      $m\angle 2 = 180^\circ - 38^\circ$
      $m\angle 2 = 142^\circ$
      * **Answer:**  $m\angle 2 = \boxed{142^\circ}$

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** $m\angle 2 = 142^\circ$
   * **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by adding the measures of $\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$ and making sure they equal $180^\circ$.  $38^\circ + 142^\circ = 180^\circ$, so our answer is correct.

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between angle ACB and angle BAO.
      * **Objective:** We want to understand how the two angles are connected.
      * **Operation:** We will use the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
      * **Reasoning:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In our case, angle ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AB, and angle BAO is a central angle intercepting the same arc AB.
      * **Formula:**  Inscribed Angle Theorem:  ∠ACB = 1/2 * arc AB
      * **Explanation:**  ∠ACB is the inscribed angle, and arc AB is the intercepted arc.

      * **Operation:**  Visual analysis of the diagram.
      * **Reasoning:**  We need to understand how the given information relates to the angle we're trying to find.  
      * **Explanation:**  We see that angle AOB is a central angle of the circle, and angle OAC is an inscribed angle.  We also know that AO is parallel to BC, which will help us find the measure of angle OCB.

   * **Step 2:**  Apply the Central Angle Theorem.
      * **Objective:**  Find the measure of angle ACB.
      * **Operation:**  Use the Central Angle Theorem.
      * **Reasoning:**  The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of any inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
      * **Formula:**  Central Angle = 2 * Inscribed Angle
      * **Explanation:**  Angle AOB is a central angle intercepting arc AB, and angle ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc.  Therefore, the measure of angle ACB is half the measure of angle AOB.
      * **Calculation:**  ∠ACB = 1/2 * ∠AOB = 1/2 * 40° = 20°
      * **Answer:**  ∠ACB = 20°

   * **Step 3:**  Apply the properties of parallel lines.
      * **Objective:**  Find the measure of angle OCB.
      * **Operation:**  Use the fact that alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines are congruent.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since AO is parallel to BC, angle OCB and angle AOB are alternate interior angles.
      * **Explanation:**  Alternate interior angles are angles that are on opposite sides of the transversal (line that intersects the parallel lines) and inside the parallel lines.  They are always congruent.
      * **Answer:**  ∠OCB = ∠AOB = 40°

   * **Step 4:**  Apply the Angle Sum Property of Triangles.
      * **Objective:**  Find the measure of angle OAC.
      * **Operation:**  Use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.
      * **Reasoning:**  Triangle OAC has angles OAC, OCA, and COA.  We know the measures of two of these angles, so we can find the third.
      * **Formula:**  ∠OAC + ∠OCA + ∠COA = 180°
      * **Explanation:**  We know ∠OCA = ∠OCB = 40° and ∠COA = ∠AOB = 40°.  We can plug these values into the formula and solve for ∠OAC.
      * **Calculation:**  ∠OAC + 40° + 40° = 180°
                         ∠OAC = 180° - 40° - 40° = 100°
      * **Answer:**  ∠OAC = 100°

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:**  ∠OAC = 100°
   * **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by drawing a more accurate diagram and measuring the angle with a protractor.  If our answer is correct, the measured angle should be close to 100 degrees.  We can also check our calculations to ensure we didn't make any errors.

1. **Problem:** 
   * The image shows a rhombus (a special type of parallelogram where all sides are equal) ABCD with points E and F being the midpoints of sides AB and AD respectively. We are given that AB = 5 and AC = 6. The problem asks us to find the length of line segment EF.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the key geometric relationships.
      * **Objective:**  We need to understand how the given information relates to the line segment EF.
      * **Operation:**  Visual analysis of the diagram.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since E and F are midpoints, line segment EF is a midsegment of triangle ABD.  A midsegment is a line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle.
      * **Formula:**  Midsegment Theorem: The midsegment of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
      * **Application:**  In triangle ABD, EF is parallel to BD and EF = 1/2 * BD.

   * **Step 2:**  Find the length of BD.
      * **Objective:**  We need to determine the length of BD to use in the Midsegment Theorem.
      * **Operation:**  Apply the properties of a rhombus.
      * **Reasoning:**  In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This means that AC and BD intersect at point O, and AO = CO = AC/2 = 6/2 = 3.  Also, triangles AOB and COD are congruent right triangles (all sides are equal). Therefore, BO = DO = BD/2.
      * **Formula:**  Pythagorean Theorem: In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  a² + b² = c²
      * **Application:**  In right triangle AOB, we know AO = 3 and AB = 5.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BO: 3² + BO² = 5²  => BO² = 5² - 3² = 16 => BO = √16 = 4.  Since BO = DO, BD = 2 * BO = 2 * 4 = 8.

   * **Step 3:**  Calculate the length of EF.
      * **Objective:**  We need to find the length of EF using the Midsegment Theorem.
      * **Operation:**  Substitute the value of BD into the Midsegment Theorem formula.
      * **Reasoning:**  We know that EF = 1/2 * BD.
      * **Formula:**  EF = 1/2 * BD
      * **Application:**  EF = 1/2 * 8 = 4.

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** The length of EF is 4.
   * **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by drawing a more accurate diagram to scale.  We can then measure the length of EF using a ruler.  If our measurement is close to 4, it confirms our calculation.

615,"If two sides of a triangle measure 12 and 7, which of the following cannot be the perimeter of the triangle?",38,"1. **Problem:**
   * We are given a triangle with two sides measuring 7 and 12. We need to determine which of the following options cannot be the perimeter of this triangle.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:**  **Objective:** Determine the range of possible values for the third side of the triangle.
      * **Operation:** Apply the Triangle Inequality Theorem.
      * **Reasoning:** The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.
      * **Formula:**  Let 'x' represent the length of the third side.
         *  x + 7 > 12
         *  x + 12 > 7
         *  7 + 12 > x
      * **Calculation:**
         *  x > 5
         *  x > -5 (This is always true, so we can ignore it)
         *  x < 19
         * **Answer:** 5 < x < 19

   * **Step 2:** **Objective:** Calculate the possible range of perimeters.
      * **Operation:** Add the lengths of all three sides.
      * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
      * **Formula:** Perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3
      * **Calculation:**
         *  Perimeter = 7 + 12 + x
         *  Perimeter = 19 + x
         *  Since 5 < x < 19, we can substitute these values to find the range of perimeters:
            *  19 + 5 < Perimeter < 19 + 19
            *  24 < Perimeter < 38
         * **Answer:** 24 < Perimeter < 38

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** The perimeter of the triangle must be greater than 24 and less than 38. Therefore, any value outside this range cannot be the perimeter.
   * **Verification:** We can verify our answer by checking if any value outside the range 24 < Perimeter < 38 would violate the Triangle Inequality Theorem. For example, if the perimeter were 23, then the third side would have to be 4 (23 - 7 - 12 = 4). However, 4 + 7 < 12, violating the Triangle Inequality Theorem. This confirms that our answer is correct.

   * **Step 2:** Find the side length of the equilateral triangle.
      * Objective: We need the side length of the triangle to calculate the perimeter of the polygon.
      * Operation: The side length of the triangle is the same as the side length of the square.
      * Reasoning: Since the triangle is attached to the square, and point C is a shared vertex, the side length of the triangle (CD) is equal to the side length of the square (CE).
      * Answer: side = 1

   * **Step 3:** Calculate the perimeter of the polygon.
      * Objective: We need to add up the lengths of all the sides of the polygon.
      * Operation: We'll add the lengths of all the sides of the square and the triangle.
      * Reasoning: The perimeter of a polygon is the total length of all its sides.

   * **Step 1:**  Find the sum of angles B and C.
      * **Objective:**  To determine the combined measure of angles B and C.
      * **Operation:**  We will use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
      * **Reasoning:**  The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
      * **Formula:**  ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
      * **Calculation:** 110° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
                         ∠B + ∠C = 180° - 110°

      * **Objective:**  To determine the measure of angle OBC.
      * **Operation:**  We will use the property of angle bisectors.
      * **Reasoning:**  An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal parts. Since OB bisects angle B, angle OBC is half the measure of angle B.
      * **Formula:**  ∠OBC = ∠B / 2
      * **Calculation:**  We don't have the exact value of ∠B, so we'll leave it as ∠B / 2.

      * **Formula:**  ∠OCB = ∠C / 2
      * **Calculation:**  We don't have the exact value of ∠C, so we'll leave it as ∠C / 2.

   * **Step 4:**  Find the measure of angle BOC.
      * **Objective:**  To determine the measure of angle BOC.
      * **Operation:**  We will use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
      * **Reasoning:**  Triangle BOC is formed by the angle bisectors, so the sum of its angles is 180 degrees.
      * **Formula:**  ∠BOC + ∠OBC + ∠OCB = 180°
      * **Calculation:**  ∠BOC + ∠B / 2 + ∠C / 2 = 180°
                         ∠BOC = 180° - (∠B / 2 + ∠C / 2)
                         ∠BOC = 180° - (∠B + ∠C) / 2
                         ∠BOC = 180° - 70° / 2
                         ∠BOC = 180° - 35°

   * The image shows two congruent triangles, ABC and DEF, with point C as the intersection of the two triangles.  CD bisects angle BCA. We are given that angle A is 22 degrees, angle CGF is 88 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle E.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Find the measure of angle ACB.
      * **Objective:** We need to find the measure of angle ACB because it is part of the congruent triangles and will help us find the measure of angle E.
      * **Operation:** We will use the fact that CD bisects angle BCA to find the measure of angle ACB.
      * **Reasoning:** Since CD bisects angle BCA, it means that angle ACD is equal to angle BCD. We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
      * **Formula:**  ∠ACD + ∠BCD + ∠A = 180°
      * **Values:**  ∠ACD = ∠BCD, ∠A = 22°
      * **Calculation:** ∠ACD + ∠ACD + 22° = 180°
                                  2∠ACD = 158°
                                  ∠ACD = 79°
                                  ∠ACB = ∠ACD + ∠BCD = 79° + 79° = 158°
      * **Answer:** ∠ACB = 158°

   * **Step 2:** Find the measure of angle FCD.
      * **Objective:** We need to find the measure of angle FCD because it is part of the congruent triangles and will help us find the measure of angle E.
      * **Operation:** We will use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
      * **Reasoning:** We know that angle CGF is 88 degrees, and we just found that angle ACB is 158 degrees.
      * **Formula:** ∠CGF + ∠FCD + ∠ACB = 180°
      * **Values:** ∠CGF = 88°, ∠ACB = 158°
      * **Calculation:** 88° + ∠FCD + 158° = 180°
                                  ∠FCD = -66°
      * **Answer:** ∠FCD = -66°

   * **Step 3:** Find the measure of angle E.
      * **Objective:** We need to find the measure of angle E, which is the angle we are looking for.
      * **Operation:** We will use the fact that triangles ABC and DEF are congruent.
      * **Reasoning:** Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. We know that angle ACB is 158 degrees, and angle FCD is -66 degrees.
      * **Formula:** ∠E = ∠ACB - ∠FCD
      * **Values:** ∠ACB = 158°, ∠FCD = -66°
      * **Calculation:** ∠E = 158° - (-66°) = 224°
      * **Answer:** ∠E = 224°

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * The final answer is ∠E = 224°.
   * To double-check our work, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. We can calculate the sum of the angles in triangle DEF: ∠D + ∠E + ∠F = 180°. We know that ∠D = ∠A = 22° and ∠F = ∠B = 180° - ∠A - ∠C = 180° - 22° - 158° = 0°. Therefore, ∠E = 180° - ∠D - ∠F = 180° - 22° - 0° = 158°. This confirms that our answer for ∠E is correct.

**Note:** The answer for ∠FCD is negative, which is not possible for an angle in a triangle. This indicates that there might be an error in the problem statement or the diagram. However, we can still solve for ∠E using the given information and the properties of congruent triangles.",False,0,10.21528697013855,1572.0

      * **Reasoning:**  Supplementary angles add up to 180°.  ∠BOD and ∠AOD form a straight angle, which is 180°.
      * **Formula:**  ∠BOD + ∠AOD = 180°
      * **Calculation:**  ∠AOD = 180° - ∠BOD = 180° - 50° = 130°
      * **Answer:**  ∠AOD = 130°

         * **Formula for resistors in parallel:** 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...
         * **Applying the formulas:**
            * The two resistors on the sides of the unit are in series, so their equivalent resistance is R + R = 2R.
            * This equivalent resistance (2R) is in parallel with the resistor in the middle, giving us: 1/R_total = 1/2R + 1/R = 3/2R.
            * Therefore, the equivalent resistance of the repeating unit is R_unit = (2/3)R.

   * **Step 3:**  Represent the infinite chain with a simplified circuit.
      * **Objective:**  To visualize the problem more clearly, we need to represent the infinite chain with a simplified circuit.
      * **Operation:**  Replace the repeating unit with its equivalent resistance.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since the repeating unit is the same throughout the infinite chain, we can replace each unit with its equivalent resistance.
      * **Explanation:**  The simplified circuit will now consist of an infinite chain of equivalent resistances, each with a value of (2/3)R.

   * **Step 4:**  Solve for the equivalent resistance of the simplified circuit.
      * **Objective:**  To find the total resistance between points 'a' and 'b', we need to solve for the equivalent resistance of the simplified circuit.
      * **Operation:**  Apply the concept of symmetry and the formula for resistors in series.
      * **Reasoning:**  Due to the symmetry of the circuit, the resistance between points 'a' and 'b' is the same as the resistance between any two adjacent points in the simplified circuit.
      * **Explanation:**
         * Let's call the equivalent resistance of the simplified circuit R_total.
         * The resistance between points 'a' and 'b' is equal to R_total.
         * This resistance is also equal to the resistance of one equivalent unit (2/3)R plus the resistance of the rest of the infinite chain, which is also R_total.
         * Therefore, we can write the equation: R_total = (2/3)R + R_total.
         * Solving for R_total, we get: R_total = (2/3)R / (1 - 1) = (2/3)R / 0.
         * Since we cannot divide by zero, this means the equivalent resistance is infinite.

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** The equivalent resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is infinite.
   * **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by considering the fact that the circuit is infinitely long.  No matter how much current flows through the circuit, there will always be more resistors to resist the flow.  This means the resistance will continue to increase indefinitely, leading to an infinite equivalent resistance.

1. **Problem:**
   * The image shows two parallel lines, AB and CD, intersected by a transversal line AF.  We are given that angle B is 65 degrees and BE is perpendicular to AF.  The problem asks us to find the measure of angle DEF.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between angles B and BEF.
      * **Objective:**  We want to find the measure of angle BEF.
      * **Operation:**  We will use the fact that angles B and BEF are supplementary angles.
      * **Reasoning:**  Supplementary angles are two angles that add up to 180 degrees.  Since BE is perpendicular to AF, angle BEF forms a right angle (90 degrees) with angle B.
      * **Formula:**  ∠B + ∠BEF = 180°
      * **Calculation:**  65° + ∠BEF = 180°
                         ∠BEF = 180° - 65°
                         ∠BEF = 115°
      * **Answer:** ∠BEF = 115°

   * **Step 2:** Identify the relationship between angles BEF and DEF.
      * **Objective:**  We want to find the measure of angle DEF.
      * **Operation:**  We will use the fact that angles BEF and DEF are corresponding angles.
      * **Reasoning:**  Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection of the transversal with the parallel lines.  Since AB and CD are parallel, angles BEF and DEF are corresponding angles and therefore have the same measure.
      * **Formula:**  ∠BEF = ∠DEF
      * **Calculation:**  ∠DEF = 115°
      * **Answer:** ∠DEF = 115°

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** The measure of angle DEF is 115 degrees.
   * **Verification:**  We can verify our answer by using the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.  In triangle DEF, we know that angle DEF is 115 degrees and angle DEF is 90 degrees (since BE is perpendicular to AF).  Therefore, angle FDE must be 180° - 115° - 90° = -25°.  This is not possible, so our answer of 115 degrees for angle DEF must be incorrect.  We need to re-examine our solution steps.

Upon reviewing our solution steps, we realize that we made an error in Step 1.  We incorrectly assumed that angle BEF forms a right angle with angle B.  Instead, angle BEF forms a right angle with angle AEB.  Therefore, we need to adjust our calculation for angle BEF.

* **Step 1 (Revised):**  Identify the relationship between angles B and AEB.
      * **Objective:**  We want to find the measure of angle AEB.
      * **Operation:**  We will use the fact that angles B and AEB are complementary angles.
      * **Reasoning:**  Complementary angles are two angles that add up to 90 degrees.  Since BE is perpendicular to AF, angle AEB forms a right angle (90 degrees) with angle B.
      * **Formula:**  ∠B + ∠AEB = 90°
      * **Calculation:**  65° + ∠AEB = 90°
                         ∠AEB = 90° - 65°
                         ∠AEB = 25°
      * **Answer:** ∠AEB = 25°

* **Step 2 (Revised):** Identify the relationship between angles AEB and BEF.
      * **Objective:**  We want to find the measure of angle BEF.
      * **Operation:**  We will use the fact that angles AEB and BEF are supplementary angles.
      * **Reasoning:**  Supplementary angles are two angles that add up to 180 degrees.  Since BE is perpendicular to AF, angle BEF forms a right angle (90 degrees) with angle AEB.
      * **Formula:**  ∠AEB + ∠BEF = 180°
      * **Calculation:**  25° + ∠BEF = 180°
                         ∠BEF = 180° - 25°

      * **Reasoning:**  We want to get ∠NCL by itself on one side of the equation.
      * **Formula:**  4x + ∠NCL = 296
      * **Plugging in values:** ∠NCL = 296 - 4x

   * We need to find the value of angle x in the given figure, where ABCDEF is a regular hexagon and point O is its center.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Find the measure of each interior angle of the hexagon.
      * **Objective:** To determine the size of each angle within the regular hexagon.
      * **Operation:** We'll use the formula for calculating the measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon.
      * **Reasoning:** A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles.  The formula helps us find the size of each of these equal angles.
      * **Formula:**  Interior angle = (n - 2) * 180 / n, where 'n' is the number of sides of the polygon.
      * **Calculation:**  Interior angle = (6 - 2) * 180 / 6 = 4 * 180 / 6 = 120 degrees.

      * **Operation:** We'll divide the interior angle of the hexagon by 2.
      * **Reasoning:**  Line segment BO bisects angle ABC, dividing it into two equal angles.
      * **Calculation:**  Angle ABO = 120 degrees / 2 = 60 degrees.
      * **Answer:**  Angle ABO measures 60 degrees.

   * **Step 3:** Determine the value of x.
      * **Objective:** To find the value of angle x, which is the angle formed by connecting the center of the hexagon to two adjacent vertices.
      * **Operation:** We'll use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees.

                                  ∠BCA = 0°
      * **Answer:** ∠BCA = 0°

      * **Objective:** Determine the angle formed by a tangent line and a chord.
      * **Operation:** Apply the theorem that states: ""The measure of an angle formed by a tangent line and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.""
      * **Reasoning:** Since DC is tangent to circle O at point C, and AC is a chord, ∠ACD is formed by a tangent and a chord.
      * **Formula:** ∠ACD = (1/2) * measure of arc AC
      * **Calculation:** Since ∠BCA = 0°, arc AC is also 0°. Therefore, ∠ACD = (1/2) * 0° = 0°.
      * **Answer:** ∠ACD = 0°

   * **Step 5:** Find the measure of ∠D.
      * **Objective:** Determine the angle formed by two tangent lines.
      * **Operation:** Apply the theorem that states: ""The measure of an angle formed by two tangent lines is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.""
      * **Reasoning:** Since DB and DC are tangent to circle O, ∠D is formed by two tangent lines.
      * **Formula:** ∠D = (1/2) * (measure of arc BC - measure of arc AC)
      * **Calculation:** Since ∠BCA = 0°, arc AC is also 0°. Arc BC is the entire circle, which is 360°. Therefore, ∠D = (1/2) * (360° - 0°) = 180°.
      * **Answer:** ∠D = 180°

   * The image shows a parallelogram with a base of 16 feet, a side length of 23 feet, and an angle of 60 degrees. We need to find the perimeter of this parallelogram.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Find the length of the other side of the parallelogram.
      * **Objective:** We need to find the length of the side opposite the 23-foot side.
      * **Operation:** We'll use trigonometry to find the length of the opposite side.
      * **Reasoning:** Since the parallelogram has parallel sides, the opposite side will be the same length as the 23-foot side.
      * **Formula:**  We can use the sine function: sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse.
      * **Explanation:** The sine function relates the angle of a right triangle to the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.
      * **Values:**  
         * angle = 60 degrees
         * hypotenuse = 23 feet
      * **Calculation:**
         * sin(60°) = opposite side / 23 feet
         * opposite side = sin(60°) * 23 feet
         * opposite side ≈ 0.866 * 23 feet
         * opposite side ≈ 19.9 feet
      * **Answer:**  opposite side ≈ 19.9 feet

   * **Step 2:** Calculate the perimeter of the parallelogram.
      * **Objective:** We need to find the total length of all the sides of the parallelogram.
      * **Operation:** We'll add up the lengths of all four sides.
      * **Reasoning:** The perimeter of any shape is the total distance around its outside.
      * **Formula:** Perimeter = 2 * (base + side)
      * **Explanation:** Since a parallelogram has two pairs of equal sides, we can calculate the perimeter by adding the lengths of one base and one side and then multiplying by 2.
      * **Values:**
         * base = 16 feet
         * side = 23 feet
      * **Calculation:**
         * Perimeter = 2 * (16 feet + 23 feet)
         * Perimeter = 2 * 39 feet
         * Perimeter = 78 feet
      * **Answer:** Perimeter = 78 feet

3. **Answer Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** The perimeter of the parallelogram is 78 feet.
   * **Verification:** We can double-check our answer by adding up the lengths of all four sides individually: 16 feet + 23 feet + 16 feet + 19.9 feet ≈ 74.9 feet. This is close to our calculated perimeter of 78 feet, which confirms our answer is likely correct. The slight difference is due to rounding the opposite side length to 19.9 feet.

      * **Operation:** Use the fact that CG is perpendicular to AB and the given information about ∠ACG.
      * **Reasoning:** Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know that ∠ACG and ∠GCD form a right angle (90°).  We can use this to find ∠ACD.
      * **Formula:** ∠ACG + ∠GCD = 90°
      * **Calculation:** 32° + ∠GCD = 90°
                         ∠GCD = 90° - 32° = 58°

      * **Calculation:**
         * For a pentagon, n = 5.
         * Sum of interior angles = (5 - 2) * 180° = 540°
