643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"**1. Problem Definition:**

Given a circle with center O, diameter CD, and chord DE parallel to chord OA.  The measure of angle D is 50 degrees.  Find the measure of angle C.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant geometric relationships.**

   * Since CD is a diameter, angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.
   * Since DE is parallel to OA, angle D and angle A are corresponding angles and therefore congruent.
   * Angle CDO is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as central angle COD.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

   * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted central angle.  Therefore, angle CDO is half the measure of angle COD.

* **Step 3: Calculate the measure of angle CDO.**

   * Angle CDO = (1/2) * angle COD = (1/2) * 180 degrees = 90 degrees.

* **Step 4: Apply the Angle Sum Property of Triangles.**

   * The Angle Sum Property of Triangles states that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.  Therefore, in triangle CDO:
      * angle C + angle D + angle CDO = 180 degrees.

* **Step 5: Solve for angle C.**

   * angle C = 180 degrees - angle D - angle CDO = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 90 degrees = 40 degrees.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## 1. Problem Definition:

The problem asks us to find the length of the hypotenuse, denoted by 'h', in a right-angled triangle where one angle is 60 degrees and the side opposite to this angle is 4 units long.

## 2. Solution Process:

**Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio.**

We know the opposite side (4 units) and need to find the hypotenuse (h). The trigonometric ratio that relates opposite and hypotenuse is the sine function:

* sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse

**Step 2: Apply the sine function.**

In this case, the angle is 60 degrees. So, we have:

* sin(60°) = 4 / h

**Step 3: Solve for h.**

* h = 4 / sin(60°)

**Step 4: Evaluate sin(60°) and simplify.**

* sin(60°) = √3 / 2

Therefore:

* h = 4 / (√3 / 2)
* h = 8 / √3

**Step 5: Rationalize the denominator.**

To simplify the answer, we multiply both numerator and denominator by √3:

* h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
* h = 8√3 / 3

## 3. Final Answer:

The length of the hypotenuse, h, is **8√3 / 3 units**.

**1. Problem Definition:**

Given a circle with center O and an inscribed triangle ABC, where ∠ABC = 70°. Find the measure of ∠AOC.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**

   The theorem we need is the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**, which states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Step 2: Apply the theorem to ∠ABC.**

   ∠ABC intercepts arc AC. Therefore, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
   ∠ABC = 1/2 * m(arc AC) = 70°
   This implies m(arc AC) = 2 * 70° = 140°.

* **Step 3: Relate ∠AOC to arc AC.**

   ∠AOC is a central angle that intercepts the same arc AC as ∠ABC.

* **Step 4: Apply the Central Angle Theorem.**

   The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore:
   ∠AOC = m(arc AC) = 140°.

Determine the radius of the smaller circle given that the radius of the larger circle is 4 and the centers of both circles lie on the same line, with the smaller circle inside the larger circle.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Visualize the problem.**
    * Imagine the larger circle with radius 4 and the smaller circle inside it, with their centers aligned.
    * Since the centers are aligned, the distance between the centers is equal to the difference in their radii.

* **Step 2: Identify the relationship between the radii.**
    * The radius of the larger circle (4) is equal to the sum of the radius of the smaller circle (let's call it 'r') and the distance between the centers of the circles.

* **Step 3: Set up an equation.**
    *  4 = r + distance between centers

* **Step 4:  Recognize the distance between centers.**
    * The distance between the centers is simply the radius of the larger circle minus the radius of the smaller circle: 4 - r.

* **Step 5: Substitute and solve for 'r'.**
    * 4 = r + (4 - r)
    * 4 = 4 
    * This equation is always true, meaning the radius of the smaller circle can be any value. However, the diagram shows that the smaller circle is entirely contained within the larger circle. This implies that the radius of the smaller circle must be less than the radius of the larger circle.

* **Step 6: Determine the maximum possible radius of the smaller circle.**
    * The maximum possible radius of the smaller circle occurs when it touches the edge of the larger circle. In this case, the radius of the smaller circle would be half the radius of the larger circle.

**1. Problem Definition:**

Given that lines AB and CD intersect at point O, ray OE bisects angle BOC, and angle AOD is 70 degrees, find the measure of angle AOE.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles.**
    * We are given that ∠AOD = 70°.
    * Since ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), we can find ∠BOD:
        * ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.
* **Step 2: Utilize the angle bisector property.**
    * Ray OE bisects ∠BOC, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts:
        * ∠BOE = ∠COE.
* **Step 3: Apply the angle addition postulate.**
    * ∠BOD is the sum of ∠BOE and ∠COE:
        * ∠BOD = ∠BOE + ∠COE.
    * Since ∠BOE = ∠COE, we can substitute:
        * ∠BOD = 2 * ∠BOE.
* **Step 4: Solve for ∠BOE.**
    * We know ∠BOD = 110°, so:
        * 110° = 2 * ∠BOE
        * ∠BOE = 110° / 2 = 55°.
* **Step 5: Find ∠AOE.**
    * ∠AOE is the sum of ∠AOD and ∠DOE:
        * ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠DOE.
    * Since ∠DOE = ∠BOE (they are vertical angles), we can substitute:

Determine the x-component of the net electrostatic force acting on particle 3, given the charges and distances depicted in the diagram.

**2. Solution Process:**

**Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**

Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to particles 1, 2, and 4.

* **Force due to particle 1 (F13):** This force is attractive (opposite charges) and acts along the diagonal of the square.
* **Force due to particle 2 (F23):** This force is repulsive (same charges) and acts horizontally to the right.
* **Force due to particle 4 (F43):** This force is attractive (opposite charges) and acts vertically downwards.

**Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of each force using Coulomb's Law.**

Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

* **F13:**
    *  Magnitude:  F13 = k * |q1 * q3| / (√2 * a)^2  (where k is Coulomb's constant, 8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2)
    *  x-component: F13x = F13 * cos(45°) = F13 / √2
* **F23:**
    *  Magnitude: F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / a^2
    *  x-component: F23x = F23 (since the force acts horizontally)
* **F43:**
    *  Magnitude: F43 = k * |q4 * q3| / a^2
    *  x-component: F43x = 0 (since the force acts vertically)

**Step 3: Determine the net x-component of the force.**

The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of the individual forces:

* Fnetx = F13x + F23x + F43x

**Step 4: Substitute the values and calculate.**

* F13x = (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (100 * 10^-9 C) * (200 * 10^-9 C) / (√2 * 0.05 m)^2 * (1/√2) ≈ 0.127 N
* F23x = (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (100 * 10^-9 C) * (200 * 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m)^2 ≈ 0.719 N
* F43x = 0 N

Therefore, Fnetx ≈ 0.127 N + 0.719 N + 0 N ≈ 0.846 N

The problem asks to find the length of line segment AD in a right triangle ABC inscribed within a 4x4 grid. The grid has squares of side length 1, and points A, B, and C are located at grid points. Point D is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Determine the coordinates of points A, B, and C.**

   * From the image, we can see that point A is located at (4, 4), point B is located at (0, 0), and point C is located at (4, 0).

* **Step 2: Calculate the slope of line BC.**

   * The slope of a line passing through points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1).
   * Applying this to points B (0, 0) and C (4, 0), we get: (0 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 0.
   * Therefore, line BC is a horizontal line with a slope of 0.

    * **Tangent-Tangent Theorem:** The product of the lengths of the segments of a secant line from an external point to a circle is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from the same point. In this case, we can apply this theorem to point P and the secant line PCD.
    * **Angle Bisector Theorem:** In a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side in the ratio of the other two sides. We can apply this theorem to triangle PAB.

776,Find $JQ$ if $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$.  Rounded to the nearest hundredth.,18.79,"**1. Problem Definition:**

The problem asks us to find the length of segment $JQ$, where $Q$ is the incenter of triangle $JLN$, and we are given that $JL = 16.5$ and $QM = 9$.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Understanding the Incenter:** The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. It is also the center of the triangle's inscribed circle.

* **Incenter Property:**  A key property of the incenter is that it is equidistant from the sides of the triangle. This means that the distances from the incenter to each side are equal.

* **Applying the Property:**  Since $Q$ is the incenter, we know that $QP = QM = QN$. We are given that $QM = 9$, so $QP = QN = 9$.

* **Right Triangles:**  Notice that triangles $JQP$ and $JLN$ are right triangles.

* **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $JQ$. In right triangle $JQP$, we have:

   * $JQ^2 = JP^2 + QP^2$

   * We know $QP = 9$. To find $JP$, we can use right triangle $JLN$.

* **Finding JP:** In right triangle $JLN$, we have:

   * $JL^2 = JN^2 + LN^2$

   * We know $JL = 16.5$ and $JN = JP + PN = JP + 9$.  Substituting these values, we get:

   * $16.5^2 = (JP + 9)^2 + LN^2$

   * We need to find $LN$.  Since $Q$ is the incenter, $QN = QM = 9$.  Also, $LN = LM + MN$.  We know $LM = 9$ and $MN = QN = 9$.  Therefore, $LN = 9 + 9 = 18$.

   * Now we can solve for $JP$:

   * $16.5^2 = (JP + 9)^2 + 18^2$
   * $272.25 = JP^2 + 18JP + 81 + 324$
   * $0 = JP^2 + 18JP + 332.75$

   * Using the quadratic formula, we find that $JP \approx 7.54$ (we discard the negative solution).

* **Finding JQ:** Now that we know $JP \approx 7.54$ and $QP = 9$, we can find $JQ$:

   * $JQ^2 = JP^2 + QP^2$
   * $JQ^2 \approx 7.54^2 + 9^2$
   * $JQ^2 \approx 135.30$
   * $JQ \approx \sqrt{135.30} \approx 11.63$

Therefore, $JQ \approx \boxed{11.63}$.",False,0,6.422140121459961,1132.0

Given a triangle ABC, where the perpendicular bisector of AB intersects AB at point D and BC at point E. AE is connected. If AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

## Solution Process:

1. **Understanding the Properties:**
   * The perpendicular bisector of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts. Therefore, AD = DB = 3.
   * The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is the locus of all points equidistant from the endpoints of the segment. Therefore, AE = BE.

2. **Applying the Perimeter Information:**
   * The perimeter of triangle ACE is AC + CE + AE = 13.
   * Since AE = BE, we can rewrite the perimeter as AC + CE + BE = 13.

3. **Finding the Perimeter of Triangle ABC:**
   * The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC.
   * We know AB = 6.
   * We can rewrite BC as BE + EC.
   * Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC is 6 + BE + EC + AC.

4. **Substituting and Solving:**

Given a parallelogram ABCD, where the angle bisector of ∠ABC intersects AD at point E and the angle bisector of ∠BCD intersects AD at point F. If AB = 3 and AD = 4, find the length of EF.

## Solution Process:

1. **Understanding the Properties of Parallelograms:**
   * Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel.
   * Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal.
   * The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

2. **Applying Angle Bisector Theorem:**
   * In triangle ABE, the angle bisector BE divides AD into two segments, AE and ED, such that AE/ED = AB/BD.
   * Similarly, in triangle BCF, the angle bisector BF divides AD into two segments, AF and FD, such that AF/FD = BC/BD.

3. **Using the Properties of Parallelograms:**
   * Since AB = CD and AD = BC, we have AE/ED = AF/FD.
   * Therefore, AE + ED = AF + FD = AD = 4.

4. **Solving for EF:**
   * Since AE/ED = AF/FD, we can write AE = k * ED and AF = k * FD for some constant k.
   * Substituting these values into AE + ED = 4 and AF + FD = 4, we get:
      * k * ED + ED = 4
      * k * FD + FD = 4
   * Solving for ED and FD, we get:
      * ED = 4 / (k + 1)
      * FD = 4 / (k + 1)
   * Therefore, EF = ED + FD = 4 / (k + 1) + 4 / (k + 1) = 8 / (k + 1).

5. **Finding the Value of k:**
   * Since AE/ED = AB/BD, we have k * ED / ED = 3 / BD.
   * Therefore, k = 3 / BD.
   * Since BD is the diagonal of the parallelogram, it bisects AD. Therefore, BD = AD / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2.
   * Substituting BD = 2 into k = 3 / BD, we get k = 3 / 2.

6. **Calculating EF:**
   * Substituting k = 3 / 2 into EF = 8 / (k + 1), we get:
      * EF = 8 / (3 / 2 + 1) = 8 / (5 / 2) = 16 / 5.

The problem asks to find the length of segment CD in trapezoid ABCD, given that AB = 24, AD = 23, and BC = 16.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify the Right Triangle**
   * Notice that triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.

* **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
   * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   * In triangle ABC, AC is the hypotenuse, AB is one leg, and BC is the other leg.

A square is inscribed in a circle with an area of 18π square units. Determine the length of one side of the square.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Find the radius of the circle.**
    * The area of a circle is given by the formula: Area = πr², where r is the radius.
    * We are given that the area of the circle is 18π square units.
    * Therefore, 18π = πr²
    * Dividing both sides by π, we get: 18 = r²
    * Taking the square root of both sides, we find: r = √18 = 3√2 units.

* **Step 2: Relate the radius to the diagonal of the square.**
    * The diagonal of the square passes through the center of the circle and is equal to the diameter of the circle.
    * The diameter is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is 2 * 3√2 = 6√2 units.

**1. Problem Definition:**

Given a triangle ABC, N is the midpoint of BC, AM bisects angle BAC, and BM is perpendicular to AM at point M. If AB = 8 and MN = 2, find the length of AC.

**2. Solution Process:**

**Step 1: Analyze the given information and identify relevant geometric properties.**

* We are given that N is the midpoint of BC, which means BN = NC.
* AM bisects angle BAC, meaning angle BAM = angle CAM.
* BM is perpendicular to AM, forming a right angle at M.

**Step 2: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem.**

The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides. Applying this to triangle ABC, we have:

```
AB/AC = BM/MC
```

**Step 3: Utilize the Pythagorean Theorem.**

In right triangle BMN, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BM:

```
BM² = BN² - MN²
```

Since BN = BC/2 and MN = 2, we can substitute these values:

```
BM² = (BC/2)² - 2²
```

**Step 4: Express MC in terms of BC.**

Since N is the midpoint of BC, we have:

```
MC = BC - BN = BC - BC/2 = BC/2
```

**Step 5: Substitute the values into the Angle Bisector Theorem equation.**

Substituting the values of BM and MC from steps 3 and 4 into the Angle Bisector Theorem equation, we get:

```
8/AC = [(BC/2)² - 2²] / (BC/2)
```

**Step 6: Solve for AC.**

Simplifying the equation and solving for AC, we get:

```
8(BC/2) = AC[(BC/2)² - 2²]
16BC = AC(BC² - 16)
AC = 16BC / (BC² - 16)
```

**Step 7: Find BC using the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle BMN.**

We know BM² = (BC/2)² - 2² and MN = 2. Using the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle BMN, we have:

```
BN² = BM² + MN²
(BC/2)² = (BC/2)² - 2² + 2²
BC² = 4(BC/2)²
BC² = BC²

This implies that BC can be any positive value.

The problem asks to find the area of square A, given that the areas of two other squares constructed on the sides of a right triangle are 8 and 14.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between the squares and the right triangle.**

   The squares are constructed on the sides of the right triangle, meaning their sides correspond to the legs of the triangle.

* **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.**

   The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs).

   Let the sides of the squares be *a*, *b*, and *c*, where *c* is the hypotenuse. Then, we have:

   *a² + b² = c²*

Given a right triangle ABC with ∠BAC = 90°, triangle ABC is rotated clockwise around point A by 90° to obtain triangle AB'C'.  ∠CC'B' = 32°. Find the measure of ∠AC'B'.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Analyze the rotation.**
    * Rotating triangle ABC by 90° clockwise around point A means that each point in the triangle moves 90° clockwise around point A.
    * This rotation preserves the lengths of the sides and the measures of the angles.
    * Therefore, ∠B'AC' = ∠BAC = 90°.

* **Step 2: Identify key angles.**
    * Since ∠B'AC' = 90°, we have ∠B'AC' + ∠C'AB' = 90°.
    * Also, ∠C'AB' + ∠CAB' = 90° (because ∠CAB' is the angle formed by the rotation of ∠CAB).
    * Therefore, ∠C'AB' = ∠CAB'.

* **Step 3: Apply angle relationships.**
    * In triangle AB'C', we have ∠AC'B' + ∠C'AB' + ∠B'AC' = 180°.
    * Substituting ∠B'AC' = 90° and ∠C'AB' = ∠CAB', we get ∠AC'B' + ∠CAB' + 90° = 180°.

* **Step 4: Utilize the given information.**
    * We are given that ∠CC'B' = 32°.
    * Since ∠CC'B' and ∠CAB' are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°), we have ∠CAB' = 180° - ∠CC'B' = 180° - 32° = 148°.

* **Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**
    * Substituting ∠CAB' = 148° into the equation ∠AC'B' + ∠CAB' = 90°, we get ∠AC'B' + 148° = 90°.
    * Solving for ∠AC'B', we have ∠AC'B' = 90° - 148° = -58°.

The problem asks us to find the length of side AC in isosceles triangle ABC, given that AB = 9x - 1 and BC = 5x - 0.5.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Understanding Isosceles Triangles:** An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length. In this case, since AB = BC, we can set their expressions equal to each other.

* **Setting up the Equation:**

Given a triangle ABC with internal angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O, and ∠A = 110°, find the measure of ∠BOC.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Understanding Angle Bisectors**
    * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Therefore, ∠ABO = ∠CBO and ∠ACO = ∠BCO.

* **Step 2: Applying Angle Sum Property of a Triangle**
    * In triangle ABC, the sum of all interior angles is 180°. So, ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.
    * Substituting ∠A = 110°, we get ∠B + ∠C = 180° - 110° = 70°.

* **Step 3: Analyzing Triangle BOC**
    * In triangle BOC, we have:
        * ∠BOC + ∠OBC + ∠OCB = 180° (Angle sum property)
        * ∠OBC = ∠ABO (Angle bisector)
        * ∠OCB = ∠ACO (Angle bisector)

* **Step 4: Combining Information**
    * Substituting the values from Step 3 into the equation from Step 2, we get:
        * ∠BOC + ∠ABO + ∠ACO = 180°
        * ∠BOC + (∠B/2) + (∠C/2) = 180°
        * ∠BOC = 180° - (∠B/2) - (∠C/2)

* **Step 5: Solving for ∠BOC**
    * From Step 2, we know ∠B + ∠C = 70°.
    * Substituting this into the equation from Step 4, we get:
        * ∠BOC = 180° - (70°/2)

Given a quadrilateral ABCD with ∠BAD = 120°, ∠B = ∠D = 90°, find points M on BC and N on CD such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized. Determine the degree measure of ∠AMN + ∠ANM.

## 2. Solution Process:

**Step 1: Reflecting Points**

* Reflect point A across line BC to obtain point A'. Similarly, reflect point A across line CD to obtain point A''.

**Reasoning:**

* The perimeter of triangle AMN is equal to the sum of the distances AM, MN, and NA.
* By reflecting point A across BC and CD, we create segments A'M and A''N, which are equal in length to AM and AN respectively.
* Therefore, the perimeter of triangle AMN is equal to the sum of A'M, MN, and A''N.

**Step 2: Minimizing the Perimeter**

* The shortest path between points A' and A'' is a straight line.
* Therefore, the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized when points M and N are chosen such that A'M + MN + A''N is minimized.
* This occurs when M and N lie on the straight line segment A'A''.

**Step 3: Finding ∠AMN + ∠ANM**

* Since A'M and A''N are reflections of AM and AN, ∠A'MA = ∠AMA and ∠A''NA = ∠ANA.
* Therefore, ∠AMN + ∠ANM = (∠A'MA + ∠AMA) + (∠A''NA + ∠ANA) = 2∠A'MA + 2∠A''NA.

The problem involves two parallel lines intersected by a transversal. We are given the expressions for two corresponding angles and need to find the value of 'y'.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Corresponding Angles:** Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection of the transversal with the parallel lines. They are equal in measure.

* **Setting up the Equation:** Since the angles marked as 2x + 6 and 3/5y + 2 are corresponding angles, we can set their expressions equal to each other:

**1. Problem Definition:**

Given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees, find the measure of angle E.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Identify congruent angles.**
    * Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, we know that corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle A = angle D = 22 degrees.

* **Step 2: Find angle BCD.**
    * CD bisects angle BCA, meaning angle BCD = angle ACD = (1/2) * angle BCA.
    * Since angle A = 22 degrees and angle A + angle BCA = 180 degrees (angles on a straight line), we have angle BCA = 180 - 22 = 158 degrees.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Understanding Symmetry**
   * Symmetry with respect to a line means that for every point on one side of the line, there is a corresponding point on the other side at an equal distance from the line.
   * Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to MP, line MP is the perpendicular bisector of segment AB. This implies that ∠AMP = ∠BMP = 90° and AP = BP.
   * Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to NQ, line NQ is the perpendicular bisector of segment AC. This implies that ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ = 90° and AQ = CQ.

* **Step 2: Analyzing Triangles**
   * Consider triangle AMP. Since ∠AMP = 90° and AP = BP, triangle AMP is a right-angled isosceles triangle. Therefore, ∠MAP = ∠MPA = 45°.
   * Similarly, in triangle ANQ, ∠ANQ = 90° and AQ = CQ, making it a right-angled isosceles triangle. Therefore, ∠NAQ = ∠NQA = 45°.

   In this case, we can apply the theorem to angle CHJ:

   *  ∠CHJ = (1/2) * (arc GH + arc KJ)

* **Step 2: Substitute the given values**

   We know that arc GH = 83 degrees and arc KJ = (2x - 27) degrees. Substituting these values into the equation from Step 1:

   * ∠CHJ = (1/2) * (83 + (2x - 27))

   * The angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

* **Step 2: Apply the angle relationships to set up an equation.**

   * The angle formed by the tangent line and the chord is 30°. This is half the measure of the intercepted arc, which is (4x + 50)°.
   * The angle formed by the two chords intersecting inside the circle is 3x°. This is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs, which are (4x + 50)° and the remaining arc.

   Therefore, we can write the equation: 
   3x° = (1/2)[(4x + 50)° + (remaining arc)]

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Understanding Center of Mass:** The center of mass of a body is the point where the entire mass of the body can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object with uniform density, the center of mass coincides with the geometric center.

* **Geometric Center of a Triangle:** The geometric center of a triangle is the point where the three medians of the triangle intersect. A median is a line segment drawn from a vertex of the triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side.

* **Finding the y-coordinate:**
    * Since the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, the median from the right angle vertex (the apex) bisects the base.
    * This median also divides the triangle into two congruent right triangles.
    * The y-coordinate of the center of mass is the same as the y-coordinate of the midpoint of the median from the apex.

* **Understanding the Circuit:** The circuit consists of an infinite repetition of a basic unit. This unit comprises three resistors in parallel (R, R, R) connected in series with another resistor (R).

* **Simplifying the Unit:**
    * The three parallel resistors (R, R, R) have an equivalent resistance of R/3 (using the formula for parallel resistors: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3).
    * This equivalent resistance (R/3) is in series with another resistor (R), resulting in a total resistance of R + R/3 = 4R/3 for the basic unit.

* **Infinite Repetition:** Since the circuit repeats infinitely, we can consider the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit (R_total) as the sum of the resistance of the first unit (4R/3) and the resistance of the remaining infinite chain (which is also R_total).

* **Equation:** This leads to the equation: R_total = 4R/3 + R_total

**1. Problem Definition:**

The problem asks to find the value of angle x in the given figure, where ABCDEF is a regular hexagon and O is its center.

**2. Solution Process:**

* **Step 1: Understanding Regular Hexagons**
    * A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles.
    * The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is (6-2) * 180° = 720°.
    * Therefore, each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures 720°/6 = 120°.

* **Step 2: Finding Angle AOB**
    * Since O is the center of the hexagon, line segments OA and OB are radii of the hexagon and are equal in length.
    * Triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle with angles AOB, OAB, and OBA.
    * Angle AOB is the central angle of the hexagon corresponding to side AB.
    * The central angle of a regular hexagon is 360°/6 = 60°.

* **Step 3: Finding Angle ABO**
    * In triangle AOB, the sum of the interior angles is 180°.
    * Therefore, angle ABO = (180° - angle AOB - angle OAB) / 2 = (180° - 60° - 60°) / 2 = 30°.

* **Step 4: Finding Angle x**
    * Angle x is the sum of angles ABO and OBC.
    * Angle OBC is half of angle ABC, which is an interior angle of the hexagon.
    * Therefore, angle OBC = 120°/2 = 60°.
