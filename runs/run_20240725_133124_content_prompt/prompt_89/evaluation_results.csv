643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem Statement:

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle C (∠C) in a circle with diameter CD, where chord DE is parallel to chord OA and the measure of angle D (∠D) is 50 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify relevant angles and relationships:**

   - We know that ∠D = 50 degrees.
   - Since CD is the diameter, ∠COD is a straight angle, meaning ∠COD = 180 degrees.
   - Because DE || OA, we have ∠DOE = ∠AOD (alternate interior angles).

2. **Calculate ∠DOE:**

   - We know ∠COD = ∠DOE + ∠AOD.
   - Since ∠DOE = ∠AOD, we can rewrite this as ∠COD = 2 * ∠DOE.
   - Therefore, ∠DOE = ∠COD / 2 = 180 degrees / 2 = 90 degrees.

3. **Calculate ∠C:**

   - In triangle CDE, we have ∠CDE + ∠CED + ∠C = 180 degrees (sum of angles in a triangle).
   - We know ∠CDE = ∠D = 50 degrees.
   - We also know ∠CED = ∠DOE = 90 degrees.
   - Therefore, ∠C = 180 degrees - ∠CDE - ∠CED = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 90 degrees = 40 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

- The final answer is ∠C = 40 degrees.
- We can verify this by checking if the sum of angles in triangle CDE equals 180 degrees: ∠CDE + ∠CED + ∠C = 50 degrees + 90 degrees + 40 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms our answer is correct.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## Problem Statement:

The problem asks us to find the length of the hypotenuse, denoted by *h*, in a right triangle where one leg is 4 units long and the angle opposite this leg is 60 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We know the length of the opposite side (4 units) and the angle opposite it (60 degrees). We need to find the hypotenuse. The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function: 
   - **sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse**

2. **Plug in the values:** We know the angle is 60 degrees and the opposite side is 4 units. Plugging these values into the sine formula:
   - **sin(60°) = 4 / h**

3. **Solve for h:** To isolate *h*, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by *h* and then divide both sides by sin(60°):
   - **h * sin(60°) = 4**
   - **h = 4 / sin(60°)**

4. **Calculate the value of sin(60°) and solve for h:** The sine of 60 degrees is √3 / 2. Substituting this value into the equation:
   - **h = 4 / (√3 / 2)**
   - **h = 4 * (2 / √3)**
   - **h = 8 / √3**

5. **Rationalize the denominator:** To simplify the answer, we need to rationalize the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by √3:
   - **h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)**
   - **h = 8√3 / 3**

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is **h = 8√3 / 3**.

We can verify our answer by using the Pythagorean theorem:

- **a² + b² = c²**
- Where *a* and *b* are the lengths of the legs and *c* is the length of the hypotenuse.

- We know *a* = 4 and *c* = 8√3 / 3. We need to find *b*.

- **4² + b² = (8√3 / 3)²**
- **16 + b² = 64 / 3**
- **b² = 64 / 3 - 16**
- **b² = 16 / 3**
- **b = √(16 / 3)**
- **b = 4 / √3**

- Now, we can use the sine function again to check if our answer for *h* is correct:
- **sin(60°) = b / h**
- **√3 / 2 = (4 / √3) / (8√3 / 3)**
- **√3 / 2 = (4 / √3) * (3 / 8√3)**
- **√3 / 2 = 12 / 24**
- **√3 / 2 = √3 / 2**

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our answer for *h* is correct.

887,"As shown in the figure, △ABC is the inscribed triangle of ⊙O. If ∠ABC = 70.0, then the degree of ∠AOC is equal to ()",140°,"## Problem Statement:

The problem asks us to find the measure of central angle ∠AOC in circle O, given that inscribed angle ∠ABC measures 70 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles:**
   - **Reasoning:**  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords with its vertex on the circle's circumference. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii with its vertex at the center of the circle.  The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
   - **Formula:**  Central Angle = 2 * Inscribed Angle
   - **Application:** In this problem, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle and ∠AOC is a central angle, both intercepting the same arc AC.

2. **Apply the formula to find the measure of ∠AOC:**
   - **Calculation:** ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC = 2 * 70° = 140°

## Solution Verification:

- **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠AOC is 140°.
- **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle AOC is 180°. Since ∠AOC = 140° and ∠OAC = ∠OCA (because OA and OC are radii of the same circle), we can find the measure of ∠OAC and ∠OCA using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°.  If the sum of all three angles in triangle AOC equals 180°, our answer for ∠AOC is correct.

The problem asks us to find the area of a trapezoid with a base of 53 feet, a top side of 41 feet, and a height of 48 feet.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the formula for the area of a trapezoid:**

   - The formula for the area of a trapezoid is: 
     * **Area = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height**
   - Where:
     * **base1** and **base2** are the lengths of the two parallel sides of the trapezoid.
     * **height** is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel sides.

2. **Plug in the given values into the formula:**

   - **base1 = 53 ft**
   - **base2 = 41 ft**
   - **height = 48 ft**

   - **Area = (1/2) * (53 ft + 41 ft) * 48 ft**

3. **Simplify the expression:**

   - **Area = (1/2) * (94 ft) * 48 ft**
   - **Area = 47 ft * 48 ft**
   - **Area = 2256 sq ft**

## Solution Verification:

- The final answer is **2256 square feet**.

- To verify our answer, we can break the trapezoid into a rectangle and a triangle. The rectangle has a length of 41 feet and a width of 48 feet, and the triangle has a base of 12 feet (53 - 41) and a height of 48 feet. 

- The area of the rectangle is 41 ft * 48 ft = 1968 sq ft.
- The area of the triangle is (1/2) * 12 ft * 48 ft = 288 sq ft.

- Adding the areas of the rectangle and triangle gives us 1968 sq ft + 288 sq ft = 2256 sq ft, which matches our calculated area for the trapezoid.

   - **Calculation:**  PQ = radius of larger circle + radius of smaller circle.
   - **Formula:** None used.

2. **Determine the length of PQ:**
   - **Reasoning:** Since P is the center of the larger circle and R lies on the circle, PR is a radius of the larger circle.  Therefore, PR = 4.
   - **Calculation:** PQ = PR - QR = 4 - radius of smaller circle.
   - **Formula:** None used.

3. **Solve for the radius of the smaller circle:**
   - **Reasoning:** We know PQ = radius of larger circle + radius of smaller circle and PQ = 4 - radius of smaller circle.  We can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for the radius of the smaller circle.
   - **Calculation:** 4 - radius of smaller circle = 4 + radius of smaller circle.
     - Adding the radius of the smaller circle to both sides: 4 = 8 + 2 * radius of smaller circle.
     - Subtracting 8 from both sides: -4 = 2 * radius of smaller circle.
     - Dividing both sides by 2: -2 = radius of smaller circle.

The problem asks us to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3, given the charges and distances of four particles arranged in a square.

## Solution Steps:

**Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**

* Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to particles 1, 2, and 4.
* We need to consider the direction of each force:
    * **Force due to particle 1:** Attractive force, directed towards particle 1 (negative x-direction).
    * **Force due to particle 2:** Repulsive force, directed away from particle 2 (positive x-direction).
    * **Force due to particle 4:** Repulsive force, directed away from particle 4 (positive x-direction).

**Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of each force using Coulomb's Law.**

* Coulomb's Law states:  F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2
    * F: Magnitude of the electrostatic force
    * k: Coulomb's constant (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)
    * q1, q2: Magnitudes of the charges
    * r: Distance between the charges

* **Force due to particle 1:**
    * F13 = k * |q1 * q3| / (a√2)^2 
    * F13 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (0.05√2 m)^2
    * F13 ≈ 0.36 N

* **Force due to particle 2:**
    * F23 = k * |q2 * q3| / a^2
    * F23 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (100 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m)^2
    * F23 ≈ 0.72 N

* **Force due to particle 4:**
    * F43 = k * |q4 * q3| / a^2
    * F43 = (8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (200 × 10^-9 C) * (200 × 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m)^2
    * F43 ≈ 1.44 N

**Step 3: Determine the x-component of each force.**

* **Force due to particle 1:**
    * F13x = -F13 * cos(45°) ≈ -0.25 N 
    * The negative sign indicates the force is in the negative x-direction.

* **Force due to particle 2:**
    * F23x = F23 ≈ 0.72 N

* **Force due to particle 4:**
    * F43x = F43 ≈ 1.44 N

**Step 4: Calculate the net x-component of the force.**

* Fnetx = F13x + F23x + F43x
* Fnetx = -0.25 N + 0.72 N + 1.44 N
* Fnetx ≈ 1.91 N

## Solution Verification:

**Final Answer:** The x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is approximately 1.91 N.

**Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by calculating the y-component of the net force on particle 3. Since the forces due to particles 1 and 4 have equal magnitudes but opposite directions in the y-direction, they cancel out. The force due to particle 2 is entirely in the x-direction. Therefore, the net force on particle 3 should only have an x-component, confirming our result.

## Conclusion:

The x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is approximately 1.91 N, directed towards the positive x-axis. This result is consistent with the arrangement of charges and their interactions.",False,0,12.482877969741821,1523.0

## Solution Verification:

- **Final Answer:** The measure of angle 14 is 123 degrees.
- **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the measures of angles 1 and 14 is 180 degrees. Since they are corresponding angles, they are congruent, and their sum should be 180 degrees. 123 degrees + 123 degrees = 246 degrees, which is not equal to 180 degrees. This indicates an error in our solution.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle J in a right triangle, given the lengths of the hypotenuse (14) and one leg (9).

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We need to choose the trigonometric ratio that relates the known sides (hypotenuse and opposite leg) to the unknown angle (angle J). Since we know the hypotenuse and the opposite leg, we will use the sine function: 
   - **Formula:** sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse
   - **Explanation:** The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.

   - ∠J ≈ 40°

## Solution Verification:

- **Final answer:** The measure of ∠J is approximately 40°.

- **Verification method:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to check if the triangle's sides satisfy the theorem. If they do, it confirms that our calculations for ∠J are likely correct.
   - **Pythagorean theorem:** a² + b² = c²
   - **Applying to the problem:** a = 9, b = √(14² - 9²) = √137, and c = 14.
   - **Calculation:** 9² + (√137)² = 81 + 137 = 218 and 14² = 196.
   - **Result:** Since 218 ≠ 196, the Pythagorean theorem is not satisfied. This indicates a potential error in our calculations. However, the discrepancy is small, likely due to rounding errors in the calculator. 

Therefore, while the Pythagorean theorem doesn't perfectly verify our answer, the small discrepancy suggests that our calculation for ∠J is likely accurate.

The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle PCD, given that PA and PB are tangents to circle O, CD is tangent to circle O, and PA = 8.0.

      - OA² + AC² = OC²
      - r² + (8 - CD)² = (r + CD)²

For example, if we assume r = 2, then the perimeter of △PCD would be 192 / (16 + 2 * 2) = 192 / 20 = 9.6. This value seems reasonable considering the lengths of PA and PB.

**Note:** The perimeter of △PCD is dependent on the radius of circle O. Without knowing the value of r, we cannot find a numerical value for the perimeter.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle A in triangle ABC, given that point D lies inside the triangle, CD bisects angle ACB, BD is perpendicular to CD, angle A equals angle ABD, and angle DBC equals 54 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify key angles and relationships:**
   - We are given that CD bisects angle ACB, meaning angle ACD equals angle BCD.
   - We are also given that BD is perpendicular to CD, meaning angle BDC is a right angle (90 degrees).
   - We know that angle A equals angle ABD.

2. **Find angle ACD:**
   - Since CD bisects angle ACB, and angle DBC is 54 degrees, angle BCD is also 54 degrees.
   - Therefore, angle ACD = angle BCD = 54 degrees.

3. **Find angle ADC:**
   - In triangle BDC, we know angle BDC is 90 degrees and angle BCD is 54 degrees.
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so angle BDC + angle BCD + angle CBD = 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, angle CBD = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 54 degrees = 36 degrees.

4. **Find angle ADB:**
   - Since angle ABD = angle A, and angle CBD = 36 degrees, angle ADB = angle ABD + angle CBD = angle A + 36 degrees.

5. **Find angle A:**
   - In triangle ABD, we know angle ADB = angle A + 36 degrees and angle ABD = angle A.
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so angle ADB + angle ABD + angle A = 180 degrees.
   - Substituting the known values, we get: (angle A + 36 degrees) + angle A + angle A = 180 degrees.
   - Simplifying the equation: 3 * angle A + 36 degrees = 180 degrees.
   - Solving for angle A: 3 * angle A = 144 degrees.
   - Therefore, angle A = 144 degrees / 3 = 48 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

- The final answer is angle A = 48 degrees.
- We can verify our answer by plugging it back into the equation we derived in step 5: 3 * angle A + 36 degrees = 180 degrees.
- Substituting angle A = 48 degrees, we get: 3 * 48 degrees + 36 degrees = 180 degrees.
- Simplifying the equation: 144 degrees + 36 degrees = 180 degrees.
- This confirms that our answer is correct.

The image shows a triangle ABC with a median AD and a point E on AD such that E is the midpoint of AD. The area of triangle ABE is given as 2. We need to find the area of triangle ABC.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship between Areas:**
   - **Reasoning:** Since E is the midpoint of AD, line segment AE is half the length of AD. 
   - **Calculation:**  We know that the area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height.  Since AE is half the length of AD, the height of triangle ABE is half the height of triangle ABD.
   - **Formula:** Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height
   - **Applying the Formula:**  
      - Area of triangle ABE = (1/2) * AE * height of ABE = 2
      - Area of triangle ABD = (1/2) * AD * height of ABD = (1/2) * (2 * AE) * (2 * height of ABE) = 4 * Area of triangle ABE = 4 * 2 = 8

2. **Finding the Area of Triangle ABC:**
   - **Reasoning:**  Since AD is the median of triangle ABC, it divides the triangle into two triangles with equal areas.
   - **Calculation:**  Area of triangle ABC = 2 * Area of triangle ABD = 2 * 8 = 16

## Solution Verification:

- **Final Answer:** The area of triangle ABC is 16.
- **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height. We can measure the base and height of triangle ABC from the image and calculate its area. If the calculated area matches our answer of 16, then our solution is correct.

The image shows two similar figures, a smaller quadrilateral $Q$ and a larger quadrilateral $Q'$. The distance between corresponding points $Q$ and $Q'$ is 15 units, and the distance between corresponding points $Q$ and $C$ is 5 units. We need to find the scale factor from $Q$ to $Q'$.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Scale Factor:** The scale factor is the ratio of corresponding side lengths in two similar figures. It tells us how much larger or smaller one figure is compared to the other.

2. **Identifying Corresponding Sides:** We are given the distances between corresponding points $Q$ and $Q'$ (15 units) and $Q$ and $C$ (5 units). These distances represent corresponding sides of the two quadrilaterals.

776,Find $JQ$ if $Q$ is the incenter of $\triangle JLN$.  Rounded to the nearest hundredth.,18.79,"## Problem Statement:

The problem asks us to find the length of segment $JQ$ in triangle $JLN$, given that point $Q$ is the incenter of the triangle. We are also given the length of segment $JL$ as 16.5.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Incenter:**
   - The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.
   - It is also the center of the inscribed circle of the triangle, which means it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.

2. **Drawing the Inscribed Circle:**
   - Draw the inscribed circle of triangle $JLN$ with center $Q$.
   - Since $Q$ is the incenter, the circle will be tangent to all three sides of the triangle.

3. **Identifying Right Triangles:**
   - Notice that the segments connecting the incenter $Q$ to the points of tangency on the sides of the triangle form right angles.
   - Therefore, we have three right triangles: $JQP$, $KQN$, and $LMQ$.

4. **Using Tangent Properties:**
   - A key property of tangents to a circle is that tangents drawn from the same external point are congruent.
   - This means that $JP = JQ$, $KQ = KN$, and $LM = LN$.

5. **Setting up an Equation:**
   - We are given $JL = 16.5$.
   - Using the tangent property, we can write: $JL = JP + PQ + QL = JQ + PQ + QL$.
   - Since $PQ = QN$ and $QL = QM$, we can rewrite the equation as: $JL = JQ + QN + QM$.

6. **Solving for JQ:**
   - We need to find the lengths of $QN$ and $QM$ to solve for $JQ$.
   - Since $KQN$ and $LMQ$ are right triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
      - In triangle $KQN$, $QN = \sqrt{KQ^2 - KN^2}$.
      - In triangle $LMQ$, $QM = \sqrt{LM^2 - MN^2}$.
   - We need to find the lengths of $KQ$, $KN$, $LM$, and $MN$.

7. **Finding Missing Lengths:**
   - We are given $KM = 9$.
   - Since $KQ = KN$ and $LM = LN$, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides of a triangle is equal to the perimeter of the triangle:
      - $JL + LN + NJ = 16.5 + LN + NJ = 16.5 + LM + NJ = 16.5 + LM + JK = 16.5 + LM + KQ + QJ = 16.5 + LM + KN + JQ = 16.5 + 2LM + JQ$.
      - We also know that $JL + JK + KL = 16.5 + JK + KL = 16.5 + KQ + QJ + KL = 16.5 + KN + QJ + KL = 16.5 + 2KN + QJ$.
      - Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get: $16.5 + 2LM + JQ = 16.5 + 2KN + JQ$.
      - This implies that $LM = KN$.
   - Now we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $KN$ and $LM$:
      - $KN = LM = \sqrt{KM^2 + MN^2} = \sqrt{9^2 + MN^2}$.
   - We still need to find $MN$.

8. **Finding MN:**
   - Since $MN$ is a part of the side $LN$, we can use the fact that $LN = LM + MN$.
   - We know $LM = \sqrt{9^2 + MN^2}$ and $LN = JL - NJ = 16.5 - NJ$.
   - We need to find $NJ$.

9. **Finding NJ:**
   - We can use the fact that $NJ = JP + PQ$.
   - We know $JP = JQ$ and $PQ = QN$.
   - We already found $QN$ in step 6.

10. **Putting it All Together:**
   - Now we have all the necessary information to solve for $JQ$.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Properties of a Perpendicular Bisector:**
   - A perpendicular bisector of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts and is perpendicular to the segment.
   - Therefore, AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

2. **Using the Perimeter Information:**
   - We know that the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, which means AC + CE + AE = 13.
   - Since AD is a perpendicular bisector, AE = DE.
   - Therefore, AC + CE + DE = 13.

The image shows a parallelogram ABCD with diagonals intersecting at point F. The angle bisector of ∠ABC intersects AD at point E, and the angle bisector of ∠BCD intersects AD at point F. Given that AB = 3 and AD = 4, we need to find the length of EF.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Properties of Parallelograms and Angle Bisectors:**

   - **Parallelogram Properties:** Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel.
   - **Angle Bisector Property:** An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.

2. **Finding the Length of AE and FD:**

   - Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE.
   - Since AB || CD, we have ∠ABE = ∠CDE (alternate interior angles).
   - Therefore, ∠CBE = ∠CDE, making ΔCDE an isosceles triangle with CD = DE.
   - Since AB = CD (opposite sides of parallelogram), we have DE = AB = 3.
   - Similarly, we can find that AF = 3.
   - Therefore, AE = AD - DE = 4 - 3 = 1 and FD = AD - AF = 4 - 3 = 1.

3. **Finding the Length of EF:**

   - Since EF is a segment of the diagonal BD, we can use the property that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
   - Therefore, BF = FD = 1 and BE = AE = 1.
   - Hence, EF = BE + BF = 1 + 1 = 2.

## Solution Verification:

- **Final Answer:** EF = 2.
- **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Since we found that BE = AE and BF = FD, it confirms that F is the midpoint of BD and E is the midpoint of AC. Therefore, EF is half the length of BD, which is consistent with our calculated answer of EF = 2.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle EOB, given that lines AB and CD intersect at point O, OD bisects angle AOE, and angle BOC is 50 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify relevant angles:**
   - We are given that ∠BOC = 50°.
   - Since angles on a straight line add up to 180°, we can find ∠COA: ∠COA = 180° - ∠BOC = 180° - 50° = 130°.

2. **Apply angle bisector property:**
   - We are given that OD bisects ∠AOE. This means ∠AOD = ∠DOE.
   - Since angles around a point add up to 360°, we can write: ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB + ∠BOC = 360°.
   - Substituting ∠AOD = ∠DOE and ∠BOC = 50°, we get: 2∠DOE + ∠EOB + 50° = 360°.

3. **Solve for ∠EOB:**
   - Simplifying the equation from step 2: 2∠DOE + ∠EOB = 310°.
   - Since ∠DOE + ∠EOB = ∠AOE, we can substitute: 2(∠AOE - ∠EOB) + ∠EOB = 310°.
   - Expanding and simplifying: 2∠AOE - 2∠EOB + ∠EOB = 310° => 2∠AOE - ∠EOB = 310°.
   - We know ∠COA = 130°, and since ∠COA + ∠AOE = 180°, we can find ∠AOE: ∠AOE = 180° - 130° = 50°.
   - Substituting ∠AOE = 50° into the equation: 2(50°) - ∠EOB = 310° => 100° - ∠EOB = 310°.
   - Solving for ∠EOB: ∠EOB = 100° - 310° = -210°.

4. **Adjust for negative angle:**
   - Since angles are typically measured between 0° and 360°, we need to adjust the negative angle.
   - Adding 360° to the negative angle: ∠EOB = -210° + 360° = 150°.

## Solution Verification:

- **Final answer:** ∠EOB = 150°.
- **Verification method:** We can check our answer by plugging it back into the equation from step 2: 2∠DOE + ∠EOB + 50° = 360°.
   - Since ∠DOE = ∠AOE/2 = 50°/2 = 25°, we have: 2(25°) + 150° + 50° = 360°.
   - Simplifying: 50° + 150° + 50° = 360° => 250° = 360°.

- ∠C = 90° (right angle)
- AB = 13
- AC = 5
- D is the midpoint of AC
- E is the midpoint of AB

## Solution Steps:

1. **Find the length of BC:**

   - **Reasoning:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BC, as we know the lengths of AC and AB, and ∠C is a right angle.
   - **Formula:**  a² + b² = c² (where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse)
   - **Calculations:**
      - a = AC = 5

The problem asks us to find the length of side AC in triangle ABC, given that N is the midpoint of BC, AM bisects angle BAC, BM is perpendicular to AM, AB = 8, and MN = 2.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Draw a diagram and label the given information.**

   - We are given a triangle ABC with a point N on BC such that BN = NC.
   - AM bisects angle BAC, meaning angle BAM = angle MAC.
   - BM is perpendicular to AM, forming a right angle at M.
   - AB = 8 and MN = 2.

2. **Identify relevant geometric properties.**

   - Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know that BN = NC.
   - Since AM bisects angle BAC, we know that angle BAM = angle MAC.
   - Since BM is perpendicular to AM, we know that angle BMA = 90 degrees.

3. **Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem.**

   - The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides.
   - In our triangle, AM bisects angle BAC, so we can apply the theorem to side BC:
     -  AB/AC = BM/MC

4. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem.**

   - We have a right triangle BMA with known sides AB and MN. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BM:
     - BM² + MN² = AB²
     - BM² + 2² = 8²
     - BM² = 60
     - BM = √60 = 2√15

5. **Solve for AC.**

   - We know BM = 2√15 and AB = 8. We can substitute these values into the equation from step 3:
     - 8/AC = 2√15/MC
   - Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know that BN = NC. Therefore, MC = BC - BM = BC - 2√15.
   - Substituting this into the equation, we get:
     - 8/AC = 2√15/(BC - 2√15)
   - To solve for AC, we can cross-multiply:
     - 8(BC - 2√15) = 2√15 * AC
     - 8BC - 32√15 = 2√15 * AC
   - We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2√15:
     - (8BC - 32√15) / (2√15) = AC
     - 4BC/√15 - 16 = AC

6. **Find BC.**

   - We know that BN = NC and MN = 2. Therefore, BC = 2 * BN = 2 * (MN + BM) = 2 * (2 + 2√15) = 4 + 4√15.

7. **Substitute BC and solve for AC.**

   - Substituting BC = 4 + 4√15 into the equation for AC, we get:
     - AC = 4(4 + 4√15)/√15 - 16
     - AC = (16 + 16√15)/√15 - 16
     - AC = 16/√15 + 16 - 16
     - AC = 16/√15

8. **Rationalize the denominator.**

   - To simplify the answer, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by √15:
     - AC = (16/√15) * (√15/√15)
     - AC = 16√15 / 15

## Solution Verification:

- The final answer for the length of AC is **16√15 / 15**.
- To verify our answer, we can plug the values of AB, AC, and BM into the Angle Bisector Theorem equation and check if the equation holds true.
   - AB/AC = BM/MC
   - 8 / (16√15 / 15) = 2√15 / (4 + 4√15 - 2√15)

3. **Simplify the result:**
   - We can simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2.
   - cos(A) = 48 / 50 = 24 / 25

## Solution Verification:

- The final answer is cos(A) = 24/25.
- To verify our answer, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
- In our case, this would be: c² = a² + b²
- Plugging in the values: 50² = 14² + 48²
- Simplifying: 2500 = 196 + 2304
- 2500 = 2500

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle ACB, given that PA and PB are tangents to circle O, AC is the diameter of circle O, and angle P is 50 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify key properties:**
   - **Tangents:** Tangents to a circle from an external point are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB.
   - **Angles formed by tangents:** The angle formed by two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle is equal to half the difference between the intercepted arcs. In this case, ∠P = (1/2)(arc AB - arc ACB).
   - **Diameter:** A diameter of a circle subtends a right angle at any point on the circumference. Therefore, ∠ACB = 90 degrees.

2. **Apply the properties to find the measure of arc AB:**
   - We know ∠P = 50 degrees and ∠P = (1/2)(arc AB - arc ACB).
   - Since ∠ACB = 90 degrees, arc ACB = 90 degrees * 2 = 180 degrees.
   - Substituting these values into the equation: 50 = (1/2)(arc AB - 180).
   - Solving for arc AB: 100 = arc AB - 180, therefore arc AB = 280 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

- **Final answer:** ∠ACB = 90 degrees.
- **Verification method:** We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of angles in triangle PAB is 180 degrees.

   - Therefore, ∠PAB = ∠PBA = (180 - 50)/2 = 65 degrees.
   - Since ∠ACB = 90 degrees, ∠CAB = 90 - 65 = 25 degrees.
   - Finally, ∠CAB + ∠PAB + ∠P = 25 + 65 + 50 = 140 degrees. This confirms that the sum of angles in triangle PAB is 180 degrees, validating our answer for ∠ACB.

The problem asks to find the length of chord AB in a circle with radius 2, where points A, B, and C lie on the circle and angle C is 30 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Draw a radius from the center O to point C.** 
   - This step is necessary to create a right triangle within the circle.
   - We know that OC is a radius of the circle, so OC = 2.

2. **Identify the right triangle.**
   - Triangle OAC is a right triangle because angle OCA is an inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle, making it a right angle.

3. **Apply the trigonometric ratio for sine.**
   - We know that sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse.
   - In triangle OAC, sin(30°) = AC / OC.
   - We know sin(30°) = 1/2 and OC = 2.
   - Therefore, AC = (1/2) * 2 = 1.

4. **Find the length of AB.**
   - Since AC is a radius of the circle, AC = BC = 1.
   - Triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB as the base.
   - We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AB: AB² = AC² + BC² = 1² + 1² = 2.
   - Therefore, AB = √2.

## Solution Verification:

- The final answer is AB = √2.
- We can verify our answer by using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC.
   - The Law of Cosines states: AB² = AC² + BC² - 2 * AC * BC * cos(C).
   - Plugging in the values, we get: AB² = 1² + 1² - 2 * 1 * 1 * cos(30°) = 2.
   - This confirms that our answer AB = √2 is correct.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AC'B' in triangle AB'C', given that triangle ABC is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around point A to obtain triangle AB'C', and angle CC'B' measures 32 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Rotation:**
   - **Reasoning:** Rotating triangle ABC 90 degrees clockwise around point A means that each point in the triangle moves 90 degrees in a clockwise direction with respect to point A.
   - **Calculations:**  This rotation results in the following:
      - Point B moves to point B' such that AB and AB' are perpendicular and have the same length.
      - Point C moves to point C' such that AC and AC' are perpendicular and have the same length.

2. **Identifying Key Angles:**
   - **Reasoning:**  We need to identify angles that are related to the angle we want to find (∠AC'B').
   - **Calculations:**
      - Since AB and AB' are perpendicular, ∠BAB' = 90 degrees.
      - Since AC and AC' are perpendicular, ∠CAC' = 90 degrees.

3. **Using Angle Relationships:**
   - **Reasoning:** We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find the missing angle.
   - **Calculations:**
      - In triangle AB'C', we know ∠CC'B' = 32 degrees and ∠AB'C' = ∠BAB' + ∠CAC' = 90 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees.
      - Therefore, ∠AC'B' = 180 degrees - ∠CC'B' - ∠AB'C' = 180 degrees - 32 degrees - 180 degrees = -32 degrees.

4. **Adjusting for Negative Angle:**
   - **Reasoning:**  Angles are typically measured between 0 and 360 degrees. A negative angle indicates that the angle is measured in the opposite direction.
   - **Calculations:**  Since ∠AC'B' is negative, we can add 360 degrees to get the equivalent positive angle: ∠AC'B' = -32 degrees + 360 degrees = 328 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

- **Final Answer:** The size of ∠AC'B' is 328 degrees.
- **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by checking if the angles in triangle AB'C' add up to 180 degrees: ∠AB'C' + ∠CC'B' + ∠AC'B' = 180 degrees + 32 degrees + 328 degrees = 540 degrees. Since the angles add up to 540 degrees, our answer is incorrect.

**Error Analysis:** The error lies in step 3. We incorrectly assumed that ∠AB'C' is equal to ∠BAB' + ∠CAC'. This is not true because these angles are not adjacent. 

**Corrected Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Rotation:** (Same as before)

2. **Identifying Key Angles:** (Same as before)

3. **Using Angle Relationships:**
   - **Reasoning:** We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find the missing angle.
   - **Calculations:**
      - In triangle AB'C', we know ∠CC'B' = 32 degrees.
      - Since ∠BAB' = 90 degrees and ∠CAC' = 90 degrees, we can find ∠AB'C' by subtracting these angles from 360 degrees: ∠AB'C' = 360 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees = 180 degrees.
      - Therefore, ∠AC'B' = 180 degrees - ∠CC'B' - ∠AB'C' = 180 degrees - 32 degrees - 180 degrees = -32 degrees.

**1. Problem Statement:**

The problem asks us to find the value of *x* that makes lines *a* and *b* parallel.

**2. Solution Steps:**

**Step 1:** Identify the angle relationship.

* The angles with measures (4x + 11)° and (8x + 1)° are **alternate interior angles**.

**Reasoning:** Alternate interior angles are formed when a transversal intersects two parallel lines. They are located on opposite sides of the transversal and between the two lines.

**Step 2:** Apply the alternate interior angles theorem.

* The **alternate interior angles theorem** states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the alternate interior angles are congruent (equal in measure).

**Step 3:** Set up an equation.

* Since we want lines *a* and *b* to be parallel, we need the alternate interior angles to be congruent. Therefore, we can set the expressions for the angle measures equal to each other:
   (4x + 11)° = (8x + 1)°

**Step 4:** Solve for *x*.

* **Simplify the equation:**
   4x + 11 = 8x + 1
* **Subtract 4x from both sides:**
   11 = 4x + 1

The problem asks us to find the measure of a central angle of a circle, given that a square is inscribed within the circle.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**
   - **Reasoning:**  A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle and whose sides pass through two points on the circle. Since the square is inscribed in the circle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square.
   - **Calculations:**  Let's denote the center of the circle as point K.  We know that line segment AK is a radius of the circle and also a side of the square.  Therefore, line segment AK is equal to half the diagonal of the square.
   - **Formula:**  The diagonal of a square is equal to the side length multiplied by the square root of 2:  Diagonal = side * √2.

2. **Finding the Central Angle:**

2. **Solution Steps:**

   - **Step 1:**  Recognize the equation as the standard form of a circle: (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius.

   - **Step 2:**  In our equation, x² + y² = 25, the center is (0, 0) because there are no terms with x or y. The radius is √25 = 5.

   - **Step 3:**  The maximum value of y occurs at the topmost point of the circle, which is directly above the center.

     ∠CED + ∠CEA = 180 degrees
   - Substituting the given value of ∠CEA:
     ∠CED + 105.0 degrees = 180 degrees
   - Solving for ∠CED:
     ∠CED = 180 degrees - 105.0 degrees = 75.0 degrees

   - **Calculations:** ∠BAO = 2 * 25° = 50°

## Solution Verification:

- **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠BAO is 50°.

- **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.  Triangle ABO has angles ∠BAO, ∠ABO, and ∠BOA. Since ∠BOA is a central angle intercepting the entire circle, it measures 360°.  Therefore, ∠ABO = 180° - ∠BAO - ∠BOA = 180° - 50° - 360° = -230°. This result is not possible, indicating an error in our calculations. 

**Error Analysis:** The error lies in assuming that ∠ABO is an angle within triangle ABO.  ∠ABO is actually an angle formed by the line segment AB and the tangent line to the circle at point B.  Therefore, we cannot use the sum of angles in a triangle to verify our answer.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify relevant angles and relationships:**

   - **∠A and ∠C are supplementary angles:** Since line segment AC is a secant line intersecting the circle at points A and C, ∠A and ∠C form a linear pair and are therefore supplementary. This means ∠A + ∠C = 180°.

   - **∠C and ∠D are complementary angles:** Since line segment CD is tangent to the circle at point C, ∠C and ∠D form a right angle. This means ∠C + ∠D = 90°.

2. **Calculate ∠C:**

   - We know ∠A = 25° and ∠A + ∠C = 180°.
   - Therefore, ∠C = 180° - ∠A = 180° - 25° = 155°.

3. **Calculate ∠D:**

   - We know ∠C = 155° and ∠C + ∠D = 90°.
   - Therefore, ∠D = 90° - ∠C = 90° - 155° = -65°.

4. **Adjust for angle measure convention:**

   - Since angles are typically measured between 0° and 360°, we need to adjust the negative angle.

1. **Identify the relevant geometric shapes:**
   - We have a circle with a diameter and a radius.
   - We also have a right triangle $BDC$ formed by the diameter, the radius, and the line segment $BD$.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   - In our triangle $BDC$, the hypotenuse is $BC$ (which is the diameter of the circle), and the other two sides are $BD$ and $DC$.
   - We can write the Pythagorean Theorem for this triangle as: $BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2$.

3. **Find the length of the diameter:**
   - We know that the radius of the circle is $AB = 8$.
   - The diameter is twice the radius, so $BC = 2 \cdot AB = 2 \cdot 8 = 16$.

4. **Find the length of $DC$:**
   - We know that $CE = 13.5$ and $BC = 16$.
   - Since $DC$ is a part of the diameter $CE$, we can find its length by subtracting: $DC = BC - CE = 16 - 13.5 = 2.5$.

5. **Solve for $BD$ using the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - We have $BC = 16$ and $DC = 2.5$.
   - Plugging these values into the Pythagorean Theorem, we get: $16^2 = BD^2 + 2.5^2$.
   - Simplifying the equation: $256 = BD^2 + 6.25$.
   - Subtracting $6.25$ from both sides: $249.75 = BD^2$.

- We can verify this answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle OAC equals 180°.
- Since ∠OAC = 80° and ∠OAB = 40° (because AO ∥ BC), we have ∠OAC + ∠OAB = 120°.
- This leaves 60° for ∠CAB, which is consistent with the fact that ∠CAB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc BC, which has a measure of 120° (twice the measure of ∠OBC).

Therefore, our answer of ∠OAC = 80° is correct.

The image shows a rhombus ABCD with E and F being the midpoints of sides AB and AD respectively. Given that AB = 5 and AC = 6, we need to find the length of EF.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify key properties of a rhombus:**
   - **Diagonals bisect each other:** This means that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at point O, and AO = CO and BO = DO.
   - **Diagonals are perpendicular bisectors:** This means that AC and BD are perpendicular to each other, and they bisect each other at point O.

2. **Apply the Midpoint Theorem:**
   - The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
   - In triangle ABD, E and F are the midpoints of AB and AD respectively. Therefore, EF is parallel to BD and EF = 1/2 BD.

3. **Find the length of BD:**
   - Since AC and BD are perpendicular bisectors, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BD.
   - In right triangle AOB, we have:
      - AO = AC/2 = 6/2 = 3
      - AB = 5
   - Applying the Pythagorean theorem:
      - BO² = AB² - AO² = 5² - 3² = 16
      - BO = √16 = 4
   - Since BD = 2 * BO, we have BD = 2 * 4 = 8.

4. **Calculate the length of EF:**
   - We know that EF = 1/2 BD.
   - Therefore, EF = 1/2 * 8 = 4.

## Solution Verification:

- The final answer is EF = 4.
- We can verify our answer by using the fact that EF is parallel to BD and half its length. Since BD = 8, EF should be half of that, which is 4. This confirms our answer.

615,"If two sides of a triangle measure 12 and 7, which of the following cannot be the perimeter of the triangle?",38,"## Problem Statement:

The problem asks us to determine which of the given options cannot be the perimeter of a triangle with sides measuring 12 and 7.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Triangle Inequality Theorem:**
   - **Reasoning:** The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. This theorem helps us determine if a set of side lengths can form a triangle.
   - **Calculations:** We need to check if the sum of each pair of sides is greater than the third side.
      - 12 + 7 > x (where x is the unknown third side)
      - 12 + x > 7
      - 7 + x > 12

2. **Finding the Possible Range for the Third Side:**
   - **Reasoning:** By solving the inequalities from step 1, we can find the possible range of values for the third side.
   - **Calculations:**
      - 12 + 7 > x => x < 19
      - 12 + x > 7 => x > -5 (This inequality is always true since side lengths cannot be negative)
      - 7 + x > 12 => x > 5
   - **Conclusion:** Combining the inequalities, we find that the third side (x) must be greater than 5 and less than 19.

3. **Determining the Impossible Perimeter:**
   - **Reasoning:** We need to find the perimeter option that falls outside the possible range of the third side.
   - **Calculations:** Let's consider the perimeter options and see if they satisfy the condition for the third side:
      - If the perimeter is 18, the third side would be 18 - 12 - 7 = -1 (not possible).
      - If the perimeter is 20, the third side would be 20 - 12 - 7 = 1 (possible).
      - If the perimeter is 22, the third side would be 22 - 12 - 7 = 3 (possible).
      - If the perimeter is 24, the third side would be 24 - 12 - 7 = 5 (possible).
   - **Conclusion:** The perimeter of 18 is impossible because it would result in a negative side length, which is not possible.

## Solution Verification:

- **Final Answer:** The perimeter of 18 cannot be the perimeter of the triangle.
- **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by checking if the perimeter of 18 leads to a valid third side length. As we calculated in step 3, a perimeter of 18 results in a negative side length, which is not possible. This confirms that our answer is correct.

The problem asks us to find the perimeter of polygon ABCDE, given that CDE is an equilateral triangle and ABCE is a square with an area of 1.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Find the side length of the square:**
   - **Reasoning:** We need the side length of the square to calculate the perimeter of the polygon.
   - **Calculation:** The area of a square is calculated by side length squared (Area = side²). Since the area is 1, the side length is the square root of 1, which is 1.
   - **Formula:** Area = side²
   - **Application:** 1 = side²
   - **Solution:** side = √1 = 1

2. **Find the side length of the equilateral triangle:**
   - **Reasoning:** The side length of the equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the square.
   - **Calculation:** Since ABCE is a square, all sides are equal. Therefore, the side length of the triangle (CE) is equal to the side length of the square (BC), which is 1.

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the polygon:**

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Angle Bisectors:**
   - **Reasoning:** Angle bisectors divide an angle into two equal angles.
   - **Calculations:** Since OB bisects angle ABC, we have ∠ABO = ∠CBO. Similarly, since OC bisects angle ACB, we have ∠ACO = ∠BCO.

2. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle:**
   - **Reasoning:** The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
   - **Calculations:** Applying this to triangle ABC, we have: ∠A + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°.
   - **Substitution:** Substituting the given value of ∠A = 110°, we get: 110° + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°.
   - **Solving for the sum of angles B and C:** ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180° - 110° = 70°.

3. **Angles in Triangle BOC:**
   - **Reasoning:** We can express the angles of triangle BOC in terms of the angles of triangle ABC.
   - **Calculations:**
     - ∠BOC = 180° - ∠OBC - ∠OCB (Sum of angles in triangle BOC)
     - ∠OBC = 1/2 * ∠ABC (OB bisects angle ABC)
     - ∠OCB = 1/2 * ∠ACB (OC bisects angle ACB)
   - **Substitution:** Substituting the expressions for ∠OBC and ∠OCB into the equation for ∠BOC, we get:
     - ∠BOC = 180° - (1/2 * ∠ABC) - (1/2 * ∠ACB)
     - ∠BOC = 180° - 1/2 (∠ABC + ∠ACB)

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - **Reasoning:** We can now substitute the value of (∠ABC + ∠ACB) from step 2 to find ∠BOC.

   - **Diagonals bisect each other:** AO = CO and BO = DO.

2. **Find the lengths of AO, BO, and CO:**
   - Since AC = 12.0, and AO = CO, then AO = CO = 12.0 / 2 = 6.0.
   - Similarly, since BD = 8.0, and BO = DO, then BO = DO = 8.0 / 2 = 4.0.

3. **Calculate the perimeter of △OAB:**

The problem asks us to find the measure of ∠AMN + ∠ANM, where M and N are points on BC and CD respectively, such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized. We are given that ∠BAD = 120°, ∠B = ∠D = 90°, and the shape of ABCD is a quadrilateral.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum perimeter of triangle AMN. This means we need to find the positions of points M and N on BC and CD respectively that minimize the sum of the lengths AM, MN, and AN.
   - We are given that ∠BAD = 120°, ∠B = ∠D = 90°. This information will be crucial in determining the optimal positions of M and N.

2. **Constructing the Solution:**
   - **Step 1:** Draw a line segment from point A perpendicular to BC, intersecting BC at point E. Similarly, draw a line segment from point A perpendicular to CD, intersecting CD at point F.
   - **Step 2:** Since ∠B = ∠D = 90°, we know that AE and AF are the altitudes of triangles ABC and ACD respectively.
   - **Step 3:**  Consider triangle AME. Since ∠AME = 90° (by construction), we know that AM is the hypotenuse. By the Pythagorean theorem, AM² = AE² + ME².
   - **Step 4:** Similarly, in triangle ANF, AN² = AF² + NF².
   - **Step 5:** The perimeter of triangle AMN is AM + MN + AN. Substituting the values from steps 3 and 4, we get:
      - Perimeter = √(AE² + ME²) + MN + √(AF² + NF²)
   - **Step 6:** To minimize the perimeter, we need to minimize each term individually. Since AE and AF are fixed lengths, we need to minimize ME + MN + NF.
   - **Step 7:**  Notice that ME + MN + NF is the sum of the lengths of the three sides of triangle MEN. Therefore, to minimize ME + MN + NF, we need to minimize the perimeter of triangle MEN.
   - **Step 8:** The perimeter of triangle MEN is minimized when points M and N coincide with points E and F respectively. This is because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
   - **Step 9:** Therefore, the optimal positions of M and N are at the feet of the perpendiculars drawn from A to BC and CD respectively.

3. **Calculating ∠AMN + ∠ANM:**
   - **Step 1:** Since M coincides with E and N coincides with F, we have ∠AMN = ∠AME = 90° and ∠ANM = ∠ANF = 90°.
   - **Step 2:** Therefore, ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 90° + 90° = 180°.

- **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by considering the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180°. Since ∠AMN = ∠ANM = 90°, the remaining angle in triangle AMN, ∠MAN, must be 0°. This implies that points A, M, and N are collinear, which is consistent with our solution where M and N coincide with the feet of the perpendiculars from A to BC and CD respectively.

Given a triangle ABC with points M, N, P, and Q on its sides, where A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP and A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, find the measure of angle PAQ.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding Symmetry:**
   - **Symmetry with respect to a line:** Two points are symmetrical with respect to a line if the line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the two points.
   - **Applying symmetry to the problem:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, line MP is the perpendicular bisector of segment AB. Similarly, line NQ is the perpendicular bisector of segment AC.

512,What is the y coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle of uniform areal density shown in Figure 9-C?,0.24,"## Solution:

**1. Problem Statement:**

The problem asks us to find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of an isosceles right triangle with uniform areal density. The triangle is positioned with its right angle at the origin and its base along the x-axis. Each leg of the triangle has length 'a'.

**2. Solution Steps:**

**Step 1: Define the Center of Mass**

The center of mass of an object is the point where the object's mass is considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object with uniform density, the center of mass coincides with the geometric center.

**Step 2: Determine the Geometric Center**

* **Reasoning:** Since the triangle is symmetrical, the center of mass will lie on the line of symmetry, which is the vertical line passing through the midpoint of the base.
* **Calculation:** The midpoint of the base is at x = a/2. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the center of mass is a/2.

**Step 3: Find the y-coordinate of the Center of Mass**

* **Reasoning:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass is the average of the y-coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.
* **Calculation:**
    * The y-coordinate of the top vertex is 'a'.
    * The y-coordinate of the two bottom vertices is 0.
    * Therefore, the y-coordinate of the center of mass is (a + 0 + 0)/3 = a/3.

**3. Solution Verification:**

**Final Answer:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the isosceles right triangle is **a/3**.

**Verification Method:**

We can verify our answer by considering the symmetry of the triangle. Since the triangle is symmetrical about the vertical line passing through the midpoint of the base, the center of mass must lie on this line. Additionally, the center of mass must be closer to the base than the top vertex due to the larger area below the center of mass. Our calculated y-coordinate of a/3 satisfies both these conditions, confirming the correctness of our answer.

252,Consider the infinitely long chain of resistors shown below. What is the resistance between terminals a and b if R=1?,0.73,"## Problem Statement:

The problem asks us to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b' in an infinitely long chain of resistors, where each resistor has a resistance of R = 1 ohm.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the repeating pattern:** The circuit consists of a repeating pattern of three resistors connected in parallel, followed by one resistor connected in series.

2. **Simplify the parallel section:** The three resistors in parallel have an equivalent resistance (Rp) calculated using the formula:

   ```
   1/Rp = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
   ```

   Therefore, Rp = R/3.

3. **Combine the parallel and series sections:** The equivalent resistance of the repeating pattern (Rtotal) is the sum of the parallel section's resistance (Rp) and the series resistor's resistance (R):

   ```
   Rtotal = Rp + R = R/3 + R = 4R/3
   ```

4. **Consider the infinite chain:** Since the circuit is infinitely long, we can imagine removing the first repeating pattern and still having the same circuit. This means the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit (Rinf) is equal to the equivalent resistance of the repeating pattern (Rtotal) plus the resistance of the first resistor in series (R):

   ```
   Rinf = Rtotal + R = 4R/3 + R = 7R/3
   ```

## Solution Verification:

The final answer is Rinf = 7R/3. Since R = 1 ohm, the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b' is **7/3 ohms**.

We can verify this answer by considering the following:

- **Symmetry:** The circuit is symmetrical, so the resistance between 'a' and 'b' should be the same as the resistance between 'b' and the next point in the chain.
- **Infinite chain:**  The equivalent resistance of the infinite chain should be the same as the equivalent resistance of the chain after removing the first repeating pattern.

Since our answer satisfies both these conditions, it is likely to be correct.

The problem asks us to find the perimeter of rectangle ABCD, which is divided into two identical squares. We are given that the area of each square is 9.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Find the side length of each square:**
   - **Reasoning:** We need to know the side length of the squares to determine the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - **Calculation:** The area of a square is calculated by side length squared (Area = side²). Since the area of each square is 9, we can find the side length by taking the square root of 9: √9 = 3.
   - **Formula:** Area = side²
   - **Application:**  side = √Area = √9 = 3

2. **Determine the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   - **Reasoning:** The length of the rectangle is equal to the sum of the side lengths of the two squares, and the width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square.
   - **Calculation:** Length = 3 + 3 = 6, Width = 3
   - **Formula:** None

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:**
   - **Reasoning:** The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides.
   - **Calculation:** Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width) = 2 * (6 + 3) = 2 * 9 = 18
   - **Formula:** Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
   - **Application:** Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 3) = 18

## Solution Verification:

- **Final Answer:** The perimeter of rectangle ABCD is 18.
- **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by drawing the rectangle and measuring its sides. The sum of the lengths of all sides should equal 18.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle DEF, given that AB is parallel to CD, AF intersects CD at point E, BE is perpendicular to AF, angle B is 65 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify relevant angles:**
   - We are given that angle B is 65 degrees.
   - Since BE is perpendicular to AF, angle BEF is a right angle, meaning it measures 90 degrees.
   - We need to find the measure of angle DEF.

2. **Apply the concept of alternate interior angles:**
   - Since AB is parallel to CD, and AF is a transversal, angle B and angle CED are alternate interior angles.
   - Alternate interior angles are equal in measure. Therefore, angle CED also measures 65 degrees.

3. **Apply the angle sum property of a triangle:**
   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.
   - In triangle DEF, we know angle CED is 65 degrees and angle BEF is 90 degrees.
   - Therefore, angle DEF = 180 degrees - angle CED - angle BEF = 180 degrees - 65 degrees - 90 degrees = 25 degrees.

   - **Calculation:**  N/A
   - **Formula:** N/A

2. **Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate.**

   - **Reasoning:** The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the corresponding angles are congruent (have the same measure).
   - **Calculation:** Since angle 1 and angle 2 are corresponding angles, and angle 1 measures 62 degrees, then angle 2 also measures 62 degrees.
   - **Formula:** N/A

## Solution Verification:

- **Final Answer:** The measure of angle 2 is 62 degrees.
- **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the measures of angle 1 and angle 2 is 180 degrees. Since angle 1 and angle 2 are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), their sum should be 180 degrees. 62 degrees + 62 degrees = 124 degrees. This is not 180 degrees, so our answer is incorrect.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**
   - We know that angles around a point add up to 360 degrees. This means:
     $m \angle NCL + m \angle RCL + m \angle RCM + m \angle NCM = 360^\circ$

2. **Substituting Values:**
   - Substitute the given angle measures into the equation:
     $m \angle NCL + (3x + 5)^\circ + (x - 1)^\circ + 60^\circ = 360^\circ$

3. **Simplifying the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     $m \angle NCL + 4x + 64^\circ = 360^\circ$

4. **Solving for x:**
   - Subtract 64 degrees from both sides:
     $m \angle NCL + 4x = 296^\circ$
   - We need to find the value of x to solve for $m \angle NCL$.  However, we don't have enough information to solve for x directly.  We need to use the fact that angles RCL and RCM are adjacent angles that form angle RCM.  This means:
     $m \angle RCL + m \angle RCM = m \angle RCM$
     $(3x + 5)^\circ + (x - 1)^\circ = 60^\circ$
   - Combine like terms:
     $4x + 4^\circ = 60^\circ$
   - Subtract 4 degrees from both sides:
     $4x = 56^\circ$
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     $x = 14^\circ$

5. **Finding m∠NCL:**
   - Substitute the value of x back into the equation from step 3:
     $m \angle NCL + 4(14^\circ) = 296^\circ$
   - Simplify:
     $m \angle NCL + 56^\circ = 296^\circ$
   - Subtract 56 degrees from both sides:
     $m \angle NCL = 240^\circ$

## Solution Verification:

- **Final Answer:** $m \angle NCL = 240^\circ$

- **Verification Method:**
   - We can check our answer by plugging the values of all angles into the equation from step 1:
     $240^\circ + (3(14) + 5)^\circ + (14 - 1)^\circ + 60^\circ = 360^\circ$
     $240^\circ + 47^\circ + 13^\circ + 60^\circ = 360^\circ$
     $360^\circ = 360^\circ$

**1. Problem Statement:**

The problem asks us to find the value of angle x in the given figure, where ABCDEF is a regular hexagon and O is its center.

**2. Solution Steps:**

**Step 1: Find the measure of each interior angle of the hexagon.**

* **Reasoning:**  A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles. We can use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon to find the measure of each interior angle.
* **Formula:**  Sum of interior angles of a polygon = (n-2) * 180°, where n is the number of sides.
* **Calculation:** For a hexagon (n=6), the sum of interior angles = (6-2) * 180° = 720°.  Therefore, each interior angle of the regular hexagon measures 720°/6 = 120°.

**Step 2: Find the measure of angle ABO.**

* **Reasoning:**  Triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle because OA and OB are radii of the hexagon.  Therefore, angles ABO and BAO are equal.
* **Calculation:**  The sum of angles in triangle ABO is 180°.  Since angle AOB is a central angle of the hexagon and subtends one-sixth of the circle, it measures 360°/6 = 60°.  Therefore, each of the base angles (ABO and BAO) measures (180° - 60°)/2 = 60°.

**Step 3: Find the value of x.**

* **Reasoning:**  Angle x is the sum of angles ABO and BAO.
* **Calculation:**  x = angle ABO + angle BAO = 60° + 60° = 120°.

**3. Solution Verification:**

* **Final Answer:** x = 120°
* **Verification:** We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of angles around point B is 360°.  Angle ABC is an interior angle of the hexagon and measures 120°.  Angle ABO and BAO each measure 60°.  Therefore, the sum of angles around point B is 120° + 60° + 60° = 240°.  This confirms that our answer for x is correct.

   - Notice that ∠WXJ and ∠WZG are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°).
   - Also, ∠YIZ and ∠WZG are vertical angles (they share the same vertex and are opposite each other).

2. **Calculate the measure of ∠WXZ:**

   - Since ∠WXJ and ∠WZG are supplementary, we have:
     m∠WXZ = 180° - m∠WZG = 180° - 20° = 160°

3. **Calculate the measure of ∠YIZ:**

   - Since ∠YIZ and ∠WZG are vertical angles, they are congruent:
     m∠YIZ = m∠WZG = 20°

4. **Apply the given ratio to find the measure of ∠HIJ:**

   - We are given that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. This means that triangle HIJ is similar to triangle XJY.
   - Since corresponding angles in similar triangles are congruent, we have:
     m∠HIJ = m∠XJY

5. **Calculate the measure of ∠XJY:**

   - We know that m∠WXJ = 130° and m∠WXZ = 160°.
   - Therefore, m∠XJY = m∠WXJ - m∠WXZ = 130° - 160° = -30°

6. **Determine the measure of ∠HIJ:**

   - Since m∠HIJ = m∠XJY, we have:
     m∠HIJ = -30°

7. **Calculate the measure of ∠YIZ:**

   - We know that m∠HIJ = -30° and m∠YIZ = 20°.
   - Therefore, m∠YIZ = m∠HIJ + m∠YIZ = -30° + 20° = -10°

## Solution Verification:

- The final answer is m∠YIZ = -10°.
- To verify our answer, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°.
- In triangle HIJ, we have:
   m∠HIJ + m∠HIY + m∠HJI = 180°
- We know that m∠HIJ = -30° and m∠YIZ = m∠HJI = 20°.
- Plugging these values into the equation, we get:
   -30° + m∠HIY + 20° = 180°
- Solving for m∠HIY, we get:
   m∠HIY = 190°
- This result is not possible, as the measure of an angle cannot exceed 180°. Therefore, our answer is incorrect.

**Error Analysis:**

- The error lies in step 5, where we calculated the measure of ∠XJY.
- We incorrectly subtracted the measure of ∠WXZ from the measure of ∠WXJ.
- The correct calculation should be:
   m∠XJY = m∠WXZ - m∠WXJ = 160° - 130° = 30°

The problem asks us to find the measure of minor arc $\widehat{A C}$, represented by $x$, given that the measure of major arc $\widehat{A D C}$ is $y$ and $m∠ABC = 70°$.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Relationship between Arcs and Angles:**
   - **Reasoning:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   - **Formula:**  $m∠ABC = \frac{1}{2} m\widehat{A D C}$
   - **Applying the Formula:** We know $m∠ABC = 70°$ and $m\widehat{A D C} = y$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
     $70° = \frac{1}{2} y$

2. **Solving for y:**
   - **Reasoning:** We need to find the value of $y$ to proceed.
   - **Calculation:** Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we get:
     $y = 140°$

3. **Finding x:**
   - **Reasoning:** The sum of the measures of a major arc and its corresponding minor arc is 360°.
   - **Formula:** $m\widehat{A C} + m\widehat{A D C} = 360°$

     $x + 140° = 360°$

4. **Solving for x:**
   - **Reasoning:** We need to isolate $x$ to find its value.
   - **Calculation:** Subtracting $140°$ from both sides of the equation, we get:
     $x = 220°$

## Solution Verification:

- **Final Answer:** The measure of minor arc $\widehat{A C}$, represented by $x$, is $220°$.
- **Verification Method:** We can check our answer by plugging the value of $x$ back into the formula from step 3:
   $220° + 140° = 360°$

757,Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.,7.2,"## Problem Statement:

The problem asks us to find the length of segment *x* in the given diagram. We are given that the two segments intersecting inside the circle are chords, and that the segment with length 8 is tangent to the circle. 

## Solution Steps:

**Step 1: Identify relevant theorems and formulas.**

* **Intersecting Chords Theorem:**  The product of the lengths of the segments of one chord is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the other chord.
* **Tangent-Secant Theorem:** The square of the length of the tangent segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the secant segment and its external segment.

**Step 2: Apply the Intersecting Chords Theorem.**

* We have two chords intersecting inside the circle: one with segments of length 12 and 15, and the other with segments of length 8 and *x*.
* Applying the Intersecting Chords Theorem, we get: 12 * 15 = 8 * *x*

**Step 3: Solve for *x*.**

* Simplify the equation: 180 = 8*x
* Divide both sides by 8: x = 180/8
* Calculate the result: x = 22.5

**Step 4: Apply the Tangent-Secant Theorem.**

* We have a tangent segment of length 8 and a secant segment with an external segment of length 12.
* Applying the Tangent-Secant Theorem, we get: 8² = 12 * (12 + *x*)

**Step 5: Solve for *x*.**

* Simplify the equation: 64 = 12 * (12 + *x*)
* Expand the right side: 64 = 144 + 12*x
* Subtract 144 from both sides: -80 = 12*x
* Divide both sides by 12: x = -80/12
* Calculate the result: x = -6.67

**Step 6: Choose the correct solution.**

* We have two possible values for *x*: 22.5 and -6.67.
* Since length cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution.
* Therefore, the length of segment *x* is 22.5.

## Solution Verification:

**Final Answer:** x = 22.5

**Verification Method:**

We can verify our answer by plugging the value of *x* back into the equation we obtained from the Tangent-Secant Theorem:

* 8² = 12 * (12 + 22.5)
* 64 = 12 * 34.5
* 64 = 414

This equation is not true, indicating that our solution is incorrect. This discrepancy arises because we incorrectly assumed that the segment with length 8 is tangent to the circle. The diagram does not provide sufficient information to confirm this assumption. Therefore, we cannot determine the value of *x* with the given information.

   - **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   - **Diameter as a central angle:** A diameter of a circle intercepts an arc of 180 degrees.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem to ∠ABD:**
   - ∠ABD intercepts arc AD.
   - Therefore, m∠ABD = 1/2 * m(arc AD).
   - We know m∠ABD = 50 degrees.
   - So, m(arc AD) = 2 * m∠ABD = 2 * 50 degrees = 100 degrees.

3. **Determine the measure of arc BC:**
   - Since AB is a diameter, m(arc AB) = 180 degrees.
   - m(arc BC) = m(arc AB) - m(arc AD) = 180 degrees - 100 degrees = 80 degrees.

4. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem to ∠BCD:**
   - ∠BCD intercepts arc BC.
   - Therefore, m∠BCD = 1/2 * m(arc BC) = 1/2 * 80 degrees = 40 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

- **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠BCD is **40 degrees**.

- **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle BCD equals 180 degrees. 
    - We know ∠BCD = 40 degrees.
    - Since BC and CD are chords of the circle, they are equal in length, making triangle BCD an isosceles triangle.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle BFC in triangle ABC, given that F is the intersection of angle bisectors CD and BE, CG is perpendicular to AB, and angle ACG is 32 degrees.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Identify key angles and relationships:**
   - We know that CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB, meaning angle ACD = angle BCD.
   - Similarly, BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, meaning angle ABE = angle CBE.
   - Since CG is perpendicular to AB, angle CGB = 90 degrees.

2. **Apply angle properties:**
   - In triangle ACG, we have angle ACG + angle AGC + angle CAG = 180 degrees (sum of angles in a triangle).
   - Substituting the known values, we get 32 degrees + 90 degrees + angle CAG = 180 degrees.
   - Solving for angle CAG, we get angle CAG = 58 degrees.

3. **Find angle BFC:**
   - Since CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB, angle ACF = angle BCF.
   - In triangle ACF, we have angle ACF + angle CAF + angle CFA = 180 degrees.
   - Substituting the known values, we get angle ACF + 58 degrees + angle CFA = 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, angle ACF + angle CFA = 122 degrees.
   - Similarly, in triangle BCF, we have angle BCF + angle CBF + angle CFB = 180 degrees.
   - Substituting the known values, we get angle BCF + angle CBF + angle CFB = 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, angle BCF + angle CFB = 122 degrees.
   - Since angle ACF = angle BCF, we can conclude that angle CFA = angle CFB.
   - Finally, in triangle CFB, we have angle CFB + angle BFC + angle CBF = 180 degrees.

The image shows a regular pentagon ABCDE inscribed in a circle with center O. We need to find the measure of angle ADE.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Understanding the Properties of Regular Polygons:**
   - A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal.
   - The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees.

2. **Calculating the Measure of Each Interior Angle of the Pentagon:**
   - For a pentagon (n=5), the sum of interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.
   - Since all angles are equal, each interior angle of the pentagon measures 540/5 = 108 degrees.

3. **Identifying the Relationship Between Angle ADE and the Interior Angle of the Pentagon:**
   - Angle ADE is an exterior angle of triangle ADE.
   - The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

4. **Calculating the Measure of Angle ADE:**
   - Angle ADE = Angle AED + Angle EAD.
   - Since triangle ADE is isosceles (AD = AE), Angle AED = Angle EAD.
   - Therefore, Angle ADE = 2 * Angle AED.
   - Angle AED is half of the interior angle of the pentagon, so Angle AED = 108/2 = 54 degrees.
   - Hence, Angle ADE = 2 * 54 = 108 degrees.

## Solution Verification:

- The final answer is **108 degrees**.
- We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of the angles in triangle ADE is 180 degrees.
- Angle ADE = 108 degrees, Angle AED = 54 degrees, and Angle EAD = 54 degrees.
- 108 + 54 + 54 = 216 degrees, which is not equal to 180 degrees. This indicates an error in our calculations.

**Correction:**

- The error lies in assuming that Angle AED is half of the interior angle of the pentagon. This is incorrect because Angle AED is formed by a side of the pentagon and a radius of the circle, not by two sides of the pentagon.
- To find Angle AED, we can use the fact that the central angle subtended by an arc is twice the measure of the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.
- The central angle subtended by arc AE is 360/5 = 72 degrees.
- Therefore, Angle AED = 72/2 = 36 degrees.
- Now, Angle ADE = 2 * Angle AED = 2 * 36 = 72 degrees.

## Final Answer:

The measure of angle ADE is **72 degrees**.

## Verification:

- Angle ADE = 72 degrees, Angle AED = 36 degrees, and Angle EAD = 36 degrees.
- 72 + 36 + 36 = 144 degrees, which is not equal to 180 degrees. This indicates another error in our calculations.

**Final Correction:**

- The error lies in assuming that triangle ADE is isosceles. This is incorrect because AD and AE are radii of the circle, not sides of the pentagon.
- To find Angle ADE, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
- Angle ADE = 180 - Angle AED - Angle EAD.
- Angle AED = 36 degrees (as calculated earlier).
- Angle EAD = 108/2 = 54 degrees (half of the interior angle of the pentagon).
- Therefore, Angle ADE = 180 - 36 - 54 = 90 degrees.

The measure of angle ADE is **90 degrees**.
