643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"<PROBLEM>The Challenge:</PROBLEM>
   * We are trying to find the measure of angle C (∠C) in the circle.  Think of it like a puzzle where we need to figure out the size of one of the angles inside the circle.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Identify Key Relationships**
      * We know that CD is the diameter of the circle, which means it cuts the circle exactly in half. This is important because it tells us that angle COD (∠COD) is a straight angle, measuring 180 degrees.
      * We also know that chord DE is parallel to line segment OA (DE ∥ OA). This means that angle D (∠D) and angle A (∠A) are corresponding angles, and corresponding angles are always equal.

   * **Step 2: Calculate Angle A**
      * Since DE ∥ OA, we know that ∠D = ∠A.  We are given that ∠D = 50 degrees, so ∠A = 50 degrees as well.

   * **Step 3: Calculate Angle COA**
      * We know that ∠COD = 180 degrees.  We also know that ∠A = 50 degrees.  Since ∠COA and ∠A are adjacent angles that make up ∠COD, we can find ∠COA by subtracting: ∠COA = ∠COD - ∠A = 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In our circle, ∠C is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AD.  ∠COA is a central angle that also intercepts arc AD.  Therefore, ∠C = (1/2) * ∠COA = (1/2) * 130 degrees = 65 degrees.

<ANSWER>The Breakthrough:</ANSWER>
   * The degree of ∠C is 65 degrees.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"<PROBLEM>The Challenge:</PROBLEM>
   * We are trying to find the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) of a right triangle. We know the length of one leg (the side opposite the right angle) is 4, and the angle opposite that leg is 60 degrees.  

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio.**  We need to use a trigonometric ratio (sine, cosine, or tangent) to relate the known side (the leg with length 4) to the unknown side (the hypotenuse). Since we know the opposite side and want to find the hypotenuse, we'll use the sine function. 
      * **Formula:**  sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse
   * **Step 2: Substitute the known values.**  We know the angle is 60 degrees and the opposite side is 4.  Let's plug those values into the formula:
      * sin(60°) = 4 / h
   * **Step 3: Solve for h.**  To isolate h, we need to get it out of the denominator. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by h:
      * h * sin(60°) = 4
   * **Step 4: Isolate h.**  Now, divide both sides of the equation by sin(60°) to get h by itself:
      * h = 4 / sin(60°)
   * **Step 5: Calculate the value of sin(60°) and solve for h.**  The sine of 60 degrees is √3 / 2.  Let's substitute that value into our equation:
      * h = 4 / (√3 / 2)
   * **Step 6: Simplify the expression.**  To divide by a fraction, we flip the fraction and multiply:
      * h = 4 * (2 / √3)
      * h = 8 / √3
   * **Step 7: Rationalize the denominator.**  To get rid of the radical in the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by √3:
      * h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
      * h = 8√3 / 3

<ANSWER>The Breakthrough:</ANSWER>
   * The length of the hypotenuse, h, is 8√3 / 3.

   * We are trying to find the measure of angle AOC, which is an angle formed by two radii of the circle that intersect at the center, O.  The problem gives us the measure of angle ABC, which is an inscribed angle of the circle.  Our goal is to use the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles to find the measure of angle AOC.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Understand the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.**
      * An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share the same endpoint on the circle.  In this case, angle ABC is an inscribed angle.
      * A central angle is an angle formed by two radii that share the same endpoint at the center of the circle.  In this case, angle AOC is a central angle.
      * **Important Rule:** The measure of a central angle is always twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.  In other words, if two angles intercept the same arc, the central angle will be twice as big as the inscribed angle.

   * **Step 2: Identify the intercepted arc.**
      * Both angle ABC and angle AOC intercept the same arc, which is arc AC.  This means we can use the rule from Step 1 to find the measure of angle AOC.

   * **Step 3: Apply the rule to find the measure of angle AOC.**
      * Since angle ABC is an inscribed angle and angle AOC is a central angle, and they both intercept arc AC, we know that:
         *  ∠AOC = 2 * ∠ABC
      * We are given that ∠ABC = 70.0 degrees.  Substituting this into the equation, we get:

   * We are trying to find the area of the figure.  The area of a shape is the amount of space it takes up.  Think of it like how much paint you would need to cover the whole shape!  This figure is a bit tricky because it's not a simple rectangle or triangle.  It's actually a combination of both!

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Divide the figure into a rectangle and a triangle.**  Imagine drawing a line straight down from the top right corner of the figure to the bottom.  This creates a rectangle on the left side and a triangle on the right side.
   * **Step 2: Find the area of the rectangle.**  The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length and width.  The length of our rectangle is 48 ft and the width is 41 ft.  So, the area of the rectangle is 48 ft * 41 ft = 1968 square feet.
   * **Step 3: Find the base and height of the triangle.**  The base of the triangle is the bottom side of the figure, which is 53 ft.  The height of the triangle is the difference between the height of the whole figure (48 ft) and the height of the rectangle (41 ft).  So, the height of the triangle is 48 ft - 41 ft = 7 ft.
   * **Step 4: Find the area of the triangle.**  The area of a triangle is found by multiplying its base and height, then dividing by 2.  The base of our triangle is 53 ft and the height is 7 ft.  So, the area of the triangle is (53 ft * 7 ft) / 2 = 185.5 square feet.
   * **Step 5: Add the areas of the rectangle and triangle.**  The total area of the figure is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the triangle.  So, the total area is 1968 square feet + 185.5 square feet = 2153.5 square feet.

   * **Step 1: Visualize the Relationship**
      * Imagine drawing a line segment from point P (the center of the larger circle) to point R (a point on the edge of both circles). This line segment represents the radius of the larger circle, which we know is 4.
      * Now, imagine drawing another line segment from point Q (the center of the smaller circle) to point R. This line segment represents the radius of the smaller circle, which is what we're trying to find.

      * Notice that the line segment PQ is the difference between the radius of the larger circle (PR) and the radius of the smaller circle (QR).  
   * **Step 3:  Applying the Information**
      * We know PR = 4 (the radius of the larger circle).
      * We also know that PQ is half of PR because point Q is the midpoint of line segment PR.
      * Therefore, PQ = PR / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2.
   * **Step 4:  Finding the Radius of the Smaller Circle**
      * Since PQ = 2 and QR is the radius of the smaller circle, we can conclude that the radius of the smaller circle is 2.

   * **Step 1: Analyze the first triangle.**  The numbers are 6, 2, and 2. Let's see if we can find a relationship between them.  If we add the two bottom numbers (6 + 2), we get 8.  Then, if we divide that sum by 2, we get 4.  The top number is 2, which is half of 4.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Identify the relationship between ∠AOD and ∠BOC.**
      *  ∠AOD and ∠BOC are **vertical angles**.  Vertical angles are formed by two intersecting lines and are always equal in measure.
      *  Therefore, since ∠AOD = 70°, we know that ∠BOC = 70° as well.

   * **Step 2: Understand what it means for a ray to bisect an angle.**
      *  A ray that bisects an angle divides it into two equal angles.  
      *  Since OE bisects ∠BOC, it means that ∠BOE = ∠COE.

   * **Step 3: Calculate the measure of ∠BOE (or ∠COE).**
      *  Since ∠BOC = 70° and OE bisects it, we can divide ∠BOC in half: ∠BOE = ∠COE = 70° / 2 = 35°.

   * **Step 4: Identify the relationship between ∠AOE and ∠BOE.**
      *  ∠AOE and ∠BOE are **adjacent angles**.  Adjacent angles share a common vertex and a common side.
      *  The sum of adjacent angles is equal to the measure of the larger angle they form together.  In this case, ∠AOE + ∠BOE = ∠AOB.

   * **Step 5: Calculate the measure of ∠AOB.**
      *  ∠AOB is a **straight angle**, which means it measures 180°.

   * **Step 6: Solve for ∠AOE.**
      *  We know that ∠AOE + ∠BOE = ∠AOB.
      *  We know that ∠BOE = 35° and ∠AOB = 180°.
      *  Therefore, ∠AOE + 35° = 180°.

   * **Step 1:  Understanding Tangent Lines**
      *  The problem tells us that PA and PB are tangent to circle O.  This means that lines PA and PB touch the circle at exactly one point (A and B, respectively).  
      *  A very important rule about tangent lines is that they are always perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency.  This means that angle OAB and angle OBA are both right angles (90 degrees).

      *  Since OA and OB are both radii of the same circle, they have the same length.  We can write this as OA = OB.

   * **Step 4:  Finding the Length of PC**
      *  We know that PA = 8.0.  We also know that PC + CE = PA.
      *  Since CE = DE, we can say that PC + DE = PA.

   * We are trying to find the measure of angle A (∠A) in a triangle.  The problem gives us some information about the angles inside and outside the triangle, and we need to use that information to figure out the missing angle.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1:  Identify the key angles.**
      * We know that ∠DBC = 54°.
      * We also know that CD bisects ∠ACB, meaning it cuts this angle in half.  So, ∠DCB = ∠ACD.
      * We are given that ∠A = ∠ABD.
      * We are also given that BD is perpendicular to CD, which means ∠BDC = 90°.

   * **Step 2:  Find the measure of ∠ACD.**
      * Since CD bisects ∠ACB, we know that ∠ACD = ∠DCB.
      * We also know that ∠ACD + ∠DCB + ∠DBC = 180° (because the angles in a triangle add up to 180°).
      * Substituting the known values, we get: ∠ACD + ∠ACD + 54° = 180°.
      * Combining like terms: 2∠ACD + 54° = 180°.
      * Subtracting 54° from both sides: 2∠ACD = 126°.
      * Dividing both sides by 2: ∠ACD = 63°.

   * **Step 3:  Find the measure of ∠ADB.**
      * We know that ∠ADB + ∠BDC + ∠CDB = 180° (because the angles in a triangle add up to 180°).
      * Substituting the known values, we get: ∠ADB + 90° + 63° = 180°.
      * Combining like terms: ∠ADB + 153° = 180°.
      * Subtracting 153° from both sides: ∠ADB = 27°.

   * **Step 4:  Find the measure of ∠A.**
      * We know that ∠A = ∠ABD.
      * We also know that ∠ABD + ∠ADB + ∠DBC = 180° (because the angles in a triangle add up to 180°).
      * Substituting the known values, we get: ∠A + 27° + 54° = 180°.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Understanding Medians and Midpoints**
      * A median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. In our case, AD is a median because D is the midpoint of BC.
      * A midpoint divides a line segment into two equal parts. Since E is the midpoint of AD, AE and ED are equal in length.

   * **Step 2: Connecting Areas and Ratios**
      * The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between the areas of triangles that share a common base and height. 
      * If two triangles share the same base, their areas are proportional to their corresponding heights. 
      * In our case, triangles ABE and ABC share the same base AB.

   * **Step 3: Finding the Height Ratio**
      * Since E is the midpoint of AD, the height of triangle ABE (from E to AB) is half the height of triangle ABC (from A to BC). 
      * This means the height of triangle ABE is 1/2 the height of triangle ABC.

   * **Step 4: Calculating the Area of Triangle ABC**
      * We know the area of triangle ABE is 2. Since the height of triangle ABE is half the height of triangle ABC, the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle ABE.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1:  Understanding the Pythagorean Theorem**
      * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We can write this as a formula:  a² + b² = c²
      * In our triangle, the hypotenuse is the side with length 15, and the other two sides have lengths 9 and 'x'.  So, we can plug these values into the formula:  9² + x² = 15²

   * **Step 2:  Simplifying the Equation**
      * We need to square the numbers on both sides of the equation: 81 + x² = 225

   * **Step 3:  Isolating the Variable**
      * To get 'x' by itself, we need to subtract 81 from both sides of the equation:  x² = 225 - 81

   * **Step 4:  Solving for x**
      * Now we have x² = 144.  To find 'x', we need to take the square root of both sides of the equation: √x² = √144
      * The square root of x² is simply 'x', and the square root of 144 is 12.  Therefore, x = 12

<ANSWER>The Breakthrough:</ANSWER>
   * The length of the missing side, 'x', is 12.  We can double-check our answer by plugging it back into the Pythagorean Theorem: 9² + 12² = 15²  This simplifies to 81 + 144 = 225, which is true.  Therefore, our answer is correct.

Our goal is to use this information to figure out the length of $JQ$.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Understand the Incenter Property**
      * The incenter of a triangle is a special point that has a very important property: it's the same distance from each side of the triangle.  This means that the distance from $Q$ to line segment $JL$ (which we'll call $QX$) is the same as the distance from $Q$ to line segment $LN$ (which we'll call $QY$) and the distance from $Q$ to line segment $NJ$ (which we'll call $QZ$).
   * **Step 2: Visualize the Key Triangles**
      * Imagine drawing perpendicular lines from point $Q$ to each side of the triangle.  This creates three smaller right triangles: $\triangle QJX$, $\triangle QKY$, and $\triangle QLZ$.  We know that $QX = QY = QZ$ because of the incenter property.
   * **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
      * We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $JQ$.  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In triangle $\triangle QJX$, we know the length of $JX$ (which is 16.5) and we want to find the length of $JQ$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for $JQ$:

      * We need to find the length of $QX$ before we can solve for $JQ$.  We can use the fact that $QX = QY$ and the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $QY$ in triangle $\triangle QKY$.  We know the length of $KY$ (which is 9) and we want to find the length of $QY$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for $QY$:

      * We don't know the length of $QK$, but we can use the fact that $QK = QZ$ and the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $QZ$ in triangle $\triangle QLZ$.  We know the length of $LZ$ (which is the same as $JX$ - 16.5) and we want to find the length of $QZ$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for $QZ$:
         * $QZ^2 + LZ^2 = QL^2$
      * Since $QK = QZ$, we now know the length of $QK$.  We can plug this value back into the equation for $QY^2 + KY^2 = QK^2$ to solve for $QY$.  Since $QX = QY$, we now know the length of $QX$.

      * A perpendicular bisector is a line that cuts a line segment into two equal parts and forms a right angle with the line segment.  In this case, line DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, meaning AD = DB = 3.
   * **Step 2:  Apply the Properties of a Perpendicular Bisector**
      *  A key property of a perpendicular bisector is that any point on the bisector is equidistant from the endpoints of the line segment it bisects.  This means AE = BE.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1:  Understanding Angle Bisectors**
      * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.  So, line segment BE divides angle ABC into two equal angles, and line segment CF divides angle BCD into two equal angles.
   * **Step 2:  Identifying Similar Triangles**
      *  Since BE is an angle bisector of angle ABC, we know that angle ABE is equal to angle CBE.  Similarly, angle DCF is equal to angle BCF.  
      *  Also, angle AEB is equal to angle CED because they are vertical angles.
      *  Therefore, triangles ABE and CDE are similar triangles because they have two corresponding angles that are equal.
   * **Step 3:  Using Proportions in Similar Triangles**
      *  In similar triangles, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.  This means that AB/CD = AE/DE.
      *  Since ABCD is a parallelogram, we know that AB = CD = 3.  We also know that AD = 4.
      *  Therefore, we can write the proportion: 3/3 = AE/DE.  This simplifies to AE = DE.

      *  Since AE = DE and AD = 4, we know that AE = DE = 2.
   * **Step 5:  Using the Angle Bisector Theorem**
      *  The Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.
      *  Applying this to triangle ABC, we have: AE/EC = AB/BC.
      *  We know that AE = 2 and AB = 3.  We also know that BC = AD = 4.

      *  We know that BC = 4 and CD = 3.  We also know that FD = AD - AE = 4 - 2 = 2.

      * Now, we have a right triangle formed by half of the square's side, half of the square's diagonal, and the radius of the circle.

   * **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
      * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
      * In our triangle, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circle, the other two sides are half the side of the square, and the radius of the circle.
      * Let's say the side of the square is 's'.  The diagonal of the square is then 's√2' (using the special relationship between the side and diagonal of a square).  The radius of the circle is half the diameter, so it's 's√2 / 2'.
      * Applying the Pythagorean Theorem: (s√2 / 2)² + (s/2)² = (s√2)²

   * **Step 2: Find the Measure of Arc CD**
      *  Since angle ADC is 26 degrees, and it's an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CD, we can use the relationship between inscribed angles and intercepted arcs:

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Understanding Inscribed Angles**
      *  The problem mentions that ⊙O is the circumscribed circle of the quadrilateral. This means that all four corners of the quadrilateral touch the circle.  
      *  An important rule in geometry is that an inscribed angle (an angle formed by two chords of a circle that share the same endpoint on the circle) is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Identify the key angles.**  We know that AB is parallel to CD and BC is parallel to DE. This means we have pairs of parallel lines, which will help us find the missing angles.
   * **Step 2: Use the properties of parallel lines.**  When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal (a line that crosses them), we have special angle relationships.  
      * **Corresponding angles are equal.**  This means that if we have two parallel lines, the angles in the same position relative to the transversal are equal.  For example, ∠A and ∠C are corresponding angles because they are both on the same side of the transversal and in the same position relative to the parallel lines.
      * **Alternate interior angles are equal.**  These are angles that are on opposite sides of the transversal and inside the parallel lines.  For example, ∠A and ∠D are alternate interior angles.
   * **Step 3: Find the measure of ∠D.**  Since AB is parallel to CD, and ∠A and ∠C are corresponding angles, we know that ∠D = ∠A = 45°.
   * **Step 4: Find the measure of ∠E.**  Since BC is parallel to DE, and ∠C and ∠E are alternate interior angles, we know that ∠E = ∠C = 110°.
   * **Step 5: Use the angle sum property of triangles.**  The angles inside any triangle always add up to 180°.  So, in triangle AED, we have: ∠AED + ∠A + ∠D = 180°.
   * **Step 6: Substitute the known angle measures.**  We know that ∠A = 45° and ∠D = 45°.  Substituting these values into the equation, we get: ∠AED + 45° + 45° = 180°.

   * **Step 2: Understand the Relationship Between Areas and Bases**
      * The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height.
      * In both triangles ACD and ABD, they share the same height (the perpendicular distance from point A to line BC). 
      * This means that the ratio of their areas is directly proportional to the ratio of their bases.

   * **Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Bases**
      * The base of triangle ACD is DC, which is 1 unit long.
      * The base of triangle ABD is BD, which is 2 units long.
      * The ratio of their bases is BD/DC = 2/1 = 2.

   * **Step 4: Apply the Ratio to Areas**
      * Since the ratio of the bases is 2, the ratio of the areas of triangles ABD and ACD is also 2.

      * We have a triangle with some special properties: a midpoint, an angle bisector, and a perpendicular line.  Our goal is to use these properties to find the length of AC.
   * **Step 2:  Using the Angle Bisector Theorem**
      * The Angle Bisector Theorem states that if a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.
      * In our triangle, AM bisects angle BAC.  This means that AB/AC = BM/MC.
   * **Step 3:  Finding BM**
      * We know that BM is perpendicular to AM, and we are given that MN = 2.  This means that triangle BMN is a right triangle with MN as one leg and BM as the other leg.
      * We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find BM: BM² + MN² = BN².

      * For now, let's just focus on finding BM: BM² + 2² = (BC/2)².
   * **Step 4:  Finding MC**
      * We know that N is the midpoint of BC, so BN = NC.  This means that MC = BC/2 - MN.
   * **Step 5:  Substituting into the Angle Bisector Theorem**
      * Now we can substitute the values we found for BM and MC into the Angle Bisector Theorem: AB/AC = BM/(BC/2 - MN).
      * We know AB = 8 and MN = 2, so we have 8/AC = BM/(BC/2 - 2).

      * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  In our triangle, OB is the hypotenuse, OA is one leg, and AB is the other leg.  We can write this as:  OB² = OA² + AB²
   * **Step 3:  Plug in the Known Values**
      * We know that OB = 10 and AB = 8.  Let's plug these values into our equation:  10² = OA² + 8²
   * **Step 4:  Solve for OA (the radius)**

   * **Step 1: Draw a radius from the center of the circle (O) to point B.**  This is important because it creates a right triangle within the circle.  We know that the radius of the circle is 2, so this line segment OB has a length of 2.

   * **Step 2: Recognize that angle COB is twice the measure of angle CAB.** This is a key property of inscribed angles in a circle.  Since angle C is 30 degrees, angle COB is 60 degrees.

      * The problem tells us that triangle ABC is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around point A. This means that every point in the triangle is moved 90 degrees in a clockwise direction, with point A acting as the center of the rotation.
      * Imagine you're holding a compass and spinning it 90 degrees to the right. That's what's happening to the triangle!

   * **Step 2: Visualize the Rotated Triangle**
      * After the rotation, we get a new triangle called AB′C′.  Since the rotation is 90 degrees, the sides of the original triangle are now perpendicular to the corresponding sides of the rotated triangle.
      * For example, side AB is now perpendicular to side AB′.

      *  Also, because of the rotation, ∠ABC and ∠AB′C′ are congruent (they have the same measure).

   * **Step 5: Apply Angle Relationships**
      *  We know that the angles inside a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  Let's look at triangle AB′C′:
         * ∠AB′C′ + ∠B′AC′ + ∠AC′B′ = 180 degrees
      *  We know ∠B′AC′ is 90 degrees.  We also know that ∠AB′C′ is congruent to ∠ABC, which is 90 degrees - 32 degrees = 58 degrees.
      *  Now we can substitute these values into the equation:

      * The angle addition postulate states that the measure of a larger angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its smaller adjacent angles.  In this case, we can use this to find the measure of angle OCD:
         * ∠DCB = ∠OCD + ∠OCB
         * 40° = ∠OCD + 90°
         * ∠OCD = 40° - 90° = -50°

      * Since angle COB is a central angle, its measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, the measure of arc CB is equal to the measure of angle COB.

      *  Since angle ABC is 60 degrees, arc AC must be 120 degrees (60 x 2 = 120).

   * **Step 2:  Finding the Measure of Arc CD**
      *  A circle has 360 degrees.  We know that arc AC is 120 degrees.  The rest of the circle, which is arc CD, must be 240 degrees (360 - 120 = 240).

   * **Step 3:  Understanding Central Angles**
      *  A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle.  In our problem, angle COD is a central angle because its vertex is at point O, the center of the circle.
      *  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  This means that angle COD is also 240 degrees.

   * **Step 4:  Finding the Measure of Angle CDE**
      *  Angle CDE is an exterior angle of triangle CDO.  An exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
      *  The two non-adjacent interior angles to angle CDE are angle CDO and angle DCO.  We know that angle COD is 240 degrees, and since angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, angle CDO and angle DCO must add up to 120 degrees (180 - 240 = -120, but we take the absolute value).
      *  Since triangle CDO is isosceles (CO = DO because they are both radii of the circle), angle CDO and angle DCO are equal.  Therefore, each of these angles is 60 degrees (120 / 2 = 60).
      *  Finally, we can find the measure of angle CDE by adding angle CDO and angle DCO: 60 + 60 = 120 degrees.

   * We are given an isosceles triangle ABC, where AB = BC.  The lengths of the sides are expressed as algebraic expressions with a variable 'x'.  Our goal is to find the length of side AC, which is represented by the expression 4x + 1.  To do this, we need to figure out the value of 'x' first.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1:  Recognize the Properties of Isosceles Triangles**
      * An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length.  In this case, AB = BC.
      * This means the expressions representing AB and BC must be equal to each other: 9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5

   * **Step 2:  Solve for 'x'**
      * To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.  Let's start by getting all the 'x' terms on the left side:
         * 9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5
         * 9x - 5x = -0.5 + 1 
         * 4x = 0.5

      * Now, divide both sides of the equation by 4 to get 'x' by itself:
         * 4x / 4 = 0.5 / 4
         * x = 0.125

   * **Step 3:  Substitute the Value of 'x' into the Expression for AC**
      * We know that AC = 4x + 1.  Now that we know x = 0.125, we can substitute it into the expression:
         * AC = 4(0.125) + 1
         * AC = 0.5 + 1

   * **Step 1: Understand the Relationship Between Side Length and Area of an Equilateral Triangle**
      *  An equilateral triangle has all sides equal. Let's call the side length of an equilateral triangle 's'.
      *  The area of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula: Area = (√3 / 4) * s² 
      *  This formula tells us that the area of an equilateral triangle is directly proportional to the square of its side length.

   * **Step 2: Find the Side Lengths of the Known Equilateral Triangles**
      *  We know the area of triangle A'BC is 10. Let's use the formula to find its side length (s1):
         *  10 = (√3 / 4) * s1²
         *  s1² = (10 * 4) / √3 
         *  s1 = √((40 / √3)) 
      *  Similarly, we know the area of triangle AB'C is 4. Let's find its side length (s2):
         *  4 = (√3 / 4) * s2²
         *  s2² = (4 * 4) / √3
         *  s2 = √((16 / √3))

   * **Step 3: Recognize the Relationship Between the Side Lengths of the Equilateral Triangles and the Sides of the Right Triangle**
      *  Notice that the side length of triangle A'BC (s1) is equal to the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABC.
      *  The side length of triangle AB'C (s2) is equal to the side BC of the right triangle ABC.
      *  The side length of triangle ABC' (s3) is equal to the side AC of the right triangle ABC.

   * **Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
      *  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (s1²) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (s2² + s3²).
      *  We know s1 and s2, so we can find s3:
         *  s1² = s2² + s3²
         *  (40 / √3) = (16 / √3) + s3²
         *  s3² = (40 / √3) - (16 / √3)
         *  s3² = 24 / √3
         *  s3 = √(24 / √3)

   * **Step 5: Calculate the Area of Triangle ABC'**
      *  Now that we know the side length of triangle ABC' (s3), we can use the area formula:
         *  Area of ABC' = (√3 / 4) * s3²
         *  Area of ABC' = (√3 / 4) * (24 / √3)

      * The angle ∠DCF is given as 20.0 degrees.

   * **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In our case, ∠DCF is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc DF.
      * Therefore, the measure of arc DF is twice the measure of ∠DCF:  arc DF = 2 * 20.0 = 40.0 degrees.

   * **Step 1: Identify the key relationship.**  We know that ABDC is a rectangle.  This is important because rectangles have special properties that will help us solve the problem.  One key property is that all four angles in a rectangle are right angles, which means they each measure 90 degrees.

   * **Step 2:  Focus on the relevant angles.**  We are given that m∠1 = 38 degrees.  We also know that angle 1 and angle 2 are adjacent angles, meaning they share a common side (line segment AD).

So, we can write this equation:  m∠BAD = m∠1 + m∠2

   * **Step 4:  Substitute known values.**  We know that m∠BAD = 90 degrees (because it's a right angle in the rectangle) and m∠1 = 38 degrees.  Let's plug those values into our equation:  90 = 38 + m∠2

   * **Step 5:  Solve for m∠2.**  To isolate m∠2, we need to subtract 38 from both sides of the equation:  90 - 38 = 38 + m∠2 - 38.  This simplifies to 52 = m∠2.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1:  Recognize the Key Property**
      *  In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This means that line segment AC (one of the diagonals) is perpendicular to line segment BD (the other diagonal) and they intersect at point O, which is the midpoint of both diagonals.
   * **Step 2:  Visualize the Triangles**
      *  Focus on triangle AEF.  Since E and F are midpoints, line segment EF is a midsegment of triangle AEF.

      *  We know that AC = 6, and since O is the midpoint of AC, then AO = 1/2 * AC = 1/2 * 6 = 3.
      *  Triangle AOF is a right triangle (because the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular).  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find AF:  AF² = AO² + OF²
      *  We need to find OF.  Since O is the midpoint of BD, then OF = 1/2 * BD.  To find BD, we can use the fact that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.  This means that triangle AOB is a right triangle, and we can use the Pythagorean Theorem:  AB² = AO² + BO²
      *  We know AB = 5 and AO = 3, so BO² = AB² - AO² = 5² - 3² = 16.  Therefore, BO = 4.
      *  Since O is the midpoint of BD, then BD = 2 * BO = 2 * 4 = 8.

   * **Step 2: Apply the Theorem to our Triangle**
      * Let's call the missing side ""x"".  We need to make sure that:

   * **Step 1: Find the side length of the square.**
      * We know the area of the square is 1.  The area of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself (side * side).  
      * So, to find the side length, we need to find the square root of the area.  The square root of 1 is 1.

      * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal parts. So, angle ABO is equal to angle CBO, and angle ACO is equal to angle BCO.
   * **Step 2: Applying the Angle Sum Property of a Triangle**
      * The sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.  Therefore, in triangle ABC:
         * ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
         * 110° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°

         * ∠BOC = 180° - ∠OBC - ∠OCB 
   * **Step 4: Using the Angle Bisector Property**
      * Since OB and OC are angle bisectors:
         * ∠OBC = (1/2)∠ABC
         * ∠OCB = (1/2)∠ACB

      * We know that ∠B + ∠C = 70°.  Substituting the angle bisector information:

         * ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 140°
   * **Step 6: Solving for ∠BOC**
      * Now we can substitute the values we've found back into the equation for ∠BOC:
         * ∠BOC = 180° - ∠OBC - ∠OCB

      * We're dealing with a quadrilateral (ABCD) and a triangle (AMN) inside it.  The goal is to find the smallest perimeter of the triangle.
      * The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides.  To minimize the perimeter, we need to minimize the lengths of the sides AM, MN, and NA.

   * **Step 2:  Finding the Optimal Positions of M and N**
      * Imagine point M moving along line BC.  As M moves closer to point B, the length of AM decreases, but the length of MN increases.  Similarly, as M moves closer to point C, the length of AM increases, but the length of MN decreases.
      * The same logic applies to point N moving along line CD.
      * To minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, we need to find the positions of M and N where the sum of the lengths AM + MN + NA is the smallest.
      * This happens when AM and AN are perpendicular to BC and CD respectively.  This is because if they are not perpendicular, we can always find a shorter path by moving M or N closer to the perpendicular position.

   * **Step 3:  Using Geometry to Find the Angles**

      * Therefore, ∠BAM = 180° - ∠AMB - ∠ABM = 180° - 90° - 330° = -240°.  Again, since angles cannot be negative, we know that ∠BAM = 360° - 240° = 120°.

   * We are trying to find the value of 'x' in the equation (2x - 27)°.  This equation represents the measure of angle KJH, which is an angle formed by two chords inside a circle.  To find 'x', we need to use the relationship between inscribed angles and their intercepted arcs.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Identify the intercepted arc.**  Angle KJH intercepts arc KH.  This means that arc KH is the part of the circle that lies inside angle KJH.

   * **Step 2: Understand the relationship between inscribed angles and their intercepted arcs.**  A very important rule in geometry states that the measure of an inscribed angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc.  In other words, angle KJH is half the size of arc KH.

   * **Step 3: Find the measure of arc KH.**  We know that angle GJH is 83°.  Since angle GJH is also an inscribed angle that intercepts arc KH, we can use the rule from Step 2 to find the measure of arc KH:
      *  Measure of arc KH = 2 * measure of angle GJH = 2 * 83° = 166°

   * **Step 4: Set up an equation to solve for 'x'.**  We know that arc KH is 166° and that angle KJH is (2x - 27)°.  Using the rule from Step 2, we can set up an equation:
      *  (2x - 27)° = 1/2 * 166°

   * **Step 5: Solve for 'x'.**  Now we have a simple equation to solve:
      *  (2x - 27)° = 83°
      *  2x = 83° + 27°
      *  2x = 110°

   * **Step 1: Set up an equation.** Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, we can set the expressions for any two sides equal to each other. Let's use sides QR and QS:
      *  4x = 6x - 1 
   * **Step 2: Solve for 'x'.**  To isolate 'x', we need to get all the 'x' terms on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other.
      * Subtract 4x from both sides: 
         * 4x - 4x = 6x - 1 - 4x
         * 0 = 2x - 1
      * Add 1 to both sides:

      * We need to figure out how these angles are related to each other.

   * **Step 2: Apply the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem.**
      * This theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.
      * In our diagram, the angle (4x + 50)° is formed by a tangent and a chord.  The intercepted arc is the entire circle, which has a measure of 360°.
      * Therefore, we can write the equation: (4x + 50)° = (1/2) * 360°

   * **Step 3: Simplify the equation.**
      * (4x + 50)° = 180°

   * **Step 4: Solve for x.**
      * Subtract 50° from both sides: 4x = 130°

   * **Step 5: Verify the solution.**
      * Substitute x = 32.5° back into the original angle expressions to make sure they make sense.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Visualize the Center of Mass**
      * Imagine the triangle is a flat piece of cardboard.  The center of mass is the point where you could put your finger and have the triangle perfectly balanced.  Since it's a symmetrical triangle, we know the center of mass will lie along the line of symmetry (the vertical line in the middle).
   * **Step 2: Divide the Triangle into Smaller Shapes**
      * We can divide the triangle into two smaller right triangles by drawing a horizontal line across the middle.  Each of these smaller triangles is also an isosceles right triangle.
   * **Step 3: Find the Center of Mass of Each Smaller Triangle**
      * The center of mass of each smaller triangle will be located at a distance of 1/3 of the height of the triangle from its base.  This is a general rule for right triangles.
   * **Step 4: Calculate the Distance from the Base of the Larger Triangle to the Center of Mass of Each Smaller Triangle**
      * Since the height of the larger triangle is 'a', the height of each smaller triangle is 'a/2'.  Therefore, the distance from the base of the larger triangle to the center of mass of each smaller triangle is (1/3)*(a/2) = a/6.
   * **Step 5: Find the Average Distance**
      * The center of mass of the entire triangle will be located at the average distance of the centers of mass of the two smaller triangles.  Since both smaller triangles have their centers of mass at a distance of a/6 from the base, the average distance is also a/6.

   * We are trying to find the total resistance between points 'a' and 'b' in this infinite chain of resistors. Imagine you're trying to send electricity from point 'a' to point 'b' - how much resistance would it encounter along the way?

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1:  Visualize the Pattern**
      * Notice that the circuit repeats itself.  We have a section of resistors on the top and a matching section on the bottom, and this pattern continues infinitely.
   * **Step 2:  Simplify the Circuit**
      * Let's focus on the first section of the circuit.  We can simplify it by combining resistors that are in series and in parallel.
      * **Series Resistors:** Resistors in series are connected end-to-end, so the current flows through them one after the other.  To find the total resistance of resistors in series, we simply add their individual resistances.
      * **Parallel Resistors:** Resistors in parallel are connected side-by-side, so the current can flow through multiple paths.  To find the total resistance of resistors in parallel, we use the formula: 1/R_total = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + ...
   * **Step 3:  Combine the Top Resistors**
      * The three resistors on the top are in series.  Their total resistance is R + R + R = 3R.
   * **Step 4:  Combine the Bottom Resistors**
      * The three resistors on the bottom are also in series.  Their total resistance is R + R + R = 3R.
   * **Step 5:  Combine the Top and Bottom Resistors**
      * Now we have two resistors (3R each) in parallel.  Using the formula for parallel resistors:
         * 1/R_total = 1/3R + 1/3R = 2/3R
         * R_total = 3R/2
   * **Step 6:  The Infinite Loop**
      *  The simplified section we just calculated (3R/2) is now in series with the rest of the infinite chain.  But wait!  The rest of the chain is exactly the same as the original circuit!  This means the total resistance of the infinite chain is equal to the resistance of the simplified section plus the resistance of the original chain.
      *  Let's call the total resistance of the infinite chain 'X'.  We can write this as an equation:
         * X = (3R/2) + X
   * **Step 7:  Solve for X**
      *  Subtract X from both sides:
         * 0 = (3R/2)
      *  This equation doesn't make sense!  It means the total resistance is zero, which can't be true for an infinite chain of resistors.  The problem is that we assumed the total resistance of the infinite chain was finite.  This assumption is incorrect.
   * **Step 8:  The Infinite Resistance**
      *  Since we can't solve for a finite value of X, it means the total resistance of the infinite chain is infinite.  This makes sense because the current would have to flow through an infinite number of resistors, encountering resistance at every step.

<ANSWER>The Breakthrough:</ANSWER>
   * The resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is infinite.  This is because the circuit repeats infinitely, and the current would encounter an infinite number of resistors.

But we don't know the lengths of the sides yet!  We only know that the rectangle is made up of two identical squares, and that each square has an area of 9.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Find the side length of each square.**
      * We know the area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself:  Area = side * side.
      * We are given that the area of each square is 9.  So, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 9.
      * That number is 3, because 3 * 3 = 9.
      * Therefore, each side of the square is 3 units long.

   * **Step 2: Determine the dimensions of the rectangle.**
      * The rectangle is made up of two squares side-by-side.
      * This means the width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square, which is 3 units.
      * The length of the rectangle is equal to the side lengths of two squares put together, which is 3 + 3 = 6 units.

The diagram shows a circle with a triangle inside it.  The angles of the triangle are labeled as 3x degrees, (5x-12) degrees, and a third angle that we don't know yet.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1:  Understanding the Relationship**
      * The key to solving this problem is understanding a rule about angles in circles.  When a triangle is inscribed in a circle (meaning all three points of the triangle touch the circle), the angle formed by two points on the circle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.  
      * In our diagram, the central angle is the whole angle formed at the center of the circle.  We don't know its measure, but we know that the angle at point 'E' (3x degrees) is half of it.

   * **Step 2:  Finding the Central Angle**
      * Since the angle at 'E' is half the central angle, we can double it to find the central angle: 3x * 2 = 6x degrees.

   * **Step 3:  Finding the Third Angle of the Triangle**
      * We know that the angles inside a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  We know two angles of the triangle: 3x degrees and (5x-12) degrees.  To find the third angle, we can use this equation:
         * 3x + (5x - 12) + Third Angle = 180
      * Combining like terms:
         * 8x - 12 + Third Angle = 180
      * Isolating the Third Angle:
         * Third Angle = 180 - 8x + 12
         * Third Angle = 192 - 8x

   * **Step 4:  Using the Central Angle Rule Again**
      * Now we know all three angles of the triangle.  We also know that the central angle is 6x degrees.  The central angle intercepts the same arc as the angle at point 'C' (5x-12 degrees).  This means the angle at 'C' is half the central angle:
         * (5x - 12) = 6x / 2
         * (5x - 12) = 3x

   * **Step 5:  Solving for x**
      * Now we have a simple equation to solve for 'x':
         * 5x - 12 = 3x
         * 5x - 3x = 12
         * 2x = 12

   * We are trying to find the measure of the minor arc AC, which is represented by the variable 'x'.  This means we need to figure out how many degrees are in that part of the circle.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Understand the Relationship**
      * The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between an inscribed angle and its intercepted arc.  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share the same endpoint on the circle.  The intercepted arc is the part of the circle that lies inside the angle.
      * **Rule:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

   * **Step 2: Identify the Inscribed Angle and Intercepted Arc**
      * In our problem, angle ABC is the inscribed angle.  It's formed by chords AB and BC, which share endpoint B on the circle.
      * The intercepted arc for angle ABC is arc AC.

   * **Step 3: Apply the Rule**
      * We know that the measure of angle ABC is 70 degrees.  Since angle ABC is an inscribed angle, its measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc, arc AC.
      * So, we can set up an equation:  70° = (1/2) * x

   * **Step 4: Solve for x**
      * To isolate 'x', we need to get rid of the (1/2) on the right side of the equation.  We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
         * 2 * 70° = 2 * (1/2) * x
         * 140° = x

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Identify Key Relationships**
      *  We know that AB is the diameter of the circle, which means that angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.
      *  We also know that DB and DC are tangents to the circle. This means that they form right angles with the radius at the points of tangency (∠DBO and ∠DCO are both 90 degrees).

   * **Step 2: Apply Angle Properties**
      *  Since ∠ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) and ∠ACE is given as 25 degrees, we can find ∠BCE:
         * ∠BCE = ∠ACB - ∠ACE = 90° - 25° = 65°

   * **Step 3: Utilize Tangent-Radius Relationship**
      *  We know that ∠DBO is a right angle (90 degrees) and ∠BCE is 65 degrees.  Since angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find ∠BDC:
         * ∠BDC = 180° - ∠DBO - ∠BCE = 180° - 90° - 65° = 25°

   * **Step 4:  Final Calculation**
      *  Finally, we can find ∠D by recognizing that ∠BDC and ∠D are supplementary angles (they add up to 180 degrees):
         * ∠D = 180° - ∠BDC = 180° - 25° = 155°

      * We have a square (ABCD) and a semicircle (with diameter AD).  Remember, a square has four right angles (90 degrees each).
   * **Step 2:  Angles in a Semicircle**
      *  A very important rule is that any angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle (90 degrees).  This means angle ∠CAD is 90 degrees.
   * **Step 3:  Tangents and Radii**
      *  The line segment CT is a tangent to the semicircle.  This means it touches the semicircle at only one point (point T).  A key rule is that a tangent line is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  So, angle ∠CTT is 90 degrees.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Identify Key Relationships**
      *  We know that AB is the diameter of the circle, which means it cuts the circle exactly in half.  This is important because it tells us that angle AOB is a straight angle, measuring 180 degrees.
      *  We also know that angle ABD is 50 degrees.

   * **Step 2:  Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
      * The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  
      * In our case, angle ABD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AD.  This means that the measure of arc AD is twice the measure of angle ABD, or 2 * 50 degrees = 100 degrees.

   * **Step 3:  Find the Measure of Arc BC**
      * Since arc AD and arc BC together make up the entire circle, and a circle has 360 degrees, we can find the measure of arc BC by subtracting the measure of arc AD from 360 degrees: 360 degrees - 100 degrees = 260 degrees.

   * **Step 4:  Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem Again**

   * **Step 2: Understand the relationship between arcs and central angles.**  A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle.  The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  In this case, the central angle that intercepts arc PQR is angle PSQ.
   * **Step 3:  Apply the relationship to find the measure of angle PSQ.** Since the measure of arc PQR is 98 degrees, the measure of angle PSQ is also 98 degrees.
   * **Step 4:  Recognize that angle PSQ is a straight angle.** A straight angle measures 180 degrees.  We can see that angle PSQ is a straight angle because it forms a straight line.
   * **Step 5:  Use the information to find the measure of angle PSQ.**  We know that angle PSQ is a straight angle, which means it measures 180 degrees.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1:  Identify Key Angles**
      * We know that CG is perpendicular to AB, which means angle CGB is a right angle (90 degrees).
      * We are given that angle ACG is 32 degrees.
      * Since angles ACG and GCB form a straight line, they are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle GCB = 180 degrees - 32 degrees = 148 degrees.

   * **Step 2:  Apply the Angle Bisector Property**
      * CD is the angle bisector of angle ACB. This means it divides angle ACB into two equal angles: angle ACD and angle BCD.
      * Since angle GCB is 148 degrees, and CD bisects it, angle BCD = 148 degrees / 2 = 74 degrees.

      * In triangle BFC, we know angle BCF is 74 degrees (from step 2).

   * We are trying to find the measure of angle ADE.  This means we need to figure out how many degrees are in that specific angle within the pentagon.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Understanding the Basics**
      * We know that a regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles.
      * The center of the pentagon, point O, is also the center of the circle that goes around it (the ""circumcircle"").
      *  Since the pentagon is regular, all the lines drawn from the center to the vertices (corners) of the pentagon are equal in length.

   * **Step 2: Finding the Central Angle**
      * Imagine dividing the pentagon into five equal slices, like a pizza. Each slice represents one of the pentagon's angles.
      * The central angle of each slice is the angle formed at the center of the circle (point O).
      * To find the central angle, we use the formula:  Central Angle = (360 degrees) / (number of sides)
      * In this case, the central angle is (360 degrees) / (5 sides) = 72 degrees.

   * **Step 3: Connecting the Dots**
      * Now, let's focus on triangle AOD.  We know that OA and OD are radii of the circle, so they are equal in length.
      * This means triangle AOD is an isosceles triangle (two sides are equal).
      * In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.  So, angle OAD = angle ODA.

   * **Step 4:  Putting it Together**
      * The angles inside triangle AOD add up to 180 degrees.
      * We know angle AOD is 72 degrees (from Step 2).
      * Therefore, angle OAD + angle ODA = 180 degrees - 72 degrees = 108 degrees.
      * Since angle OAD = angle ODA, each of these angles is 108 degrees / 2 = 54 degrees.

   * **Step 5:  The Final Step**
      * Angle ADE is made up of angle ODA (which we found to be 54 degrees) and angle ODE (which is half of the central angle, 72 degrees / 2 = 36 degrees).
      * So, angle ADE = 54 degrees + 36 degrees = 90 degrees.

   * We need to find the value of 'y'.  The problem tells us that 'y' is equal to the square of 'x'.  To find 'y', we first need to figure out what 'x' is.  We can do this by using the fact that the angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.

<SOLUTION>Unlocking the Solution:</SOLUTION>
   * **Step 1: Identify the angles.** We have three angles around the point where the line segments meet: 'x', 'y', and 70 degrees.
   * **Step 2: Apply the angle sum property.** The sum of all angles around a point is 360 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + y + 70 = 360
   * **Step 3: Simplify the equation.**  Combine the constant terms: x + y = 290
   * **Step 4: Substitute the relationship between x and y.** We know that y = x².  Substitute this into the equation: x + x² = 290
   * **Step 5: Rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation.**  Subtract 290 from both sides to get: x² + x - 290 = 0
   * **Step 6: Factor the quadratic equation.**  Find two numbers that add up to 1 (the coefficient of the x term) and multiply to -290 (the constant term). These numbers are 17 and -16. So, we can factor the equation as: (x + 17)(x - 16) = 0
   * **Step 7: Solve for x.** For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. So, either x + 17 = 0 or x - 16 = 0. Solving these equations, we get x = -17 or x = 16.
   * **Step 8: Choose the valid solution for x.** Since angles cannot be negative, we discard x = -17. Therefore, x = 16.
