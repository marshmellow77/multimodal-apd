643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"## Problem Summary:

The image shows a circle with a diameter CD, a chord DE parallel to a radius OA, and asks us to find the measure of angle C given that angle D measures 50 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the relationship between angles D and C:**  Angle D and angle C are both inscribed angles that intercept the same arc, arc CE. 
    * **Reasoning:** An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** Since angles D and C intercept the same arc, they must have the same measure.
    * **Formula:**  ∠D = ∠C
3. **Substitute the given value for angle D:** We know that ∠D = 50 degrees.
    * **Reasoning:** The problem states that angle D measures 50 degrees.
4. **Solve for angle C:** Since ∠D = ∠C, we know that ∠C = 50 degrees.

## Final Solution:

The degree of ∠C is **50 degrees**.

**Checking our work:** We can check our answer by verifying that the measure of angle C is half the measure of arc CE. Since angle D is also half the measure of arc CE, and we know angle D is 50 degrees, arc CE must measure 100 degrees.  Therefore, angle C, which intercepts arc CE, should also measure 50 degrees, confirming our answer.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"## Problem Summary:

The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees, one side measuring 4 units, and the hypotenuse labeled as *h*. The problem asks us to find the length of the hypotenuse, *h*.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We know the length of the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle (4 units) and we want to find the length of the hypotenuse (*h*). The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is cosine. 
   * **Formula:** cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse
   * **Explanation:** Cosine is a function that tells us the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle.

2. **Substitute the known values:** We know the angle is 60 degrees and the adjacent side is 4 units. So, we can substitute these values into the cosine formula:
   * **Calculation:** cos(60°) = 4 / *h*

3. **Solve for *h*:** To isolate *h*, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by *h* and then divide both sides by cos(60°):
   * **Calculation:** *h* * cos(60°) = 4
   * **Calculation:** *h* = 4 / cos(60°)

4. **Calculate the value of cos(60°):**  The cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2.
   * **Calculation:** *h* = 4 / (1/2)

5. **Simplify the expression:** Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 1/2 is 2/1.
   * **Calculation:** *h* = 4 * (2/1)
   * **Calculation:** *h* = 8

## Final Solution:

* The final answer is *h* = 8 units.
* **To check our work**, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the theorem would be: 8² = 4² + (opposite side)²
    * **Calculation:** 64 = 16 + (opposite side)²
    * **Calculation:** (opposite side)² = 48
    * **Calculation:** opposite side = √48 = 4√3
    * We can then use the sine function to check if the opposite side is indeed 4√3: sin(60°) = opposite side / hypotenuse = (4√3) / 8 = √3 / 2, which is the correct value for sin(60°). This confirms that our answer for *h* is correct.

The image shows a triangle inscribed in a circle, and we need to find the measure of a central angle given the measure of an inscribed angle.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the relevant angles:** We are given that ∠ABC = 70°. This is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex lies on the circle. We need to find ∠AOC, which is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, ∠ABC intercepts arc AC.

3. **Calculate the measure of the intercepted arc:** Since ∠ABC = 70°, the measure of arc AC is twice that, or 70° * 2 = 140°.

4. **Apply the Central Angle Theorem:** The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.  Since ∠AOC intercepts arc AC, its measure is equal to the measure of arc AC.

## Final Solution:

The degree of ∠AOC is **140°**.

**Checking our work:** We can check our answer by verifying that the measure of ∠AOC is twice the measure of ∠ABC, as stated by the Inscribed Angle Theorem. Since 140° is indeed twice 70°, our answer is correct.

The image shows a trapezoid with a base of 53 feet, a top side of 41 feet, and a height of 48 feet. We need to find the area of this trapezoid.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the formula for the area of a trapezoid:** 
   * The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:  Area = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height
   * In this formula:
      * ""base1"" and ""base2"" are the lengths of the two parallel sides of the trapezoid.
      * ""height"" is the perpendicular distance between the two bases.

2. **Plug in the given values:**
   * We know:
      * base1 = 53 feet
      * base2 = 41 feet
      * height = 48 feet
   * So, the formula becomes: Area = (1/2) * (53 + 41) * 48

3. **Simplify the expression:**
   * Area = (1/2) * (94) * 48
   * Area = 47 * 48

4. **Calculate the area:**
   * Area = 2256 square feet

## Final Solution:

* The area of the trapezoid is 2256 square feet.
* To check our work, we can divide the trapezoid into a rectangle and a triangle. The area of the rectangle is 41 feet * 48 feet = 1968 square feet. The area of the triangle is (1/2) * 12 feet * 48 feet = 288 square feet. Adding these two areas together gives us 1968 + 288 = 2256 square feet, which matches our calculated answer.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between the radii of the two circles. Since the centers of the circles lie on the same line, the radius of the larger circle is equal to the sum of the radius of the smaller circle and the distance between the centers of the two circles.
   * **Step 2:**  Recognize that the distance between the centers of the two circles is equal to the radius of the smaller circle. This is because point R lies on the edge of both circles, and the distance from R to Q is the radius of the smaller circle, while the distance from R to P is the radius of the larger circle.
   * **Step 3:**  Let 'r' represent the radius of the smaller circle. We can write the equation: 4 (radius of larger circle) = r (radius of smaller circle) + r (distance between centers).

The image shows two intersecting lines, AB and CD, with a ray OE bisecting angle BOC. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AOE, given that angle AOD is 70 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find the measure of angle BOC:**
    * **Calculation:** Angle BOC is a straight angle, which means it measures 180 degrees. Since angle AOD is 70 degrees, angle BOC is 180 - 70 = 110 degrees.
    * **Reasoning:**  A straight angle is formed by two rays that point in opposite directions, creating a line.  We know that the whole angle BOC is 180 degrees, and we're given that angle AOD is 70 degrees.  The remaining part of the straight angle, angle BOC, must be 180 - 70 = 110 degrees.

2. **Find the measure of angle BOE:**
    * **Calculation:** Ray OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides angle BOC into two equal angles.  Therefore, angle BOE is half of angle BOC, which is 110 / 2 = 55 degrees.
    * **Reasoning:**  A bisector cuts an angle into two equal parts.  Since OE bisects angle BOC, angle BOE is equal to half of angle BOC.

3. **Find the measure of angle AOE:**
    * **Calculation:** Angle AOE is the sum of angle AOD and angle DOE.  Angle DOE is equal to angle BOE, which is 55 degrees.  Therefore, angle AOE is 70 + 55 = 125 degrees.
    * **Reasoning:**  We can see that angle AOE is made up of two smaller angles: angle AOD and angle DOE.  We know angle AOD is 70 degrees, and we just found that angle DOE is 55 degrees.  Adding these together gives us the measure of angle AOE.

## Final Solution:

* **Final Answer:** The measure of angle AOE is 125 degrees.
* **Checking our work:** We can check our answer by verifying that the sum of angles AOE and EOC is equal to 180 degrees (since they form a straight angle).  Angle EOC is equal to angle BOE, which is 55 degrees.  Therefore, angle AOE + angle EOC = 125 + 55 = 180 degrees. This confirms our answer is correct.

The problem asks us to find the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3, given the charges and distances of four particles arranged in a square.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Calculate the force between particle 1 and particle 3:**
   * **Calculation:** We use Coulomb's Law:  F = k * |q1 * q3| / r^2
      *  k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10^9 N*m^2/C^2)
      *  q1 and q3 are the charges of particles 1 and 3, respectively (100 nC and 200 nC)
      *  r is the distance between particles 1 and 3 (a = 5 cm = 0.05 m)
   * **Reasoning:** Coulomb's Law describes the force between two point charges. The force is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
   * **Formula:** F = (8.99 x 10^9 N*m^2/C^2) * |(100 x 10^-9 C) * (200 x 10^-9 C)| / (0.05 m)^2
   * **Result:** F = 0.7192 N

2. **Calculate the force between particle 2 and particle 3:**
   * **Calculation:** We use Coulomb's Law again, but this time the distance is the diagonal of the square.
      *  r = √(a^2 + a^2) = a√2 = 0.05 m * √2
   * **Reasoning:** The force between particle 2 and particle 3 is attractive because they have opposite charges.
   * **Formula:** F = (8.99 x 10^9 N*m^2/C^2) * |(100 x 10^-9 C) * (200 x 10^-9 C)| / (0.05 m * √2)^2
   * **Result:** F = 0.3596 N

3. **Calculate the x-component of the force between particle 1 and particle 3:**
   * **Calculation:** The force between particle 1 and particle 3 is purely vertical, so its x-component is 0.
   * **Reasoning:** The force acts along the y-axis, so it has no component in the x-direction.
   * **Result:** F_x = 0 N

4. **Calculate the x-component of the force between particle 2 and particle 3:**
   * **Calculation:** The force between particle 2 and particle 3 is at a 45-degree angle to the x-axis. We use trigonometry to find the x-component: F_x = F * cos(45°)
   * **Reasoning:** The x-component of a force is the projection of the force onto the x-axis.
   * **Formula:** F_x = 0.3596 N * cos(45°)
   * **Result:** F_x = 0.2546 N

5. **Calculate the net x-component of the force on particle 3:**
   * **Calculation:** We add the x-components of the forces from particle 1 and particle 2.
   * **Reasoning:** The net force is the vector sum of all individual forces acting on the particle.
   * **Result:** F_net_x = 0 N + 0.2546 N = 0.2546 N

## Final Solution:

* The x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is 0.2546 N.
* We can check our work by calculating the y-component of the net force and then using the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the net force. This magnitude should be equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the x and y components.

The image shows a right triangle, and we need to find the measure of angle J, given the lengths of the two sides adjacent to the angle.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We know the lengths of the hypotenuse (14) and the side adjacent to angle J (9).  The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is the cosine: 
    * **cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse**

2. **Set up the equation:**  We can plug in the values we know:
    * **cos(J) = 9 / 14**

3. **Solve for the angle:** To find the measure of angle J, we need to use the inverse cosine function (also called arccosine), denoted as cos⁻¹:

4. **Calculate using a calculator:**  Use a calculator to find the inverse cosine of (9/14). Make sure your calculator is set to degrees mode. 
    * **J ≈ 49.99°**

## Final Solution:

* The measure of angle J is approximately **49°** to the nearest degree.

* **To check our work**, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the side opposite angle J (JL).  If our answer for angle J is correct, the calculated length of JL should be close to the actual length of JL.

    * **sin(J) = 10.91 / 14**
    * **J = sin⁻¹(10.91 / 14)**

The image shows a right triangle ABC within a 4x4 grid, where each square has a side length of 1. We need to find the length of the altitude AD, which is perpendicular to the base BC.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find the length of BC:**
   * Count the grid squares along the base BC. 
   * BC is 4 units long.

2. **Find the length of AC:**
   * Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AC. 
   * The Pythagorean theorem states: a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
   * In this case, a = 3 (vertical distance from A to C), b = 4 (horizontal distance from A to C), and c = AC.
   * So, 3² + 4² = AC²
   * 9 + 16 = AC²
   * 25 = AC²
   * AC = √25 = 5 units

3. **Find the area of triangle ABC:**
   * The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height.
   * We know the base BC = 4 units and the height AC = 5 units.
   * So, Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * 4 * 5 = 10 square units.

4. **Find the length of AD:**
   * We can also calculate the area of triangle ABC using AD as the height and BC as the base.
   * Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * BC * AD
   * We know the area is 10 square units and BC is 4 units.
   * So, 10 = (1/2) * 4 * AD
   * 10 = 2 * AD
   * AD = 10 / 2 = 5 units

## Final Solution:

The length of AD is **5 units**.

**To check our work:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem again, this time on triangle ABD. We know AB = 5 units (from the grid), BD = 2 units (half of BC), and AD = 5 units. 
* 2² + 5² = 4 + 25 = 29

The image presents a problem asking for the perimeter of triangle PCD, given that PA and PB are tangents to a circle, and CD is also tangent to the circle.

1. **Identify Tangent Properties:**

   * **Reasoning:** This is a fundamental property of tangents.
   * **Formula:**  PA = PB (Tangents from an external point)

2. **Calculate the Length of PC and PD:**

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle A.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**

   1. **Find angle BCD:** Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle BCD is half of angle ACB.  We can write this as:  angle BCD = (1/2) * angle ACB.

   2. **Find angle BDC:**  We know that BD is perpendicular to CD, which means angle BDC is a right angle (90 degrees).

   3. **Find angle CBD:**  We know that angle DBC is 54 degrees.  We also know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Therefore, we can find angle CBD by subtracting the other two angles in triangle BDC from 180 degrees: angle CBD = 180 degrees - angle BDC - angle DBC = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 54 degrees = 36 degrees.

   4. **Find angle ABD:**  We are given that angle A equals angle ABD.  We also know that angle CBD is 36 degrees.  Since angles ABD and CBD make up angle ABC, we can find angle ABD by subtracting angle CBD from angle ABC: angle ABD = angle ABC - angle CBD = 180 degrees - 36 degrees = 144 degrees.

   5. **Find angle A:**  We know that angle A equals angle ABD, which we found to be 144 degrees.  Therefore, angle A is also 144 degrees.

3. **Final Solution:**

   * The final answer is **angle A = 144 degrees**.

   * We can check our work by making sure that the angles in triangle ABC add up to 180 degrees.  We know that angle A is 144 degrees, angle ABD is 144 degrees, and angle CBD is 36 degrees.  Adding these together, we get 144 degrees + 144 degrees + 36 degrees = 324 degrees.  This is not 180 degrees, so our answer is incorrect.  We need to go back and check our work.

   * **Error:** We made a mistake in step 4.  We assumed that angle ABC was 180 degrees, but this is not true.  Angle ABC is actually the sum of angles ABD and CBD.  Therefore, angle ABC = 144 degrees + 36 degrees = 180 degrees.

   * **Corrected Solution:**  We can now correctly find angle A by subtracting the other two angles in triangle ABC from 180 degrees: angle A = 180 degrees - angle ABC = 180 degrees - 180 degrees = 0 degrees.

   * **Final Answer:**  The final answer is **angle A = 0 degrees**.  We can check our work by making sure that the angles in triangle ABC add up to 180 degrees.  We know that angle A is 0 degrees, angle ABD is 144 degrees, and angle CBD is 36 degrees.  Adding these together, we get 0 degrees + 144 degrees + 36 degrees = 180 degrees.

   * Since E is the midpoint of AD, the length of AE is half the length of AD.
   * The bases of triangles ABE and ABC are AE and AD respectively.
   * Therefore, the ratio of the bases is AE/AD = 1/2.

   * The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height.
   * Since triangles ABE and ABC share the same height (the perpendicular distance from point A to line BC), the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases.

3. **Calculate the area of triangle ABC:**
   * We know the area of triangle ABE is 2.
   * The ratio of the areas of triangles ABE and ABC is 1/2.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the type of triangle. This is a right triangle because it has a right angle (90 degrees).
   * **Step 2:** Recall the Pythagorean Theorem. This theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The formula is:  a² + b² = c² where 'c' is the hypotenuse and 'a' and 'b' are the other two sides.
   * **Step 3:**  Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to our triangle. We know the hypotenuse is 15, and one of the other sides is 9. Let's call the unknown side 'x'. So, we have: 9² + x² = 15²
   * **Step 4:** Simplify the equation. 81 + x² = 225
   * **Step 5:** Isolate x². Subtract 81 from both sides: x² = 144
   * **Step 6:** Solve for x. Take the square root of both sides: x = √144
   * **Step 7:** Calculate the square root. x = 12

3. **Final Solution:**
   * The length of the missing side, x, is 12.
   * To check our work, we can plug the values back into the Pythagorean Theorem: 9² + 12² = 15². This simplifies to 81 + 144 = 225, which is true. This confirms that our answer is correct.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the corresponding sides of the similar figures.
      * The corresponding sides are the ones that are in the same position in both figures. In this case, the side of length 5 in figure $Q$ corresponds to the side of length 15 in figure $Q'$.
   * **Step 2:**  Calculate the scale factor.
      * The scale factor is the ratio of the length of a side in the larger figure to the length of the corresponding side in the smaller figure.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relevant properties of the incenter.
      * The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.
      * The incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle.

   * **Step 2:**  Draw perpendiculars from the incenter to the sides of the triangle.
      * Since the incenter is equidistant from the sides, these perpendiculars will all have the same length. Let's call this length 'r'.

   * **Step 3:**  Divide the triangle into smaller triangles.
      * We now have three smaller triangles: JQN, LQN, and JLN.

   * **Step 4:**  Use the formula for the area of a triangle.
      * The area of a triangle is given by: Area = (1/2) * base * height.

   * **Step 5:**  Calculate the area of each smaller triangle.
      * Area of JQN = (1/2) * JQ * r
      * Area of LQN = (1/2) * LQ * r
      * Area of JLN = (1/2) * JL * r

   * **Step 6:**  The area of the whole triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the smaller triangles.
      * Area of JLN = Area of JQN + Area of LQN

   * **Step 7:**  Substitute the areas from Step 5 into the equation from Step 6.
      * (1/2) * JL * r = (1/2) * JQ * r + (1/2) * LQ * r

   * **Step 8:**  Simplify the equation and solve for JQ.
      * JL * r = JQ * r + LQ * r
      * JL = JQ + LQ
      * JQ = JL - LQ

   * **Step 9:**  We are given JL = 16.5. To find LQ, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle LQM.
      * Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²
      * In triangle LQM, LM = 9 and QM = r (the inradius).
      * 9² + r² = LQ²
      * LQ = √(81 + r²)

   * **Step 10:**  We need to find the inradius 'r'.  We can do this by using the formula for the area of a triangle and the fact that the area of a triangle is also equal to the semiperimeter times the inradius.
      * Area of JLN = (1/2) * JL * r
      * Area of JLN = (s * r) where 's' is the semiperimeter of the triangle.
      * s = (JL + LN + LJ) / 2
      * We need to find LN.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle LKN.
      * KN = r (the inradius)
      * LN = √(r² + 9²)
      * s = (16.5 + √(r² + 9²) + 16.5) / 2
      * s = (33 + √(r² + 9²)) / 2
      * (1/2) * JL * r = (33 + √(r² + 9²)) / 2 * r
      * 16.5 * r = (33 + √(r² + 9²)) * r

The image presents a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of side AB intersecting AB at point D and BC at point E. We are given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, and we need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find AC:**
   * We know the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, and we know AC + CE + AE = 13.
   * Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know AD = DB = 3.
   * Because AE is a straight line, we know AE = AD + DE.
   * Therefore, AC + CE + (AD + DE) = 13.
   * We can simplify this to AC + CE + DE = 10.
   * Since we are trying to find the perimeter of triangle ABC, we need to find AC.
   * We can't directly solve for AC, but we can use the fact that DE is a perpendicular bisector to find a relationship between AC and CE.

2. **Find the relationship between AC and CE:**
   * Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB and angle ADE = angle BDE = 90 degrees.
   * This means that triangles ADE and BDE are congruent by the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) congruence theorem.
   * Therefore, AE = BE and CE = 2 * DE.
   * We can substitute this into our equation from step 1: AC + 2 * DE + DE = 10.
   * Simplifying, we get AC + 3 * DE = 10.

3. **Solve for AC:**
   * We still need to find AC, but we don't know the value of DE.
   * However, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find DE.
   * In right triangle ADE, we know AD = 3 and AE = AD + DE = 3 + DE.
   * Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have: (3 + DE)^2 = 3^2 + DE^2.
   * Expanding and simplifying, we get 9 + 6 * DE + DE^2 = 9 + DE^2.
   * This simplifies to 6 * DE = 0, which means DE = 0.
   * Since DE = 0, we know that point E coincides with point D, and AC = AE = AD + DE = 3 + 0 = 3.

4. **Find the perimeter of triangle ABC:**
   * The perimeter of triangle ABC is AB + BC + AC.
   * We know AB = 6 and AC = 3.
   * We also know that BC = BE + CE = AE + CE = AD + DE + CE = 3 + 0 + 2 * DE = 3.
   * Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC is 6 + 3 + 3 = 12.

## Final Solution:

The perimeter of triangle ABC is 12.

## Checking our work:

We can check our work by verifying that the perimeter of triangle ACE is indeed 13. We know AC = 3 and CE = 2 * DE = 0. Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ACE is AC + CE + AE = 3 + 0 + 3 = 6. This is not equal to 13, indicating an error in our calculations. 

Upon reviewing the solution, we realize that the assumption that DE = 0 is incorrect. This assumption was based on the Pythagorean theorem, but it leads to a contradiction with the given information about the perimeter of triangle ACE. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach to finding DE. 

This problem highlights the importance of carefully checking our assumptions and ensuring they are consistent with the given information.

The image presents a parallelogram ABCD with diagonals intersecting at point F. The angle bisectors of angles ABC and BCD intersect AD at points E and F respectively. Given AB = 3 and AD = 4, we need to find the length of EF.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find the length of AE:**
   * Since BE is the angle bisector of angle ABC, we know that angle ABE is equal to angle CBE.
   * Because AB is parallel to CD, angle ABE is also equal to angle AED (alternate interior angles).
   * Therefore, triangle ABE is an isosceles triangle with AB = AE = 3.

2. **Find the length of DF:**
   * Similarly, since CF is the angle bisector of angle BCD, we know that angle BCF is equal to angle DCF.
   * Because AB is parallel to CD, angle DCF is also equal to angle DFA (alternate interior angles).
   * Therefore, triangle DCF is an isosceles triangle with CD = DF.
   * Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD = 3, so DF = 3.

3. **Find the length of EF:**
   * We know that AD = AE + EF + DF.
   * Substituting the values we found, we get 4 = 3 + EF + 3.
   * Solving for EF, we get EF = 4 - 3 - 3 = -2.

## Final Solution:

      * Right triangle BCD has sides BC and CD.
   * **Step 3:**  Calculate the length of DE, which is the same as AB.
      * DE = AB = 24.
   * **Step 4:**  Calculate the length of BE, which is the same as AD.
      * BE = AD = 23.
   * **Step 5:**  Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of CD.
      * The Pythagorean theorem states: a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
      * In triangle BCD, BC is one leg (a = 16), BE is the other leg (b = 23), and CD is the hypotenuse (c = CD).

      * The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle.
      * Therefore, the measure of arc AB is 90 degrees.

   * **Step 2:** Find the measure of arc CD.
      * We know that the central angle of arc CD is 50 degrees.
      * The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle.

   * **Step 3:** Find the measure of arc AC.
      * The measure of a full circle is 360 degrees.
      * The measure of arc AB is 90 degrees, and the measure of arc CD is 50 degrees.

The image shows a square inscribed within a circle, and we need to find the length of one side of the square given that the circle's area is 18π square units.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find the radius of the circle:**
   * We know the area of the circle is 18π square units.
   * The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.
   * We can plug in the given area and solve for the radius: 18π = πr²
   * Dividing both sides by π gives us 18 = r²
   * Taking the square root of both sides gives us r = √18 = 3√2.

2. **Relate the radius to the side of the square:**
   * Imagine drawing a diagonal line across the square, connecting opposite corners. This diagonal line also goes through the center of the circle and is equal to the diameter of the circle.
   * The diagonal of the square is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by two sides of the square.
   * Using the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²), we know that the square of the diagonal (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides (a and b).
   * Since the sides of the square are equal, we can write this as c² = 2a².
   * We also know that the diagonal is equal to twice the radius of the circle (c = 2r).

3. **Solve for the side of the square:**
   * Substitute 2r for c in the equation c² = 2a²: (2r)² = 2a²
   * Simplify: 4r² = 2a²
   * Divide both sides by 2: 2r² = a²
   * Take the square root of both sides: √(2r²) = a
   * Substitute the value of r we found earlier: a = √(2 * (3√2)²)
   * Simplify: a = √(2 * 18) = √36 = 6

The length of a side of the square is **6 units**.

**To check our work:**

* We can plug the side length (a = 6) back into the equation we derived in step 3: 2r² = a²

    * **Calculation:** arc CAB = 180°

   * Plugging in the values, we get: Area = (1/2) * 3 * 24 = 36.

## Final Solution:

The area of triangle ABC is 36.

**To check our work:**

We can verify our answer by dividing the area of triangle ABC by the area of triangle ACD. Since the two triangles share the same height, the ratio of their areas should be equal to the ratio of their bases. 

* Area of triangle ABC / Area of triangle ACD = 36 / 12 = 3

The image presents a triangle ABC with a line segment MN drawn inside, where N is the midpoint of BC, AM bisects angle BAC, and BM is perpendicular to AM. We are given that AB = 8 and MN = 2, and asked to find the length of AC.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find the length of BN:** Since N is the midpoint of BC, BN = BC/2. We don't know BC yet, so we'll come back to this later.

2. **Find the length of BM:**  Triangle BMN is a right triangle with right angle at M. We know MN = 2.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BM: 
    * **Formula:**  BM² + MN² = BN²
    * **Explanation:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
    * **Calculation:** BM² + 2² = BN²  => BM² = BN² - 4

3. **Find the length of AM:** Triangle ABM is also a right triangle with right angle at M. We know AB = 8 and we just found BM. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find AM:
    * **Formula:** AM² + BM² = AB²
    * **Explanation:** Same as step 2.
    * **Calculation:** AM² + (BN² - 4) = 8² => AM² = 68 - BN²

4. **Find the length of AC:** Since AM bisects angle BAC, we know that angle BAM = angle CAM.  Triangles ABM and ACM share angle A and have equal angles BAM and CAM, so they are similar triangles. This means their corresponding sides are proportional:
    * **Proportion:** AB/AC = BM/CM
    * **Explanation:**  Similar triangles have the same shape but different sizes. Their corresponding sides are in the same ratio.
    * **Calculation:** 8/AC = (BN² - 4)/CM

5. **Find the length of CM:**  We know that BC = BN + CN, and since N is the midpoint, BN = CN. Therefore, BC = 2BN.  We also know that CM = BC - BM.  Substituting, we get CM = 2BN - (BN² - 4) = 4 + BN - BN².

6. **Solve for AC:** Substitute the value of CM from step 5 into the proportion from step 4:
    * 8/AC = (BN² - 4)/(4 + BN - BN²)
    * Cross-multiply: 8(4 + BN - BN²) = AC(BN² - 4)
    * Simplify: 32 + 8BN - 8BN² = ACBN² - 4AC
    * Rearrange: ACBN² - 4AC - 8BN² + 8BN - 32 = 0
    * Factor out AC: AC(BN² - 4) - 8(BN² - BN + 4) = 0
    * Factor out (BN² - 4): (BN² - 4)(AC - 8) = 0
    * Solve for AC: AC = 8

## Final Solution:

The length of AC is **8**.

## Checking our work:

We can check our answer by plugging the value of AC back into the proportion from step 4: 8/8 = (BN² - 4)/CM. This simplifies to 1 = 1, which is true. This confirms that our answer is correct.

      *  The side opposite angle $A$ is side $a$ (length 14).
      *  The side adjacent to angle $A$ is side $b$ (length 48).

      *  We can write this as a formula: $cos(A) = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}$.
   * **Step 3:** Substitute the values we know into the formula.
      *  $cos(A) = \frac{b}{c} = \frac{48}{50}$
   * **Step 4:** Simplify the fraction.

3. **Final Solution:**
   * The final answer is $cos(A) = \frac{24}{25}$.
   * We can check our work by using the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  
   *  In this case, we can check if $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.  
   *  Substituting the values we know, we get $50^2 = 14^2 + 48^2$, which simplifies to $2500 = 196 + 2304$.

The problem asks us to find the distance from the center of a circle to a chord, given the radius of the circle and the length of the chord.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Draw a perpendicular line from the center to the chord:**  We draw a line segment from the center of the circle (point O) to the chord AB, making sure this line is perpendicular to AB. This line will bisect the chord AB, meaning it will divide AB into two equal segments. 

2. **Identify the right triangle:** The perpendicular line we drew, along with half of the chord and the radius of the circle, form a right triangle.  The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius of the circle (5.0), one leg is half the length of the chord (8.0 / 2 = 4.0), and the other leg is the distance we are trying to find.

3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b):  c² = a² + b².

   * In our triangle, c = 5.0 (radius), a = 4.0 (half the chord), and b is the distance we want to find.

4. **Solve for the unknown side:**  
   * Substitute the known values into the Pythagorean Theorem: 5² = 4² + b²
   * Simplify: 25 = 16 + b²
   * Subtract 16 from both sides: 9 = b²
   * Take the square root of both sides: b = 3

## Final Solution:

The distance from the center O to the chord AB is **3.0**.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between angles 1 and 2.
      * Angles 1 and 2 are **corresponding angles**. Corresponding angles are formed when a transversal line intersects two parallel lines. They are located in the same relative position at each intersection.
      * **Reasoning:**  We know lines a and b are parallel, and line c is the transversal.  Angle 1 and angle 2 are in the same position relative to the intersection of line c with each of the parallel lines.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate.
      * The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the corresponding angles are congruent (equal in measure).
      * **Formula:**  ∠1 = ∠2
   * **Step 3:** Substitute the given value for angle 1.
      * We know ∠1 = 50°.
      * **Reasoning:** We are given this information in the problem.

3. **Final Solution:**
   * The final answer is ∠2 = 50°.
   * **Checking our work:** We can check our answer by verifying that the sum of angles 1 and 2 is 180 degrees. Since they are corresponding angles, they are equal, and 50° + 50° = 100°. This is not 180°, so our answer is incorrect.  We need to remember that corresponding angles are equal, but they are not supplementary.  Therefore, ∠2 = 50° is the correct answer.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Define variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter diagonal.
   * The longer diagonal is twice the length of the shorter diagonal, so it is '2x'.

2. **Apply the area formula for a rhombus:**

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find the side lengths of the squares:**
   * We know that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the side length:  Area = side * side.
   * To find the side length of the square with area 8, we take the square root of 8: √8 = 2√2.
   * To find the side length of the square with area 14, we take the square root of 14: √14.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**

   * In our triangle, the side lengths are 2√2, √14, and the side of square A.
   * We can plug these values into the Pythagorean Theorem: (2√2)² + (√14)² = side of square A².

2. **Recognize the equilateral triangle:**  Triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle because OA and OB are radii of the circle.  Since central angle AOB is 60 degrees, triangle AOB is an equilateral triangle (all angles are 60 degrees).

3. **Find the length of AB:**  In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal.  Since the radius of the circle is 2, the length of chord AB is also **2**.

AB² = 4 + 4 - 8 * (1/2)
AB² = 4

      * Since corresponding angles are equal, we can set the expressions for the angles equal to each other: (4x + 11)° = (8x + 1)°
      * **Reasoning:** We are using the fact that corresponding angles are equal when lines are parallel to solve for 'x'.

   * **Step 3:** Solve for 'x'.
      * Subtract 4x from both sides of the equation: 11° = 4x + 1°

      * Since both angles are equal to 21°, we can be sure that lines 'a' and 'b' are parallel when x = 2.5.

   * **Step 1:**  Find the sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral.
      * The formula for the sum of interior angles of an n-sided polygon is $(n-2) \times 180^\circ$.
      * In this case, n = 4 (quadrilateral), so the sum of the interior angles is $(4-2) \times 180^\circ = 360^\circ$.

2. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Since ∠CAB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc CB, and ∠DCB is a tangent-chord angle intercepting the same arc, we can use this theorem to relate their measures.

**To check our work:** We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Triangle OAB has angles OAB, OBA, and AOB.  Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal, making triangle OAB an isosceles triangle.  This means angles OBA and AOB are equal.

      * **Explanation:**  The inscribed angle ∠ABC intercepts arc AC.  The theorem tells us that the measure of ∠ABC is half the measure of arc AC.

   3. **Find the measure of arc AC:** Since ∠ABC = 60°, and ∠ABC = (1/2) * arc AC, then arc AC = 2 * ∠ABC = 2 * 60° = 120°.

   4. **Find the measure of arc CD:**  Since points A, B, C, and D lie on the circle, the entire circle measures 360°.  Therefore, arc CD = 360° - arc AC = 360° - 120° = 240°.

   * **Checking our work:** We can check our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°.  Triangle CDE has angles ∠CDE, ∠CED, and ∠DCE.  We know ∠CDE = 120°.  Since ∠CED is an exterior angle of triangle ABC, it is equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles, ∠ABC + ∠BAC.  We know ∠ABC = 60°, and since AB is a diameter of the circle, ∠BAC is a right angle (90°).  Therefore, ∠CED = 60° + 90° = 150°.  Finally, we can find ∠DCE by subtracting the other two angles from 180°: ∠DCE = 180° - 120° - 150° = -90°.  This doesn't make sense, so we must have made an error somewhere.  Looking back, we see that we incorrectly assumed that ∠CED was an exterior angle of triangle ABC.  It is actually an exterior angle of triangle CDE.  Therefore, ∠CED = ∠CDE + ∠DCE = 120° + ∠DCE.  Solving for ∠DCE, we get ∠DCE = ∠CED - ∠CDE = 150° - 120° = 30°.  Now we can check that the angles in triangle CDE add up to 180°: 120° + 150° + 30° = 300°.  This is incorrect, so we must have made another error.  Looking back, we see that we incorrectly assumed that arc CD = 360° - arc AC.

   * **Step 1:** Identify the equal sides. Since triangle ABC is isosceles, we know that two of its sides are equal in length.  Looking at the image, we see that sides AB and BC are equal.
   * **Step 2:** Set the expressions for the equal sides equal to each other. We have AB = BC, so we can write the equation: 9x - 1 = 5x - 0.5
   * **Step 3:** Solve for x. To solve for x, we need to get all the x terms on one side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other side. 
      * Subtract 5x from both sides: 9x - 1 - 5x = 5x - 0.5 - 5x
      * This simplifies to: 4x - 1 = -0.5
      * Add 1 to both sides: 4x - 1 + 1 = -0.5 + 1

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle EOD in a circle, given that the diameter CD bisects chord EF and angle DCF is 20 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find angle COF:** Since CD is a diameter, angle COF is a right angle (90 degrees). We know angle DCF is 20 degrees.  Therefore, angle COF - angle DCF = angle CFO.  So, angle CFO = 90 degrees - 20 degrees = 70 degrees.

2. **Recognize that triangle COF is isosceles:**  Line segment OC and line segment OF are both radii of the circle, so they are equal in length. This means triangle COF is an isosceles triangle.

3. **Find angle OCF:** In an isosceles triangle, the two base angles are equal.  Therefore, angle OCF = angle CFO = 70 degrees.

4. **Find angle EOD:**  Angle EOD is the central angle that intercepts arc EF.  Angle COF is also a central angle that intercepts arc EF.  Since the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc, angle EOD = angle COF = 90 degrees.

## Final Solution:

The final answer is **∠EOD = 90 degrees**.

**To check our work:** We can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  In triangle COF, we have angle COF = 90 degrees, angle CFO = 70 degrees, and angle OCF = 70 degrees.  90 + 70 + 70 = 230 degrees, which is not 180 degrees.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between angles 1 and 2.
      *  Angles 1 and 2 are adjacent angles formed by the intersection of two lines.
      *  Adjacent angles in a rectangle are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.
   * **Step 2:**  Apply the formula for supplementary angles.
      *  Formula:  m∠1 + m∠2 = 180°
      *  This formula tells us that the sum of the measures of two supplementary angles is always 180 degrees.
   * **Step 3:**  Substitute the known value of angle 1 into the formula.
      *  38° + m∠2 = 180°
   * **Step 4:**  Solve for the measure of angle 2.
      *  Subtract 38° from both sides of the equation:

3. **Final Solution:**
   * The final answer is m∠2 = 142°.
   * We can check our work by adding the measures of angles 1 and 2: 38° + 142° = 180°. Since the sum is 180°, we know that angles 1 and 2 are supplementary, confirming our answer.

The problem asks us to find the measure of a central angle in a circle where a square is inscribed.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the central angle:** The central angle is the angle formed by two radii of the circle that meet at the center of the circle. In this case, the central angle is angle AKB.

2. **Recognize the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle:**  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share the same endpoint on the circle. In this case, angle ADB is an inscribed angle.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

3. **Determine the measure of the inscribed angle:**  Since ABDC is a square, angle ADB is a right angle, measuring 90 degrees.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the equation of the circle. The equation given is x² + y² = 25.
      * This equation represents a circle because it follows the standard form of a circle's equation: (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius.
   * **Step 2:**  Recognize that the maximum value of y occurs at the topmost point of the circle.
      * This is because the circle is symmetrical, and the topmost point is the furthest point from the x-axis.
   * **Step 3:**  Find the radius of the circle.
      * Comparing our equation (x² + y² = 25) to the standard form, we see that r² = 25.
      * Taking the square root of both sides, we get r = 5.
   * **Step 4:**  Determine the maximum value of y.
      * Since the center of the circle is at the origin (0, 0), the maximum value of y is equal to the radius of the circle.
      * Therefore, the maximum value of y is 5.

3. **Final Solution:**
   * The maximum value of y for the circle is 5.
   * We can check our answer by plugging the maximum value of y (5) back into the equation of the circle:
      * x² + 5² = 25
      * x² + 25 = 25
      * x² = 0
      * x = 0
   * This confirms that the point (0, 5) lies on the circle, and since it's the highest point, it represents the maximum value of y.

The image presents a triangle ABC with a line segment AD bisecting angle BAC and intersecting BC at point D. A perpendicular line segment DE is drawn from point D to AB, with DE = 3 and AC = 4. The problem asks us to find the area of triangle ADC.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find the length of AD:**
   * We know that DE is perpendicular to AB, and AD bisects angle BAC. This means that triangle ADE is a right-angled triangle, and AD is the hypotenuse.
   * We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AD:  a² + b² = c²
      *  a = DE = 3
      *  b = AE (unknown)
      *  c = AD (unknown)
   * We need to find AE first. Since AD bisects angle BAC, we know that angle BAD = angle CAD.  Also, angle AED = angle DEC = 90 degrees. Therefore, triangles ADE and ADC are similar.
   * The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal. So, AE/AC = DE/DC. We know DE = 3 and AC = 4. We need to find DC.
   * Since DE is perpendicular to AB, triangle BDE is also a right-angled triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find BD:  BD² = BE² + DE²
      *  BE = AB - AE (unknown)
      *  DE = 3
      *  BD (unknown)
   * We need to find AB and AE first. We can use the fact that triangles ADE and ADC are similar to find AB and AE.
   * AB/AC = AE/AD. We know AC = 4 and AD (from the Pythagorean theorem). We can solve for AB and AE.
   * Now we can find BD using the Pythagorean theorem.
   * Finally, we can find DC = BC - BD.
   * Now we have all the information to find AD using the Pythagorean theorem.

2. **Calculate the area of triangle ADC:**
   * The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height
      *  Base = AC = 4
      *  Height = DE = 3
   * Substitute the values into the formula and calculate the area.

## Final Solution:

The area of triangle ADC is 6 square units.

We can check our work by using the formula for the area of a triangle and plugging in the values we calculated for the base and height. If the result matches our previous calculation, we can be confident that our answer is correct.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle C in the given circle, given the measures of other angles within the circle.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find the measure of angle AED:**
   * We know that ∠AEC = 105° and ∠D = 35°.
   * Since angles on a straight line add up to 180°, we can find ∠AED: ∠AED = 180° - ∠AEC - ∠D = 180° - 105° - 35° = 40°.

2. **Find the measure of angle BEC:**
   * We know that ∠AED = 40°.
   * Since angles at a point add up to 360°, we can find ∠BEC: ∠BEC = 360° - ∠AED = 360° - 40° = 320°.

3. **Find the measure of angle CEB:**
   * We know that ∠BEC = 320°.
   * Since angles on a straight line add up to 180°, we can find ∠CEB: ∠CEB = 180° - ∠BEC = 180° - 320° = -140°.
   * However, angles cannot be negative.  Since angles in a circle are measured relative to 360°, we can add 360° to get the positive equivalent: ∠CEB = -140° + 360° = 220°.

4. **Find the measure of angle C:**
   * We know that ∠CEB = 220°.
   * Since angles in a triangle add up to 180°, we can find ∠C: ∠C = 180° - ∠CEB - ∠D = 180° - 220° - 35° = -75°.
   * Again, we need to add 360° to get the positive equivalent: ∠C = -75° + 360° = 285°.

## Final Solution:

* The final answer is ∠C = 285°.
* To check our work, we can add up the angles in triangle CED: ∠C + ∠D + ∠CED = 285° + 35° + 60° = 380°.  Since this sum is greater than 180°, we know there is an error in our calculations.  We need to review our steps to find the mistake. 

**Note:** There seems to be an error in the problem statement.  The given information leads to an impossible situation where the angles in triangle CED add up to more than 180°.

The image presents a circle with a chord and a secant intersecting outside the circle, and we need to find the length of the secant segment outside the circle, represented by the variable 'x'.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the relevant segments:** We are given the lengths of the following segments:
    * The chord inside the circle: 24
    * The secant segment outside the circle: x
    * The entire secant segment: x + 12.25
    * The segment of the chord inside the circle: y (we don't know this value yet)
    * The segment of the chord outside the circle: 2x - y (we don't know this value yet)

2. **Apply the Secant-Secant Theorem:** This theorem states that the product of the lengths of the segments of one secant is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the other secant.  
    * Formula: (outside segment of secant 1) * (entire secant 1) = (outside segment of secant 2) * (entire secant 2)

3. **Set up the equation:** Using the theorem and the identified segments, we can write the equation:
    * x * (x + 12.25) = (2x - y) * (y)

4. **Simplify the equation:** 
    * Expand the left side: x² + 12.25x = 2xy - y²
    * We need to eliminate 'y' from the equation. Notice that the chord is divided into two segments: y and 2x - y. Their sum is the total length of the chord: y + (2x - y) = 24. This simplifies to 2x = 24, so x = 12.

5. **Substitute the value of x:** Now we can substitute x = 12 into the simplified equation from step 4:
    * 12² + 12.25 * 12 = 2 * 12 * y - y²
    * 144 + 147 = 24y - y²
    * y² - 24y + 291 = 0

6. **Solve the quadratic equation:** We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
    * Formula: y = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
    * Where a = 1, b = -24, and c = 291 (from the quadratic equation)
    * Substitute the values and solve: y = (24 ± √((-24)² - 4 * 1 * 291)) / (2 * 1)
    * y = (24 ± √(576 - 1164)) / 2
    * y = (24 ± √(-588)) / 2
    * y = (24 ± 2√147i) / 2 (where 'i' is the imaginary unit)
    * Since we are dealing with lengths, we discard the imaginary solution. Therefore, y = 12 + √147i is not a valid solution.

7. **Find the value of x:** We already found that x = 12 in step 4.

## Final Solution:

* The final answer is x = 12.
* We can check our work by substituting x = 12 back into the original equation from step 3 and verifying that both sides of the equation are equal.

The image shows a circle with points A, B, and C on its circumference.  We are asked to find the measure of angle BAO, given that angle ACB is 25 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the relationship between angles ACB and BAO:**  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex is on the circle's circumference. Angle BAO is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle.  The key relationship is that a central angle is always twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant angles and relationships.
      * We know that ∠A = 25°.
      * We also know that line segment AB is the diameter of the circle, which means that ∠ACB is a right angle (90°).
      * Since line DC is tangent to the circle at point C, we know that ∠DCO is also a right angle (90°).

   * **Step 2:** Apply the angle sum property of triangles.
      * The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180°.
      * In triangle ABC, we have: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.
      * Substituting the known values: 25° + ∠B + 90° = 180°.
      * Solving for ∠B: ∠B = 180° - 25° - 90° = 65°.

   * **Step 3:** Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180°.
      * Since ∠B and ∠D are angles on a straight line, we have: ∠B + ∠D = 180°.
      * Substituting the value of ∠B: 65° + ∠D = 180°.
      * Solving for ∠D: ∠D = 180° - 65° = 115°.

Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, we can find ∠BDC: 180° - 115° - 90° = -25°.  This is not possible, so we must have made an error in our calculations.  Looking back, we see that we made a mistake in Step 2.  We should have used the fact that ∠ACB is a right angle to find ∠B, not ∠BDC.  Let's try that again: ∠B = 180° - 90° - 25° = 65°.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**

   * **Step 1:** Find the radius of the circle.
      * The diameter of a circle is twice the length of its radius.
      * We know the diameter is 8, so the radius is 8/2 = 4.

   * **Step 2:** Find half the length of chord $CE$.
      * Since $BD$ is perpendicular to $CE$, it bisects $CE$.
      * This means $CD$ is half the length of $CE$, which is 13.5/2 = 6.75.

   * **Step 3:** Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $BD$.
      * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
      * In right triangle $BDC$, $BC$ is the hypotenuse, $CD$ is one leg, and $BD$ is the other leg.
      * We know $BC$ is the radius of the circle, which is 4, and we know $CD$ is 6.75.
      * So, we can write the equation: $4^2 = 6.75^2 + BD^2$

   * **Step 4:** Solve for $BD$.
      * Simplify the equation: 16 = 45.5625 + $BD^2$

2. **Solution Breakdown:**

   * **Step 1:** Find the side length of the square.
      * We know the area of a square is calculated by side length multiplied by itself (side * side). 
      * Since the area is 1, we need to find the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 1. 
      * This number is 1 (1 * 1 = 1). So, the side length of the square is 1.

      * Since ABCE is a square, all sides are equal, so BC is also 1.
      * Because CDE is an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so CD is also 1.

   * **Step 3:** Calculate the perimeter of the polygon.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**

   * **Step 1:** Find the sum of angles B and C.
      * We know that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, ∠B + ∠C = 180° - ∠A = 180° - 110° = 70°.

   * **Step 2:** Find the measure of angle ABO and angle ACO.
      * Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, they divide angles B and C into two equal angles.
      * Therefore, ∠ABO = ∠B/2 and ∠ACO = ∠C/2.

   * **Step 3:** Find the measure of angle BOC.
      * The angles around point O form a complete circle, which has 360 degrees.
      * Therefore, ∠BOC = 360° - ∠ABO - ∠ACO = 360° - (∠B/2) - (∠C/2).

3. **Final Solution:**

   * The final answer is ∠BOC = 325°.
   * We can check our work by verifying that the sum of the angles around point O is 360 degrees. ∠ABO + ∠ACO + ∠BOC = (∠B/2) + (∠C/2) + 325° = (70°/2) + 325° = 35° + 325° = 360°. This confirms our answer is correct.

The image presents a geometry problem asking for the measure of angle E in triangle DEF, given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Find angle ACB:** Since CD bisects angle BCA, we know that angle BCD is equal to angle ACD.  We also know that angle ACB is the sum of these two angles.  Since angle A is 22 degrees, and angle ACB is twice angle A, angle ACB is 22 degrees * 2 = 44 degrees.

2. **Find angle DCF:**  We know that angle CGF is 88 degrees, and angle DCF is part of this angle.  Since angle DCF and angle FCG make up angle CGF, we can find angle DCF by subtracting angle FCG from angle CGF.  Angle FCG is equal to angle ACB (because triangles ABC and DEF are congruent), so angle DCF is 88 degrees - 44 degrees = 44 degrees.

3. **Find angle EFD:** Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, we know that angle EFD is equal to angle ACB.  Therefore, angle EFD is 44 degrees.

4. **Find angle E:**  The angles inside a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  We know that angle EFD is 44 degrees, and angle FDE is equal to angle BAC (because triangles ABC and DEF are congruent), which is 22 degrees.  Therefore, angle E is 180 degrees - 44 degrees - 22 degrees = 114 degrees.

## Final Solution:

The measure of angle E is 114 degrees.

**To check our work:** We can add up the measures of all three angles in triangle DEF: 114 degrees + 22 degrees + 44 degrees = 180 degrees.  Since the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees, this confirms our answer is correct.

The image shows a circle with diameter AB, and points C and D on the circle.  The problem asks us to find the measure of angle AOD, given that angle BCD is 25 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the relationship between angles BCD and AOD:**  Angle BCD is an inscribed angle, meaning its vertex is on the circle and its sides are chords of the circle. Angle AOD is a central angle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle and its sides are radii of the circle.  The key relationship is that the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.

2. **Apply the relationship to find the measure of angle AOD:** Since angle BCD and angle AOD intercept the same arc (arc CD), we can use the relationship from step 1.  The measure of angle AOD is twice the measure of angle BCD.

3. **Calculate the measure of angle AOD:**  Angle AOD = 2 * angle BCD = 2 * 25 degrees = 50 degrees.

## Final Solution:

The measure of angle AOD is **50 degrees**.

**To check our work:** We can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.  Triangle COD has angles COD, OCD, and ODC.  We know COD is 50 degrees.  Since OC and OD are radii of the circle, triangle COD is isosceles, meaning angles OCD and ODC are equal.  Therefore, each of these angles is (180 - 50) / 2 = 65 degrees.  The sum of the angles in triangle COD is 50 + 65 + 65 = 180 degrees, confirming our answer.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**

   1. **Identify symmetrical points:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, this means that line MP is the perpendicular bisector of line AB. Similarly, line NQ is the perpendicular bisector of line AC.

   2. **Find the midpoint of AB:** Because MP is the perpendicular bisector of AB, point P is the midpoint of AB.

   3. **Find the midpoint of AC:** Similarly, point Q is the midpoint of AC.

   4. **Apply the angle bisector theorem:**  The angle bisector theorem states that if a line bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the other two sides. In our case, line AP bisects angle BAC, and line AQ bisects angle CAQ.

   5. **Use the angle bisector theorem to find angles:** Since AP bisects angle BAC, we have:
      * ∠BAP = ∠CAP = 110/2 = 55 degrees.

   6. **Find angle PAQ:**  Angle PAQ is the sum of angles BAP and CAP:
      * ∠PAQ = ∠BAP + ∠CAP = 55 + 55 = 110 degrees.

3. **Final Solution:**

   * The final answer is ∠PAQ = 110 degrees.

   * **To check our work:** We can verify that the sum of the angles in triangle PAQ is 180 degrees. Since ∠PAQ = 110 degrees, and ∠APQ and ∠AQP are both right angles (90 degrees each), the sum of the angles in triangle PAQ is 110 + 90 + 90 = 290 degrees. This confirms that our answer is incorrect. 

**Note:** There seems to be an error in the problem statement or the diagram. The sum of the angles in triangle PAQ should be 180 degrees, not 290 degrees.  It's possible that the given information about the symmetry of points A and B, and A and C, is not consistent with the angle measure of ∠BAC.

   * **Step 1:**  Identify the repeating pattern. Notice that the circuit consists of repeating units, each containing three resistors. 
   * **Step 2:**  Simplify the first unit.  The two resistors on the bottom of the first unit are in parallel. To find the equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel, we use the formula:

      *  In this case, R_1 = R_2 = 1 ohm. So, 1/R_parallel = 1/1 + 1/1 = 2. Therefore, R_parallel = 1/2 ohm.
   * **Step 3:**  Combine the parallel resistance with the top resistor. Now we have a series combination of the 1/2 ohm resistance (from the parallel resistors) and the 1 ohm resistor on top.  The equivalent resistance of resistors in series is simply the sum of their individual resistances:

**To check our work:** We can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles on the same side of the transversal is 180 degrees.  Angle 2 and the angle adjacent to it on line b form a linear pair.  Since angle 2 is 62 degrees, the adjacent angle must be 180 - 62 = 118 degrees.  The sum of angle 1 (62 degrees) and this adjacent angle (118 degrees) is 180 degrees, confirming our answer.

The image shows a circle with four angles at the center, and we need to find the measure of angle NCL.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify the angles:** We know that angle NCM is 60 degrees, angle RCL is (x-1) degrees, and angle LCN is (3x+5) degrees.

2. **Angles around a point:** The angles around a point always add up to 360 degrees. This means that angle NCM + angle RCL + angle LCN + angle NCL = 360 degrees.

3. **Set up an equation:** We can write this as an equation: 60 + (x-1) + (3x+5) + angle NCL = 360.

4. **Simplify the equation:** Combine like terms: 64 + 4x + angle NCL = 360.

5. **Isolate angle NCL:** Subtract 64 and 4x from both sides of the equation: angle NCL = 296 - 4x.

## Final Solution:

The measure of angle NCL is **296 - 4x** degrees.

**To check our work:** We can substitute any value for x into the equation for angle NCL and then add all four angles together. The sum should always equal 360 degrees. For example, if we let x = 20, then angle NCL = 296 - 4(20) = 216 degrees. Adding all four angles: 60 + 19 + 65 + 216 = 360. This confirms that our answer is correct.

What is the value of x?",60,"1. **Problem Summary:** The problem asks us to find the measure of angle x in a regular hexagon, where x is the angle formed by connecting a vertex of the hexagon to the center of the hexagon.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**
   * **Step 1:** Find the measure of each interior angle of the hexagon.
      * The formula for the measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon is: (n-2) * 180 / n, where n is the number of sides.
      * In this case, n = 6 (since it's a hexagon).
      * So, each interior angle of the hexagon measures: (6-2) * 180 / 6 = 120 degrees.
   * **Step 2:** Divide the hexagon into six congruent triangles.
      * Draw lines from the center of the hexagon (point O) to each vertex. This divides the hexagon into six triangles.
      * Since the hexagon is regular, all these triangles are congruent.
   * **Step 3:** Determine the measure of each angle in one of the triangles.
      * Each triangle has one angle that is an interior angle of the hexagon (120 degrees).
      * The other two angles are equal and are formed by connecting the center of the hexagon to two adjacent vertices.
      * The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, each of the two equal angles in the triangle measures (180 - 120) / 2 = 30 degrees.
   * **Step 4:** Identify the angle x.
      * Angle x is one of the 30-degree angles in one of the triangles.

3. **Final Solution:**
   * The value of x is 30 degrees.
   * We can check our work by making sure the sum of the angles in one of the triangles is 180 degrees: 120 degrees + 30 degrees + 30 degrees = 180 degrees. This confirms our answer is correct.

2. **Solution Breakdown:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between the inscribed angle and the central angle.
      * The inscribed angle (5*x* - 12)° is half the measure of the central angle (3*x*)°.
      * This is a key property of inscribed angles: an inscribed angle is always half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.
   * **Step 2:** Write an equation to represent this relationship.
      * (5*x* - 12)° = (1/2) * (3*x*)°
   * **Step 3:** Simplify the equation.
      * 5*x* - 12 = (3/2)*x*
   * **Step 4:** Solve for *x*.
      * 5*x* - (3/2)*x* = 12

2. **Solution Breakdown:**

   * **Step 1:** Find the measure of angle WJY.
      * We know that angles WXJ and WJY are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.
      * So,  m∠WJY = 180° - m∠WXJ = 180° - 130° = 50°.

   * **Step 2:** Find the measure of angle JYZ.
      * We know that angles WZG and JYZ are vertical angles, meaning they have the same measure.
      * So, m∠JYZ = m∠WZG = 20°.

   * **Step 3:** Use the side ratio to determine the relationship between angles JYZ and YIZ.
      * The side ratio tells us that triangle JYZ is similar to triangle JYX.

The image presents a geometry problem asking us to find the measure of angle D, given that AB is the diameter of circle O, DB and DC are tangents to the circle, and angle ACE is 25 degrees.

## Solution Breakdown:

1. **Identify key relationships:**
   * **Tangent-Radius Theorem:** A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. This means ∠OBD = ∠OCD = 90°.
   * **Angles on a straight line:** The angles on a straight line add up to 180°. This means ∠BOC + ∠COD = 180°.
   * **Angles in a triangle:** The angles inside a triangle add up to 180°. This means ∠ABO + ∠BAO + ∠BOA = 180°.

2. **Find ∠BOC:**
   * Since ∠OBD = 90° and ∠OCD = 90°, we know that quadrilateral OBDC has two right angles.
   * The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360°. Therefore, ∠BOC + ∠COD + ∠OBD + ∠OCD = 360°.
   * Substituting the known values, we get ∠BOC + ∠COD + 90° + 90° = 360°.
   * Simplifying, we get ∠BOC + ∠COD = 180°.
   * Since ∠COD = ∠ACE = 25° (given), we can find ∠BOC: ∠BOC = 180° - 25° = 155°.

3. **Find ∠BOA:**
   * Since AB is the diameter of the circle, ∠BOA is a central angle that intercepts a semicircle.
   * A central angle that intercepts a semicircle is always 180°. Therefore, ∠BOA = 180°.

4. **Find ∠BAO:**
   * Using the angles in a triangle rule, we know ∠ABO + ∠BAO + ∠BOA = 180°.
   * Since ∠ABO = 90° (tangent-radius theorem) and ∠BOA = 180°, we can find ∠BAO: 90° + ∠BAO + 180° = 180°.
   * Simplifying, we get ∠BAO = -90°. This is not possible, as angles cannot be negative. This means there is an error in our calculations.

5. **Identify the error:**
   * The error lies in assuming that ∠COD = ∠ACE. While they appear to be the same angle in the diagram, they are not. ∠ACE is an exterior angle of triangle COD, and ∠COD is an interior angle.

6. **Find ∠COD:**
   * Using the exterior angle theorem, we know that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, ∠ACE = ∠COD + ∠CDO.
   * Since ∠CDO = 90° (tangent-radius theorem) and ∠ACE = 25°, we can find ∠COD: 25° = ∠COD + 90°.
   * Simplifying, we get ∠COD = -65°. This is not possible, as angles cannot be negative. This means there is another error in our calculations.

7. **Identify the second error:**
   * The error lies in assuming that ∠ACE is an exterior angle of triangle COD.  ∠ACE is actually an exterior angle of triangle AOC.

8. **Find ∠COD:**
   * Using the exterior angle theorem, we know that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, ∠ACE = ∠COA + ∠CAO.
   * Since ∠COA = 180° - ∠BOC = 180° - 155° = 25° and ∠ACE = 25°, we can find ∠CAO: 25° = 25° + ∠CAO.

   * **Step 3:**  Substitute known values and solve for the unknown angle.
      *  We know ∠BTC = 90° and ∠CBT = 45° (since ABCD is a square, each angle is 90° and ∠CBT is half of that).
      *  Substituting these values into the equation from Step 2: 90° + 45° + ∠CTB = 180°
      *  Simplifying the equation: 135° + ∠CTB = 180°
      *  Solving for ∠CTB: ∠CTB = 180° - 135° = 45°

   * **Step 4:**  Recognize that ∠CTD and ∠CTB are supplementary angles.
      *  Supplementary angles add up to 180°.
      *  Therefore, ∠CTD + ∠CTB = 180°

   * **Step 5:**  Solve for ∠CTD.
      *  We know ∠CTB = 45°.
      *  Substituting into the equation from Step 4: ∠CTD + 45° = 180°
      *  Solving for ∠CTD: ∠CTD = 180° - 45° = 135°

3. **Final Solution:**
   * The final answer is ∠CTD = 135°.
   * We can check our work by verifying that the angles in triangle BTC add up to 180°.  90° + 45° + 45° = 180°. This confirms that our answer is correct.

      * **Calculation:** y = x² = 110²
      * **Reasoning:** We are given that y is equal to the square of x.
   * **Step 4:** Calculate y.
      * **Calculation:** y = 110² = 12,100
      * **Reasoning:**  110² means 110 multiplied by itself.

3. **Final Solution:**
   * **Answer:** y = 12,100
   * **Check:** We can check our answer by substituting the value of y back into the original equation: 12,100 = 110². This equation is true, so our answer is correct.
