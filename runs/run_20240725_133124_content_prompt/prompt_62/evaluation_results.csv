643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with center O, diameter CD, and chords DE and OA. We are given that DE is parallel to OA and that angle D measures 50 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle C.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
      * Since DE is parallel to OA, we know that angle D and angle A are corresponding angles and therefore congruent. This means angle A also measures 50 degrees.
      * Angle COD is a central angle that intercepts the same arc as inscribed angle A. The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc. 
   * **Step 2: Calculate the measure of angle COD.**
      * Using the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles, we have:
         *  ∠COD = 2 * ∠A = 2 * 50° = 100°
   * **Step 3: Determine the measure of angle C.**
      * Triangle COD is an isosceles triangle because CO and OD are both radii of the circle. Therefore, angles C and D in triangle COD are congruent.
      * The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can find angle C:
         * ∠C + ∠D + ∠COD = 180°
         * ∠C + 50° + 100° = 180°
         * ∠C = 180° - 50° - 100° = 30°

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"1. **Problem:** The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is labeled ""h"", and the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle is labeled ""4"". The problem asks us to find the length of the hypotenuse, ""h"".

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio to use.**
      * We know the length of the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle (4) and we want to find the length of the hypotenuse (h). 
      * The trigonometric ratio that relates the adjacent side and the hypotenuse is the cosine: 
         * cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse
   * **Step 2: Set up the equation.**
      * We know the angle is 60 degrees, the adjacent side is 4, and the hypotenuse is h.  Let's plug these values into the cosine formula:
         * cos(60°) = 4 / h
   * **Step 3: Solve for h.**
      * To isolate h, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by h:
         * h * cos(60°) = 4
      * Then, divide both sides by cos(60°):
         * h = 4 / cos(60°)
   * **Step 4: Calculate the value of h.**
      * We know that cos(60°) = 1/2.  Substitute this value into the equation:
         * h = 4 / (1/2)
      * Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal:
         * h = 4 * 2
         * h = 8

3. **Answer:** The length of the hypotenuse, h, is 8.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relationship between the radii of the two circles. Since the centers of both circles lie on the same line, the radius of the larger circle is equal to the sum of the radius of the smaller circle and the distance between the centers of the two circles.
   * **Step 2:**  Let 'r' be the radius of the smaller circle.  We know the radius of the larger circle is 4.  Therefore, the distance between the centers of the two circles is 4 - r.
   * **Step 3:**  Since the centers of the circles lie on the same line, the distance between the centers is also equal to the radius of the larger circle minus the radius of the smaller circle.  This can be written as: 4 - r = 4 - r.
   * **Step 4:**  Solve for 'r'.  Since the equation is true for any value of 'r', we can conclude that the radius of the smaller circle is half the radius of the larger circle.
   * **Step 5:**  Calculate the radius of the smaller circle: r = 4 / 2 = 2.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify the relevant angles.**
      * We are given that ∠AOD = 70°.
      * We need to find ∠AOE.
      * Since OE bisects ∠BOC, we know that ∠BOE = ∠COE.

   * **Step 2: Use the concept of supplementary angles.**
      * Angles AOD and BOC are supplementary angles because they form a straight line. This means their sum is 180°.
      * Therefore, ∠BOC = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.

   * **Step 3: Use the concept of angle bisector.**
      * Since OE bisects ∠BOC, we know that ∠BOE = ∠COE = ∠BOC / 2 = 110° / 2 = 55°.

   * **Step 4: Use the concept of adjacent angles.**
      * Angles AOE and BOE are adjacent angles because they share a common side (OE) and a common vertex (O).
      * Therefore, ∠AOE + ∠BOE = ∠AOB = 180°.
      * So, ∠AOE = ∠AOB - ∠BOE = 180° - 55° = 125°.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Understand the Incenter**
      * The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.
      * The incenter is also the center of the inscribed circle of the triangle.
      * The incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle.

   * **Step 2: Draw the Inscribed Circle**
      * Draw a circle inside triangle JLN that touches all three sides of the triangle. This is the inscribed circle.
      * The incenter Q is the center of this circle.

   * **Step 3: Draw Perpendiculars from the Incenter**
      * Draw perpendicular lines from the incenter Q to each side of the triangle. These lines will be radii of the inscribed circle.
      * Label the points where these perpendiculars intersect the sides of the triangle as P, M, and K.

   * **Step 4: Use the Properties of the Incenter**
      * Since Q is the incenter, we know that QK = QM = QP.
      * We are given that QM = 9. Therefore, QK = QP = 9.

   * **Step 5: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**
      * We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find JQ.
      * The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
      * In right triangle JQK, JQ is the hypotenuse, JK is one leg, and QK is the other leg.
      * We know QK = 9 and JK = 16.5.
      * Therefore, we can write: JQ² = JK² + QK²
      * Substitute the values: JQ² = 16.5² + 9²
      * Calculate: JQ² = 272.25 + 81 = 353.25
      * Take the square root of both sides: JQ = √353.25

We are given that AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13. The problem asks us to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the properties of a perpendicular bisector.**
      * A perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line that cuts the segment into two equal parts and is perpendicular to the segment.
      * In this case, since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that AD = DB = AB/2 = 6/2 = 3.

   * **Step 2: Use the perimeter information to find AC.**
      * The perimeter of triangle ACE is the sum of its sides: AC + CE + AE = 13.
      * We know that AE = AD + DE, and since AD = 3, we can rewrite the perimeter equation as: AC + CE + (3 + DE) = 13.
      * Simplifying, we get: AC + CE + DE = 10.

   * **Step 3: Use the properties of the perpendicular bisector to find BC.**
      * Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we know that BE = CE.
      * Therefore, we can rewrite the equation from Step 2 as: AC + 2CE = 10.

   * **Step 4: Find the perimeter of triangle ABC.**
      * The perimeter of triangle ABC is the sum of its sides: AB + BC + AC.
      * We know that AB = 6 and BC = BE + CE = 2CE.
      * Substituting these values into the perimeter equation, we get: 6 + 2CE + AC.
      * From Step 3, we know that AC + 2CE = 10.
      * Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABC is 6 + 10 = 16.

Given that AB = 3 and AD = 4, the problem asks us to find the length of EF.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the properties of angle bisectors.**
      * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.
      * In this case, BE bisects angle ABC, so angle ABE = angle CBE. Similarly, CF bisects angle BCD, so angle BCF = angle DCF.

   * **Step 2: Identify similar triangles.**
      * Triangle ABE and triangle CBE share angle ABE and angle CBE, and they both have angle AEB in common. Therefore, triangle ABE is similar to triangle CBE (Angle-Angle Similarity).
      * Similarly, triangle DCF is similar to triangle BCF.

   * **Step 3: Use the properties of similar triangles to find the ratios of corresponding sides.**
      * Since triangle ABE is similar to triangle CBE, we have the following ratio: AB/BC = AE/EC.
      * Since triangle DCF is similar to triangle BCF, we have the following ratio: DC/BC = DF/FB.

   * **Step 4: Use the given information to solve for AE and DF.**
      * We know AB = 3 and AD = 4. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = DC = 3.
      * From the ratios in Step 3, we can write:
         * AE/EC = AB/BC = 3/BC
         * DF/FB = DC/BC = 3/BC
      * Since AE + EC = AD = 4, we can substitute AE = 3EC/BC into this equation and solve for EC:
         * 3EC/BC + EC = 4
         * EC(3/BC + 1) = 4
         * EC = 4BC/(3 + BC)
      * Similarly, we can substitute DF = 3FB/BC into DF + FB = AD = 4 and solve for FB:
         * 3FB/BC + FB = 4
         * FB(3/BC + 1) = 4
         * FB = 4BC/(3 + BC)

   * **Step 5: Calculate EF.**
      * EF = AE + DF = 3EC/BC + 3FB/BC = 3(EC + FB)/BC
      * Substitute the values of EC and FB we found in Step 4:
         * EF = 3(4BC/(3 + BC) + 4BC/(3 + BC))/BC
         * EF = 3(8BC/(3 + BC))/BC
         * EF = 24/(3 + BC)

   * **Step 6: Find BC.**
      * Since ABCD is a parallelogram, BC = AD = 4.

We are given that line OD bisects ∠AOE and ∠BOC = 50°. We need to find the measure of ∠EOB.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand angle bisectors.**
      * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles. Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.
   * **Step 2: Identify related angles.**
      * ∠AOE and ∠EOB are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180°. This is because they form a straight line.
      * ∠BOC and ∠EOD are vertically opposite angles, meaning they are equal.
   * **Step 3: Use the given information to find ∠EOD.**
      * We know ∠BOC = 50°, and since ∠BOC and ∠EOD are vertically opposite, we have ∠EOD = 50°.
   * **Step 4: Use the angle bisector property to find ∠AOE.**
      * Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we have ∠AOD = ∠DOE.
      * We know ∠EOD = 50°, so ∠AOD = 50° as well.
      * Therefore, ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠DOE = 50° + 50° = 100°.
   * **Step 5: Calculate ∠EOB.**
      * We know ∠AOE and ∠EOB are supplementary angles, so ∠EOB = 180° - ∠AOE = 180° - 100° = 80°.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles.**
      * We are given that AB is parallel to CD and BC is parallel to DE. This means we have two pairs of parallel lines.
      * When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.
      * We can use this to find the measure of angle BDE.

   * **Step 2: Find angle BDE.**
      * Since BC is parallel to DE, angle C and angle BDE are corresponding angles.

   * **Step 3: Find angle ABE.**
      * Since AB is parallel to CD, angle A and angle ABE are corresponding angles.
      * Therefore, angle ABE = angle A = 45 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Use the angle sum property of a triangle.**
      * The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.
      * In triangle ABE, we know angle ABE = 45 degrees and angle BAE = 45 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle AEB = 180 - 45 - 45 = 90 degrees.

   * **Step 5: Find angle AED.**

   * **Step 1: Identify the relevant geometric shapes.**
      * We have a right triangle ABC and a smaller triangle ADE within it.
      * Since D and E are midpoints, we know that AD = DC and AE = EB.

   * **Step 2: Apply the Midsegment Theorem.**
      * The Midsegment Theorem states that the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
      * In our case, DE is the segment connecting the midpoints of AC and AB. Therefore, DE is parallel to BC and half the length of BC.

      * Since BM is perpendicular to AM, we know that angle BMA = 90 degrees.

   * **Step 3: Use the properties to find additional information.**
      * Since angle BMA = 90 degrees, triangle BMA is a right triangle.
      * We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BM: BM² + AM² = AB²
      * We know AB = 8 and MN = 2, so we can find AM: AM = AB - MN = 8 - 2 = 6.
      * Now we can find BM: BM² = AB² - AM² = 8² - 6² = 28, so BM = √28 = 2√7.

   * **Step 4: Use the properties to find the length of AC.**
      * Since angle BAM = angle CAM and BM is perpendicular to AM, we know that triangles BMA and CMA are congruent.
      * Therefore, BM = CM = 2√7.
      * Since N is the midpoint of BC, we know that BN = NC = BC/2.
      * We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AC: AC² = CM² + NC² = (2√7)² + (BC/2)²
      * We need to find BC. Since BN = NC, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle BMN: BN² = BM² + MN² = (2√7)² + 2² = 32, so BN = √32 = 4√2.

A chord AB with length 8.0 is drawn within the circle. The problem asks us to find the distance from the center O to the chord AB.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Visualize the problem.**
      * Imagine drawing a perpendicular line from the center O to the chord AB. This line will bisect the chord AB, creating two equal segments.
      * Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects the chord AB as point M. 
      * Now we have a right triangle OMA, where OA is the radius of the circle, AM is half the length of the chord AB, and OM is the distance we need to find.

   * **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem.**
      * The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
      * In our triangle OMA, OA is the hypotenuse, AM is one leg, and OM is the other leg.
      * So, we can write the equation: OA² = AM² + OM²

   * **Step 3: Substitute the known values.**
      * OA = 5.0 (radius of the circle)
      * AM = AB/2 = 8.0/2 = 4.0 (half the length of the chord)
      * We need to find OM.

   * **Step 4: Solve for OM.**
      * Substitute the values into the equation: 5.0² = 4.0² + OM²
      * Simplify: 25.0 = 16.0 + OM²
      * Subtract 16.0 from both sides: 9.0 = OM²
      * Take the square root of both sides: OM = √9.0 = 3.0

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Identify the relevant geometric concept.**
      * The problem involves a right triangle and its midpoint. This suggests we can use the concept of the **midsegment theorem**.
      * The midsegment theorem states that the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

   * **Step 2: Apply the midsegment theorem.**
      * Since D is the midpoint of AB, line segment CD is a midsegment of triangle ABC.
      * Therefore, CD is parallel to BC and half the length of BC.

   * **Step 3: Find the length of BC.**
      * We know AB = 10 and ∠ACB = 90°.
      * Since D is the midpoint of AB, AD = DB = 10/2 = 5.
      * Triangle ADC is a right triangle with AD = 5 and AC = unknown.
      * We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AC: AC² + AD² = CD²
      * Substituting the values: AC² + 5² = 10²
      * Solving for AC: AC² = 100 - 25 = 75
      * Therefore, AC = √75 = 5√3.
      * Since BC is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again: BC² = AC² + AB²
      * Substituting the values: BC² = (5√3)² + 10² = 75 + 100 = 175
      * Therefore, BC = √175 = 5√7.

   * **Step 4: Calculate the length of CD.**

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
      * We have two right triangles: ABC and AB'C'.
      * The rotation of 90 degrees means that angle B'AC' is also 90 degrees.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand angle bisectors**
      *  An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.
      *  Since BE bisects angle FBD, we know that angle FBE = angle EBD.
      *  Similarly, since CE bisects angle ACD, we know that angle ACE = angle ECD.

   * **Step 2: Find angle FBE and angle EBD**
      *  We know that angle BEC = 35 degrees.
      *  Angle BEC is an exterior angle of triangle BCE.
      *  The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
      *  Therefore, angle BEC = angle BCE + angle CBE.
      *  Since CE bisects angle ACD, angle BCE = angle ECD.
      *  Let's call angle BCE (and angle ECD) 'x'.
      *  Similarly, let's call angle CBE (and angle FBE) 'y'.
      *  So, we have 35 = x + y.

   * **Step 3: Find angle FBD**
      *  Angle FBD is the sum of angles FBE and EBD.
      *  Since BE bisects angle FBD, angle FBE = angle EBD = y.
      *  Therefore, angle FBD = y + y = 2y.

   * **Step 4: Find angle ACD**
      *  Angle ACD is the sum of angles ACE and ECD.
      *  Since CE bisects angle ACD, angle ACE = angle ECD = x.
      *  Therefore, angle ACD = x + x = 2x.

   * **Step 5: Find angle BAC**
      *  Angle BAC is an exterior angle of triangle ACE.
      *  Therefore, angle BAC = angle ACE + angle AEC.
      *  We know angle ACE = x and angle AEC = 180 - angle BEC = 180 - 35 = 145 degrees.
      *  So, angle BAC = x + 145.

   * **Step 6: Find angle FAE**
      *  Angle FAE is the sum of angles FAB and BAC.
      *  Angle FAB is an exterior angle of triangle FBA.
      *  Therefore, angle FAB = angle FBA + angle FBA = 2y.
      *  So, angle FAE = 2y + (x + 145) = 2y + x + 145.

   * **Step 7: Use the information from Step 2 to simplify**
      *  We know that 35 = x + y.
      *  Solving for y, we get y = 35 - x.
      *  Substituting this value of y into the expression for angle FAE, we get:
      *  angle FAE = 2(35 - x) + x + 145 = 70 - 2x + x + 145 = 215 - x.

   * **Step 8: Use the information from Step 4 to find x**
      *  We know that angle ACD = 2x.
      *  Angle ACD is also an exterior angle of triangle ABC.
      *  Therefore, angle ACD = angle BAC + angle ABC.
      *  We know angle BAC = x + 145 and angle ABC = 180 - angle FBD = 180 - 2y.
      *  Substituting the value of y from Step 7, we get angle ABC = 180 - 2(35 - x) = 110 + 2x.
      *  So, 2x = (x + 145) + (110 + 2x).
      *  Simplifying, we get x = 255.

      * **Formula:**  m∠A + m∠B + m∠C + m∠D = 360°
      * **Calculation:**  Substituting the known angle measures, we get:

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
      * We know that ∠AOF = 40°.
      * Since AB is a diameter, ∠AEB is a right angle (90°).
      * Since E is the midpoint of FEB, ∠FEB = ∠FEF.
      * We need to find ∠F, which is the same as ∠FEF.

   * **Step 2: Use the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180°.**
      * In triangle AOF, we have: ∠AOF + ∠FAO + ∠FOA = 180°.
      * Since ∠AOF = 40° and ∠FAO = ∠FOA (because OA = OF, the radii of the circle), we can solve for ∠FAO:
         * 40° + ∠FAO + ∠FAO = 180°
         * 2∠FAO = 140°
         * ∠FAO = 70°

   * **Step 3: Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180°.**
      * Since ∠FAO and ∠FAE are on a straight line, we have: ∠FAO + ∠FAE = 180°.
      * We know ∠FAO = 70°, so:
         * 70° + ∠FAE = 180°
         * ∠FAE = 110°

   * **Step 4: Use the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180° again.**
      * In triangle FAE, we have: ∠FAE + ∠FEA + ∠EAF = 180°.
      * We know ∠FAE = 110° and ∠EAF = 90° (because ∠AEB is a right angle), so:
         * 110° + ∠FEA + 90° = 180°
         * ∠FEA = 180° - 200°
         * ∠FEA = -20°

   * **Step 5:  Recognize that angles cannot be negative.**
      * Since ∠FEA is an angle in a triangle, it cannot be negative. This means we made an error in our calculations.  Let's go back and check our work.

   * **Step 6: Correct the error in Step 4.**
      * We incorrectly added 110° and 90° in Step 4.  The correct calculation is:
         * 110° + ∠FEA + 90° = 180°
         * ∠FEA = 180° - 200°
         * ∠FEA = -20°

   * **Step 7:  Use the fact that ∠FEB = ∠FEF.**
      * Since E is the midpoint of FEB, we know ∠FEB = ∠FEF.  We also know that ∠FEA + ∠FEB = 180° (angles on a straight line).  Therefore:
         * ∠FEF + ∠FEF = 180°
         * 2∠FEF = 180°

We are given that ∠DCF = 20.0 degrees and asked to find the measure of ∠EOD.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify relevant geometric relationships.**
      *  Since CD is a diameter, ∠CED is a right angle (90 degrees) because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle.
      *  Since G is the midpoint of chord EF, line segment OG is perpendicular to EF (OG ⊥ EF). This is because a line segment from the center of a circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.
      *  Therefore, ∠EGO and ∠FGO are both right angles (90 degrees).

   * **Step 2: Apply angle relationships in triangles.**
      *  In triangle CGF, we know ∠CGF = 90 degrees and ∠DCF = 20 degrees.  The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so ∠CFG = 180 - 90 - 20 = 70 degrees.
      *  Since ∠EGO and ∠FGO are both right angles, ∠EGF = 180 - 90 - 90 = 0 degrees. This means that points E, G, and F are collinear.

   * **Step 3: Use the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.**
      *  ∠EOD is a central angle, and ∠EFD is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc ED.  The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
      *  Therefore, ∠EOD = 2 * ∠EFD.

   * **Step 4: Find ∠EFD.**

      * We know that DE = 3 and AC = 4.
      * We also know that DE is perpendicular to AB, making triangle ADE a right triangle.
      * AD bisects angle BAC, meaning angle BAD is equal to angle CAD.

   * **Step 2: Find the length of AD.**
      * Since triangle ADE is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AD.
      * The Pythagorean theorem states: a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
      * In triangle ADE, DE is one leg (a = 3), AE is the other leg (b), and AD is the hypotenuse (c).
      * We need to find AE first. Since AD bisects angle BAC, we know that angle BAD = angle CAD. Therefore, triangles ADE and ADC are similar triangles. This means their corresponding sides are proportional.
      * We can set up a proportion: AE/DE = AC/DC.
      * We know DE = 3 and AC = 4. We need to find DC.
      * Since AD bisects angle BAC, we know that BD/DC = AB/AC.
      * We don't know AB, but we can use the fact that triangles ADE and ADC are similar to find it.
      * The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal. Therefore, AB/AC = AE/AD.
      * We can substitute this into the previous equation: BD/DC = AE/AD.
      * We know DE = 3 and AC = 4. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AD: AD² = DE² + AE².
      * We can substitute this into the equation: BD/DC = AE/√(DE² + AE²).
      * We can solve for AE: AE = (BD/DC) * √(DE² + AE²).
      * We don't know BD or DC, but we can use the fact that BC = BD + DC.

      * We don't know BD or BC, but we can use the fact that triangles ADE and ADC are similar to find them.
      * The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal. Therefore, BD/BC = DE/AC.
      * We know DE = 3 and AC = 4. Therefore, BD/BC = 3/4.
      * We can substitute this into the equation: AE = (3/4 * √(DE² + AE²)) / (1 - 3/4).
      * We can solve for AE: AE = 3 * √(DE² + AE²).
      * We know DE = 3. Therefore, AE = 3 * √(3² + AE²).

We are given that ∠D = 35.0°, ∠AEC = 105.0°, and we need to find the measure of ∠C.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify the relevant angles and relationships.**
      * We are given ∠D and ∠AEC. We need to find ∠C.
      * Notice that ∠AEC and ∠CED are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°).
      * Also, ∠CED and ∠C are angles in the same segment of the circle.

   * **Step 2: Calculate ∠CED.**
      * Since ∠AEC and ∠CED are supplementary angles, we have:
         ∠CED = 180° - ∠AEC = 180° - 105° = 75°

816,"Find x. Round to the nearest tenth, if necessary.",3,"1. **Problem:** The image shows a circle with a diameter of 24 and a triangle inscribed in the circle. One side of the triangle is a diameter of the circle, and the other two sides are chords of the circle. The lengths of the two chords are 9 and 12.25, and one of the chords is labeled with the variable 'x'. The problem asks us to find the value of 'x'.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**
      * The problem involves a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side of the triangle is a diameter of the circle. This scenario relates to the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**, which states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   * **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**
      * Since the side of the triangle with length 'x' is a chord of the circle, it intercepts an arc of the circle. The angle opposite this chord is a right angle (90 degrees) because it's inscribed in a semicircle.
      * According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of the intercepted arc is twice the measure of the inscribed angle. Therefore, the intercepted arc has a measure of 2 * 90 degrees = 180 degrees.
   * **Step 3: Use the relationship between arc length and diameter.**
      * The intercepted arc is a semicircle, which is half the circumference of the circle. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter.
      * In this case, the diameter is 24, so the circumference is C = π * 24 = 24π.
      * The arc length is half the circumference, so it's 24π / 2 = 12π.
   * **Step 4: Relate the arc length to the chord length.**
      * The chord with length 'x' intercepts the arc with length 12π. Since the chord is a straight line segment within the circle, its length is less than the arc length.
      * To find the length of the chord, we need to consider the relationship between the chord and the arc. This relationship is not directly provided by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, but we can use the fact that the chord is a straight line segment within the circle.
      * Since the chord is a straight line segment, its length is the shortest distance between its endpoints. The arc length, on the other hand, is the curved distance between the same endpoints. Therefore, the chord length is always less than or equal to the arc length.
   * **Step 5: Estimate the value of 'x'.**
      * We know that the chord length 'x' is less than the arc length 12π. We can estimate the value of 12π as approximately 37.7.
      * Since 'x' is less than 37.7, we can conclude that 'x' is likely less than 37.7.
   * **Step 6: Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find 'x'.**
      * The triangle with sides of length 9, 12.25, and 'x' is a right triangle because one of its angles is a right angle.
      * The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
      * In this case, the hypotenuse is the side with length 12.25, and the other two sides have lengths 9 and 'x'. Therefore, we can write the equation: 12.25² = 9² + x²
      * Solving for 'x', we get:
         * 12.25² - 9² = x²
         * 150.0625 - 81 = x²
         * 69.0625 = x²
         * x = √69.0625 ≈ 8.3
   * **Step 7: Round to the nearest tenth.**
      * The problem asks us to round the answer to the nearest tenth. Therefore, the final answer is x ≈ 8.3.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify the relationship between the angles.**
      *  Angle ACB is an inscribed angle of the circle, meaning its vertex is on the circle and its sides are chords of the circle.
      * Angle BAO is a central angle of the circle, meaning its vertex is at the center of the circle and its sides are radii of the circle.

The problem asks us to find the measure of angle D.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
      * We know that angle A is 25 degrees.
      * We also know that line DC is tangent to the circle at point C. This means that angle OCB is a right angle (90 degrees).
      * Since AB is the diameter, angle ACB is also a right angle (90 degrees).

   * **Step 2: Apply the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem.**
      * The Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
      * In our case, angle D is formed by the tangent DC and the chord AC. The intercepted arc is AC.

   * **Step 3: Find the measure of arc AC.**
      * Since angle ACB is a right angle, arc AC is half the circumference of the circle.
      * The measure of a full circle is 360 degrees, so arc AC is 360 degrees / 2 = 180 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Calculate angle D.**
      * Using the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem, angle D is half the measure of arc AC.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric relationships.
      * We know that CE is a chord of the circle, and BD is a diameter.
      * The diameter of a circle bisects any chord that is perpendicular to it.
      * Therefore, BD bisects CE at point D.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the Pythagorean theorem.
      * We have a right triangle CDB, where CD is half of CE, and BD is the hypotenuse.
      * The Pythagorean theorem states:  a² + b² = c², where a and b are the legs of a right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse.
      * In our case, a = CD = CE/2 = 13.5/2 = 6.75, and c = BD.
      * We need to find b, which is DB.
   * **Step 3:** Solve for BD.
      * Substitute the known values into the Pythagorean theorem: 6.75² + b² = BD²
      * Calculate 6.75² = 45.5625
      * Rearrange the equation to solve for BD: BD² = 45.5625 + b²
      * Take the square root of both sides: BD = √(45.5625 + b²)
      * Since we don't know the value of b, we can't find the exact value of BD. However, we can find the length of BD using the fact that AB is the radius of the circle, and BD is the diameter.

Line segment AO is parallel to line segment BC, and angle AOB is 40 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle OAC.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
      * We know that AO is parallel to BC, and we're looking for the measure of angle OAC.  These angles are related because they are alternate interior angles formed by a transversal (line segment AC) intersecting two parallel lines.
      * **Reasoning:** Alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines are congruent (have the same measure).

   * **Step 2: Apply the relationship between alternate interior angles.**
      * Since AO is parallel to BC, angle OAC is congruent to angle OCB.
      * **Reasoning:** This is the key to solving the problem. We can use the fact that these angles are equal to find the measure of angle OAC.

   * **Step 3: Use the properties of angles in a circle.**
      * Angle AOB is a central angle of the circle, and angle OCB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as angle AOB.
      * **Formula:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.
      * **Reasoning:** This is a fundamental property of circles that allows us to relate central angles and inscribed angles.

   * **Step 4: Calculate the measure of angle OCB.**
      * We know that angle AOB = 40 degrees.
      * Using the formula from Step 3, angle OCB = (1/2) * angle AOB = (1/2) * 40 degrees = 20 degrees.
      * **Calculation:** (1/2) * 40 = 20

   * **Step 5: Determine the measure of angle OAC.**

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify key properties of a rhombus.**
      * A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal.
      * The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
      * The diagonals of a rhombus divide it into four congruent right-angled triangles.

   * **Step 2: Draw a diagram and label the points.**
      * The image already provides a diagram. We can label the intersection point of the diagonals as O.

   * **Step 3: Apply the midpoint theorem.**
      * The midpoint theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
      * In triangle ABD, E and F are the midpoints of AB and AD respectively. Therefore, EF is parallel to BD and EF = 1/2 BD.

   * **Step 4: Find the length of BD.**
      * Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BD.
      * In right-angled triangle AOB, AO = AC/2 = 6/2 = 3 and AB = 5.
      * Applying the Pythagorean theorem: BO² = AB² - AO² = 5² - 3² = 16.
      * Therefore, BO = √16 = 4.
      * Since the diagonals bisect each other, BD = 2 * BO = 2 * 4 = 8.

   * **Step 5: Calculate the length of EF.**

      * The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. 
      * This theorem helps us determine if a set of side lengths can form a triangle.

   * **Step 2: Apply the Theorem to the given sides**
      * We have sides of length 7 and 12. Let's consider the possible scenarios for the third side:
         * **Scenario 1:** If the third side is less than 5 (12 - 7 = 5), then the sum of the two smaller sides (7 + the third side) would be less than 12, violating the Triangle Inequality Theorem.
         * **Scenario 2:** If the third side is greater than 19 (12 + 7 = 19), then the sum of the two larger sides (12 + the third side) would be greater than the sum of the other two sides (7 + the third side), again violating the Triangle Inequality Theorem.

   * **Step 3: Determine the possible perimeter range**
      * Based on the Triangle Inequality Theorem, the third side must be greater than 5 and less than 19.
      * Therefore, the perimeter (sum of all sides) must be greater than 22 (7 + 12 + 5) and less than 38 (7 + 12 + 19).

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Understand the properties of angle bisectors.
      * An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.

      * In triangle ACO: ∠ACO + ∠CAO + ∠COA = 180°
      * In triangle BOC: ∠BOC + ∠OBC + ∠OCB = 180°

      * In triangle ABO: x + 110° + ∠BOA = 180°
      * In triangle ACO: y + 110° + ∠COA = 180°
      * In triangle BOC: ∠BOC + x + y = 180°
      * From the first two equations, we get: ∠BOA = 70° - x and ∠COA = 70° - y
      * Substituting these values into the third equation: ∠BOC + x + y = 180°
      * Simplifying: ∠BOC = 180° - x - y
      * Since x + y = 1/2 (∠B + ∠C) = 1/2 (180° - ∠A) = 1/2 (180° - 110°) = 35°

We need to find a point M on BC and a point N on CD such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized.  The problem then asks us to find the sum of angles ∠AMN and ∠ANM.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understanding the problem**
      * We need to find the smallest possible perimeter of triangle AMN. This means we need to find the shortest possible distances AM, MN, and AN.
      * The problem doesn't give us any side lengths, so we need to use geometric principles to find the solution.

   * **Step 2: Finding the shortest distances**
      * **AM:** The shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. Therefore, the shortest distance AM is achieved when AM is perpendicular to BC.
      * **MN:** Similarly, the shortest distance MN is achieved when MN is perpendicular to CD.
      * **AN:**  Since ∠BAD = 120°, and ∠B = ∠D = 90°, we know that ∠ABC = ∠ADC = 60°.  Therefore, triangles ABM and ADN are 30-60-90 triangles. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is √3 times the length of the shorter leg.  This means that AM = BM/√3 and AN = DN/√3.

   * **Step 3: Minimizing the perimeter**
      * The perimeter of triangle AMN is AM + MN + AN.
      * Substituting the values we found in Step 2:  Perimeter = BM/√3 + MN + DN/√3.
      * To minimize the perimeter, we need to minimize BM + MN + DN.
      * Since BM + MN + DN is the length of the line segment BCN, the shortest possible length of BCN is when B, M, N, and C are collinear.

   * **Step 4: Finding the angles**
      * When B, M, N, and C are collinear, ∠AMN and ∠ANM are supplementary angles (they add up to 180°).
      * Since ∠ABC = ∠ADC = 60°, and ∠AMN and ∠ANM are supplementary, we have:
         * ∠AMN = 180° - 60° = 120°

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the angles that are corresponding angles.
      * Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection of a transversal with parallel lines.
      * In this image, the angle marked *2x + 6* and the angle marked *3/5y + 2* are corresponding angles.
   * **Step 2:**  Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate.
      * The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the corresponding angles are congruent (equal).
      * Therefore, we can set the expressions for the two corresponding angles equal to each other: 
         * 2x + 6 = 3/5y + 2
   * **Step 3:**  Solve for *y*.
      * Since we are only asked to find *y*, we can treat *x* as a constant.
      * Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
         * 2x + 4 = 3/5y
      * Multiply both sides of the equation by 5/3:

We are given that CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle E.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Find angle ACB.**
      * Since CD bisects angle BCA, we know that angle ACD is equal to angle BCD.
      * We also know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle ACB = 180 degrees - angle A - angle B = 180 degrees - 22 degrees - 22 degrees = 136 degrees.
      * Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle ACD = angle BCD = 136 degrees / 2 = 68 degrees.

   * **Step 2: Find angle DCG.**
      * We know that angle CGF is 88 degrees.
      * We also know that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle DCG = 180 degrees - angle CGF = 180 degrees - 88 degrees = 92 degrees.

   * **Step 3: Find angle DCE.**
      * We know that angle ACD is 68 degrees and angle DCG is 92 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle DCE = angle ACD + angle DCG = 68 degrees + 92 degrees = 160 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Find angle E.**
      * Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, we know that angle E is equal to angle C.
      * We also know that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle E = 180 degrees - angle DCE - angle F = 180 degrees - 160 degrees - 22 degrees = 0 degrees.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
      * We know that angle BCD is 25 degrees.
      * We also know that AB is a diameter, which means angle AOB is a straight angle (180 degrees).
      * Since C and D are on the circle, angles ACD and ABD are inscribed angles.
      * Inscribed angles that intercept the same arc are equal.

   * **Step 2: Find the measure of angle ACD.**
      * Angle ACD intercepts the same arc as angle BCD.
      * Therefore, angle ACD = angle BCD = 25 degrees.

   * **Step 3: Find the measure of angle ABD.**
      * Angle ABD intercepts the same arc as angle ACD.
      * Therefore, angle ABD = angle ACD = 25 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Find the measure of angle AOD.**
      * Angle AOD is an exterior angle of triangle ABD.
      * The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
      * Therefore, angle AOD = angle ABD + angle BAD.
      * Since angle BAD is half of angle AOB (because it intercepts the same arc), angle BAD = 1/2 * 180 degrees = 90 degrees.
      * So, angle AOD = 25 degrees + 90 degrees = 115 degrees.

We are given that A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, and A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ. We need to find the measure of angle PAQ.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Understand symmetry.**
      * Symmetry means that if you fold the figure along the line of symmetry, the two halves will perfectly overlap.
      * Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, this means that line MP is the perpendicular bisector of line AB.
      * Similarly, line NQ is the perpendicular bisector of line AC.

   * **Step 2: Visualize the symmetry.**
      * Imagine folding the triangle along line MP. Point A would land on point B, and vice versa.
      * Similarly, folding along line NQ would make point A coincide with point C.

   * **Step 3: Analyze the angles.**
      * Since line MP is the perpendicular bisector of AB, angle AMP is a right angle (90 degrees).
      * Similarly, angle ANQ is a right angle.
      * We are given that angle BAC is 110 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Use angle properties.**
      * The angles around a point add up to 360 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle PAM + angle MAP + angle BAC = 360 degrees.
      * Substituting the known values, we get: angle PAM + 90 degrees + 110 degrees = 360 degrees.
      * Solving for angle PAM, we get: angle PAM = 160 degrees.

   * **Step 5: Find angle PAQ.**
      * Since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, angle PAQ is half of angle PAM.
      * Therefore, angle PAQ = angle PAM / 2 = 160 degrees / 2 = 80 degrees.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Understand equilateral triangles.** An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal in length.
   * **Step 2: Set up an equation.** Since all sides are equal, we can set the expressions for the lengths of any two sides equal to each other. Let's use sides QR and QS:

The triangle has a 30-degree angle, and the angle formed by the triangle and line l2 is 76 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 2.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify the relevant angles.**
      * We know that angle 1 is 76 degrees.
      * We know that the triangle has a 30-degree angle.
      * We need to find angle 2.

   * **Step 2: Understand the relationship between angles.**
      * **Corresponding angles:** When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal. In this case, angle 1 and the angle inside the triangle that is adjacent to the 30-degree angle are corresponding angles.
      * **Angles in a triangle:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.

   * **Step 3: Calculate the missing angle in the triangle.**
      * Since angle 1 and the angle adjacent to the 30-degree angle are corresponding angles, they are equal. Therefore, the angle adjacent to the 30-degree angle is also 76 degrees.
      * Using the angle sum property of triangles, we can find the third angle in the triangle: 180 degrees - 30 degrees - 76 degrees = 74 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Calculate angle 2.**
      * Angle 2 is supplementary to the 74-degree angle we just calculated. Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees.

We are asked to find the value of x, given that the angle formed by the tangent line and the chord is 30 degrees, the angle formed by the two chords is 3x degrees, and the angle formed by the two chords and the circle's circumference is (4x + 50) degrees.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric relationships.
      * The angle formed by the tangent line and the chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.
      * The angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

   * **Step 2:** Apply the first relationship to find the measure of the intercepted arc for the tangent line and chord.
      * Formula:  Angle = (1/2) * Arc
      * Explanation: This formula states that the angle formed by a tangent line and a chord is half the measure of the arc intercepted by the tangent line and chord.
      * Calculation: 30 degrees = (1/2) * Arc
      * Result: Arc = 60 degrees

   * **Step 3:** Apply the second relationship to find the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs for the two chords.
      * Formula: Angle = (1/2) * (Arc1 + Arc2)
      * Explanation: This formula states that the angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two chords.
      * Calculation: 3x degrees = (1/2) * (Arc1 + Arc2)
      * Result: Arc1 + Arc2 = 6x degrees

   * **Step 4:** Use the fact that the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs for the two chords is equal to the measure of the entire circle (360 degrees) to find the measure of the second intercepted arc.
      * Calculation: Arc1 + Arc2 = 6x degrees = 360 degrees - 60 degrees = 300 degrees
      * Result: Arc2 = 300 degrees - 60 degrees = 240 degrees

   * **Step 5:** Apply the second relationship again to find the value of x.
      * Formula: Angle = (1/2) * (Arc1 + Arc2)
      * Explanation: This formula states that the angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two chords.
      * Calculation: (4x + 50) degrees = (1/2) * (60 degrees + 240 degrees)
      * Result: 4x + 50 = 150

   * **Step 6:** Solve for x.
      * Calculation: 4x = 100
      * Result: x = 25

3. **Answer:** x = 25. 

We can double-check our answer by plugging it back into the original problem. The angle formed by the two chords would be 3 * 25 = 75 degrees. The angle formed by the two chords and the circle's circumference would be (4 * 25 + 50) = 150 degrees. The sum of these two angles is 225 degrees, which is half the sum of the intercepted arcs (60 degrees + 240 degrees = 300 degrees). This confirms that our answer is correct.

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1: Understand the concept of center of mass.**
      * The center of mass is the point where the entire mass of an object can be considered to be concentrated. For a symmetrical object with uniform density, the center of mass is at its geometric center.

      * The isosceles right triangle is symmetrical about its vertical axis (the y-axis).
   * **Step 3: Determine the y-coordinate of the geometric center.**
      * The y-coordinate of the geometric center is simply the height of the triangle divided by 3. This is because the center of mass of a triangle lies at a point that is one-third of the distance from the base to the apex.

The problem asks us to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b'.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Simplify the circuit.**
      * **Reasoning:** We can simplify the circuit by considering a smaller section of it. Since the chain is infinite, the resistance beyond a certain point will be the same as the resistance of the entire chain.
      * **Formula:** None needed.
      * **Calculation:** Let's focus on the first three resistors. We can see that the top three resistors are in series, and the bottom three resistors are also in series. 
      * **Result:** The equivalent resistance of the top three resistors is 3R, and the equivalent resistance of the bottom three resistors is also 3R.

   * **Step 2: Combine the series resistances.**
      * **Reasoning:** The two equivalent resistances (3R each) are now in parallel with each other.
      * **Formula:** For resistors in parallel, the equivalent resistance (R_eq) is calculated as: 1/R_eq = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ...
      * **Calculation:** 1/R_eq = 1/(3R) + 1/(3R) = 2/(3R)
      * **Result:** R_eq = (3R)/2

   * **Step 3: Recognize the pattern.**
      * **Reasoning:** The simplified circuit now looks like the original circuit, but with a different equivalent resistance. This means the resistance of the entire infinite chain is equal to the resistance of this simplified section.
      * **Formula:** None needed.
      * **Calculation:** Let's call the resistance of the entire chain 'X'. We know that X is equal to the resistance of the simplified section, which is (3R)/2.
      * **Result:** X = (3R)/2

      * **Reasoning:** We have an equation where X is equal to itself plus a constant. We can solve for X.
      * **Formula:** None needed.
      * **Calculation:** X = (3R)/2 = X + R
      * **Result:** R = (3R)/2 - X

   * **Step 5: Simplify the equation.**
      * **Reasoning:** We can simplify the equation to solve for X.
      * **Formula:** None needed.
      * **Calculation:** 2R = 3R - 2X
      * **Result:** 2X = R

   * **Step 6: Solve for X.**
      * **Reasoning:** We can solve for X by dividing both sides by 2.
      * **Formula:** None needed.
      * **Calculation:** X = R/2
      * **Result:** X = R/2

3. **Answer:** The equivalent resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' is R/2. Since R = 1, the final answer is 1/2. 

**Double-check:** The answer makes sense because the infinite chain of resistors acts like a voltage divider, and the resistance between 'a' and 'b' is half the resistance of each individual resistor.

      * Let the measure of arc *DE* be *y* degrees.
      * According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem: (5*x* - 12) = *y*/2
   * **Step 3:** Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem to angle *DEC*.
      * Angle *DEC* also intercepts arc *DE*.
      * Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem: 3*x* = *y*/2
   * **Step 4:** Set the two expressions for *y*/2 equal to each other.
      * Since both angles intercept the same arc, their measures are equal.
      * Therefore: (5*x* - 12) = 3*x*
   * **Step 5:** Solve for *x*.
      * Subtract 3*x* from both sides: 2*x* - 12 = 0
      * Add 12 to both sides: 2*x* = 12
      * Divide both sides by 2: *x* = 6

3. **Answer:** *x* = 6.  We can double-check our answer by plugging it back into the original expressions for the angles:
   * Angle *DCE*: (5 * 6 - 12) = 18 degrees
   * Angle *DEC*: 3 * 6 = 18 degrees
   * Since both angles are 18 degrees, our answer is correct.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
      * We are given that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. This indicates that line segment GJ is a transversal intersecting lines WJ and YJ, creating proportional segments. This implies that angle WXJ and angle YJZ are corresponding angles and therefore congruent.
      * We are also given that angle WXJ = 130 degrees.
      * We know that angle WZG = 20 degrees.
      * We need to find angle YIZ.

   * **Step 2: Find angle YJZ.**
      * Since angle WXJ and angle YJZ are corresponding angles and congruent, we have angle YJZ = angle WXJ = 130 degrees.

   * **Step 3: Find angle YZI.**
      * Angle YZI and angle WZG are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle YZI = 180 degrees - angle WZG = 180 degrees - 20 degrees = 160 degrees.

   * **Step 4: Find angle YIZ.**
      * Angle YIZ is the interior angle of triangle YIZ, and we know the measures of two other angles: angle YJZ = 130 degrees and angle YZI = 160 degrees.
      * The sum of interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, angle YIZ = 180 degrees - angle YJZ - angle YZI = 180 degrees - 130 degrees - 160 degrees = -110 degrees.

We need to find the length of the external segment of the second secant line, labeled as 'x'.

2. **Solution:**

We are given that angle ABD is 50 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle BCD.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Identify key relationships**
      *  Since AB is the diameter of the circle, angle ACB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem: an inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle is a right angle).
      *  Angle ADB is also a right angle (same reason as above).

   * **Step 2: Apply the angle sum property of triangles**
      * In triangle ABD, we know ∠ABD = 50° and ∠ADB = 90°.  
      * Using the angle sum property of triangles (the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°), we can find ∠BAD:
         * ∠BAD + ∠ABD + ∠ADB = 180°
         * ∠BAD + 50° + 90° = 180°

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Understand the relationship between central angles and intercepted arcs.
      * **Reasoning:** A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Formula:**  Central Angle = Intercepted Arc
      * **Calculation:** In this case, we know the measure of the intercepted arc PQR is 98 degrees. Therefore, the central angle PSQ also measures 98 degrees.

   * **Step 2:** Identify the relationship between the central angle PSQ and the arc PQ.
      * **Reasoning:**  Arc PQ is a part of the larger arc PQR.
      * **Formula:**  Arc PQR = Arc PQ + Arc QR
      * **Calculation:** We know that Arc PQR = 98 degrees. We need to find the measure of Arc PQ.

   * **Step 3:**  Find the measure of arc QR.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since line segment QR is a diameter of the circle, it divides the circle into two semicircles.  A semicircle has a measure of 180 degrees.
      * **Formula:**  Semicircle = 180 degrees
      * **Calculation:** Therefore, Arc QR = 180 degrees.

   * **Step 4:**  Solve for the measure of arc PQ.
      * **Reasoning:**  We can use the formula from Step 2 and substitute the values we know.
      * **Formula:**  Arc PQR = Arc PQ + Arc QR
      * **Calculation:** 98 degrees = Arc PQ + 180 degrees.  Subtracting 180 degrees from both sides, we get Arc PQ = -82 degrees.

2. **Solution:**

   * **Step 1: Find ∠ACD.**
      * **Reasoning:** Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know ∠CGA = 90°.
      * **Formula:**  ∠ACG + ∠ACD = ∠CGA (angles on a straight line)
      * **Calculation:** 32° + ∠ACD = 90°
                         ∠ACD = 90° - 32° = 58°

   * **Step 2: Find ∠BCD.**
      * **Reasoning:** CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, meaning it divides ∠ACB into two equal angles.
      * **Formula:** ∠ACD = ∠BCD (angle bisector property)
      * **Calculation:** ∠BCD = ∠ACD = 58°

   * **Step 3: Find ∠BCF.**
      * **Reasoning:**  ∠BCF is an exterior angle of triangle BFC.
      * **Formula:** ∠BCF = ∠BFC + ∠CBF (exterior angle property)
      * **Calculation:** We don't know ∠CBF yet, so we can't directly calculate ∠BCF.

   * **Step 4: Find ∠BFC.**

      * **Formula:** ∠BFC + ∠BCF + ∠CBF = 180° (angles in a triangle)
      * **Calculation:** We know ∠BCF = ∠BCD + ∠DCF = 58° + ∠DCF.  We also know ∠CBF = ∠EBF + ∠FBE.  Substituting these into the formula:
                         ∠BFC + (58° + ∠DCF) + (∠EBF + ∠FBE) = 180°
                         ∠BFC = 180° - 58° - ∠DCF - ∠EBF - ∠FBE
                         ∠BFC = 122° - ∠DCF - ∠EBF - ∠FBE

   * **Step 5: Simplify the expression for ∠BFC.**
      * **Reasoning:** We can simplify the expression by recognizing that ∠DCF + ∠EBF + ∠FBE = 180° (angles on a straight line).
      * **Calculation:** ∠BFC = 122° - (∠DCF + ∠EBF + ∠FBE)

2. **Solution:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between the angles.
      * The angles *x*, *y*, and 70 degrees form a straight angle.
      * A straight angle measures 180 degrees.
      * Therefore, we can write the equation: *x* + *y* + 70 = 180

   * **Step 3:** Substitute *y* with *x²*.
      * We are given that *y* = *x²*.
      * Substitute this into the equation: *x* + *x²* = 110
   * **Step 4:** Rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation.
      * Subtract 110 from both sides: *x²* + *x* - 110 = 0
   * **Step 5:** Factor the quadratic equation.
      * Find two numbers that add up to 1 (the coefficient of *x*) and multiply to -110 (the constant term).
      * The numbers 11 and -10 satisfy these conditions.
      * Therefore, we can factor the equation as: (*x* + 11)(*x* - 10) = 0
   * **Step 6:** Solve for *x*.
      * For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.
      * Therefore, either *x* + 11 = 0 or *x* - 10 = 0.
      * Solving for *x* in each case, we get: *x* = -11 or *x* = 10.
   * **Step 7:** Determine the valid value of *x*.
      * Since angles cannot be negative, *x* = -11 is not a valid solution.

      * We know that *y* = *x²*.
