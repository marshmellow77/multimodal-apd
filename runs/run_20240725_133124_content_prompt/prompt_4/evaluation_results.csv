643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"**1. Problem Statement:**

In a circle with center O, CD is the diameter, chord DE is parallel to chord OA, and the measure of angle D is 50 degrees. Find the measure of angle C.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1:** Identify relevant angles and relationships.
    * Since CD is a diameter, angle COD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.
    * Angle DCO is half of angle COD because OC and OD are radii of the circle. Therefore, angle DCO measures 90 degrees.
    * Angle DOE is supplementary to angle D, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle DOE measures 130 degrees.
    * Angle AOE is equal to angle DOE because DE is parallel to OA. Therefore, angle AOE also measures 130 degrees.
    * Angle AOC is the sum of angles AOE and EOC.

* **Step 2:** Apply the angle sum property of triangles.
    * In triangle AOC, the sum of angles AOC, ACO, and CAO is 180 degrees.
    * We know angle ACO is 90 degrees and angle AOE is 130 degrees. Therefore, angle CAO measures 180 - 90 - 130 = -40 degrees.

* **Step 3:** Determine the measure of angle C.
    * Angle C is equal to angle CAO because they are alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines DE and OA. Therefore, angle C measures -40 degrees.

**3. Answer:**

The degree of angle C is **-40 degrees**. 

**Note:** The answer is negative because the angle is measured in the clockwise direction. In standard convention, angles are measured counterclockwise, so a negative angle indicates a clockwise rotation.",False,0,3.6699159145355225,803.0
665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"**1. Problem Statement:**

The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees, the side opposite the 60-degree angle having a length of 4, and the hypotenuse having a length of *h*. The problem asks us to find the value of *h*.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio.**
   * We know the side opposite the 60-degree angle (4) and we want to find the hypotenuse (*h*). The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function: sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse.

* **Step 2: Apply the sine function.**
   * In this case, sin(60°) = 4/ *h*.

* **Step 3: Solve for *h*.**
   * We know that sin(60°) = √3/2. Therefore, √3/2 = 4/ *h*.
   * Multiply both sides by *h* to get: √3 *h / 2 = 4.
   * Multiply both sides by 2 to get: √3 *h = 8.
   * Divide both sides by √3 to get: *h* = 8/√3.
   * Rationalize the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by √3: *h* = (8√3) / 3.

**3. Answer:**

The value of *h* is **(8√3) / 3**.

The image shows two lines AB and CD intersecting at point O. Ray OE bisects angle BOC. Given that angle AOD is 70 degrees, find the measure of angle AOE.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1:** Identify the relevant angles.
    * We are given that ∠AOD = 70°.
    * Since ∠AOD and ∠BOD are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), we have ∠BOD = 180° - ∠AOD = 180° - 70° = 110°.
    * Ray OE bisects ∠BOC, meaning ∠BOE = ∠COE.

* **Step 2:** Apply the angle addition postulate.
    * ∠BOD = ∠BOE + ∠EOD.
    * Substituting the known values, we get 110° = ∠BOE + ∠EOD.

* **Step 3:** Use the fact that ∠BOE = ∠COE.
    * Since ∠BOE = ∠COE, we can rewrite the equation from Step 2 as 110° = ∠COE + ∠EOD.

* **Step 4:** Solve for ∠AOE.
    * ∠AOE = ∠AOD + ∠EOD.
    * Substituting the known values, we get ∠AOE = 70° + ∠EOD.
    * From Step 3, we know ∠COE + ∠EOD = 110°. Since ∠COE = ∠BOE, we have ∠BOE + ∠EOD = 110°.
    * Therefore, ∠EOD = 110° - ∠BOE.
    * Substituting this into the equation for ∠AOE, we get ∠AOE = 70° + (110° - ∠BOE) = 180° - ∠BOE.

**3. Answer:**

Since ∠BOE is half of ∠BOC, and ∠BOC is supplementary to ∠AOD, we have ∠BOE = (1/2)(180° - 70°) = 55°.

Therefore, ∠AOE = 180° - ∠BOE = 180° - 55° = **125°**.",False,0,5.013952970504761,937.0
294,"In Fig. 21-25, the particles have charges $q_1=-q_2=100 \mathrm{nC}$ and $q_3=-q_4=200 \mathrm{nC}$, and distance $a=$ $5.0 \mathrm{~cm}$. What is the $x$ component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3?",0.17,"**1. Problem Statement:**

Four charged particles are arranged at the corners of a square with side length 'a'. The charges are as follows:
* q1 = -100 nC
* q2 = 100 nC
* q3 = -200 nC
* q4 = 200 nC

The distance 'a' is 5.0 cm. The problem asks for the x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3.

**2. Solution:**

**Step 1: Identify the forces acting on particle 3.**

Particle 3 experiences electrostatic forces due to the other three particles:
* **Force due to q1 (F13):** This force is attractive (opposite charges) and acts along the diagonal of the square.
* **Force due to q2 (F23):** This force is repulsive (same charges) and acts horizontally to the right.
* **Force due to q4 (F43):** This force is repulsive (same charges) and acts vertically upwards.

**Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of each force.**

We can use Coulomb's Law to calculate the magnitude of each force:

* F = k * |q1 * q2| / r^2

Where:
* k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2)
* q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges
* r is the distance between the charges

* **F13:**
    * r = a * sqrt(2) (diagonal of the square)
    * F13 = (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (100 * 10^-9 C) * (200 * 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m * sqrt(2))^2
    * F13 ≈ 0.036 N

* **F23:**
    * r = a
    * F23 = (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (100 * 10^-9 C) * (200 * 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m)^2
    * F23 ≈ 0.072 N

* **F43:**
    * r = a
    * F43 = (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (200 * 10^-9 C) * (200 * 10^-9 C) / (0.05 m)^2
    * F43 ≈ 0.144 N

**Step 3: Determine the x-component of each force.**

* **F13:** The x-component of F13 is F13 * cos(45°) ≈ 0.025 N (since the angle between F13 and the x-axis is 45 degrees).
* **F23:** The x-component of F23 is F23 = 0.072 N (since F23 is entirely along the x-axis).
* **F43:** The x-component of F43 is 0 N (since F43 is entirely along the y-axis).

**Step 4: Calculate the net x-component of the force.**

The net x-component of the force on particle 3 is the sum of the x-components of all the forces:

* F_net_x = F13_x + F23_x + F43_x
* F_net_x ≈ 0.025 N + 0.072 N + 0 N
* F_net_x ≈ 0.097 N

**3. Answer:**

The x-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is approximately 0.097 N.

    * BC = √((4-0)² + (1-0)²) = √17
    * AC = √((4-1)² + (1-4)²) = √18

4. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ABC:**

    * This confirms that triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle.

5. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ABD:**
    * AB² = AD² + BD²
    * (√17)² = AD² + BD²
    * 17 = AD² + BD²

6. **Find the length of BD:**
    * BD is the difference in the x-coordinates of points B and D.
    * Since point D lies on the line BC, its x-coordinate is the same as that of point C, which is 4.
    * Therefore, BD = 4 - 0 = 4.

The problem presents a circle with center O, and two tangents PA and PB drawn from an external point P to the circle. Points C and D are moving points on PA and PB respectively, such that CD is always tangent to the circle. Given that PA = 8.0, the problem asks to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify key properties**

   * Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.
   * The line segment joining the point of contact of a tangent to the center of the circle is perpendicular to the tangent. Hence, OA ⊥ PA and OB ⊥ PB.

* **Step 2: Analyze the triangle**

   * Triangle PCD is formed by the tangents PA and PB and the tangent CD.
   * Since OA ⊥ PA and OB ⊥ PB, we can conclude that ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90°.
   * Also, ∠COD = 90° as CD is tangent to the circle.

* **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem**

   * In right-angled triangle OAC, we have:
      * AC² = OA² + OC²
   * Similarly, in right-angled triangle OBD, we have:
      * BD² = OB² + OD²
   * Since OA = OB (radii of the same circle) and OC = OD (radii of the same circle), we can conclude that AC = BD.

* **Step 4: Calculate the perimeter**

   * Perimeter of triangle PCD = PC + CD + PD
   * Substituting PC = PA - AC and PD = PB - BD, we get:
      * Perimeter = (PA - AC) + CD + (PB - BD)
      * Perimeter = PA + PB + CD - (AC + BD)
      * Since AC = BD, the perimeter simplifies to:
      * Perimeter = PA + PB + CD

* **Step 5: Final calculation**

   * We know PA = PB = 8.0.
   * The length of CD is not provided, but it is constant as it is always tangent to the circle.
   * Therefore, the perimeter of triangle PCD is 8.0 + 8.0 + CD = 16.0 + CD.

The problem asks us to find the length of segment $JQ$ in triangle $JLN$, given that $Q$ is the incenter of the triangle and $JL = 16.5$.

**2. Solution:**

* **Understanding the Incenter:** The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. It is also the center of the triangle's inscribed circle, which means it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.

* **Using the Incenter Property:** Since $Q$ is the incenter, we know that $JQ$ is the distance from the incenter to side $JL$.  This distance is also equal to the radius of the inscribed circle.

* **Finding the Radius:** To find the radius of the inscribed circle, we can use the formula:

   *  $r = \frac{A}{s}$

   where:
     * $r$ is the radius of the inscribed circle
     * $A$ is the area of the triangle
     * $s$ is the semiperimeter of the triangle (half the perimeter)

* **Finding the Area:** We need to find the area of triangle $JLN$.  We can do this by using the formula:

   * $A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot h$

   where:
     * $A$ is the area of the triangle
     * $b$ is the base of the triangle
     * $h$ is the height of the triangle

   We are given $JL = 16.5$.  We need to find the height of the triangle.  Notice that the height of the triangle is the same as the length of segment $QN$.  We can find $QN$ using the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $QMN$:

   * $QN = \sqrt{QM^2 + MN^2} = \sqrt{9^2 + 9^2} = 9\sqrt{2}$

* **Finding the Semiperimeter:** The semiperimeter of the triangle is:

   * $s = \frac{JL + LN + JN}{2}$

   We are given $JL = 16.5$.  We need to find $LN$ and $JN$.  We can find $LN$ using the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $KLN$:

   * $LN = \sqrt{KL^2 + KN^2} = \sqrt{9^2 + (9\sqrt{2})^2} = 9\sqrt{3}$

   We can find $JN$ using the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $JQN$:

   * $JN = \sqrt{JQ^2 + QN^2} = \sqrt{JQ^2 + (9\sqrt{2})^2}$

* **Putting it Together:** Now we can find the radius of the inscribed circle:

   * $r = \frac{A}{s} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot JL \cdot QN}{\frac{JL + LN + JN}{2}} = \frac{16.5 \cdot 9\sqrt{2}}{16.5 + 9\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{JQ^2 + (9\sqrt{2})^2}}$

In triangle ABC, the perpendicular bisector of AB intersects AB at point D and BC at point E. AE is connected. If AB = 6 and the perimeter of triangle ACE is 13, find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the problem:** We are given a triangle ABC with a perpendicular bisector of AB. We know the length of AB and the perimeter of triangle ACE. We need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

2. **Key properties:**
    * **Perpendicular bisector:** A perpendicular bisector of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts and is perpendicular to it.
    * **Isosceles triangle:** A triangle with two equal sides is called an isosceles triangle. The angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.

3. **Applying the properties:**
    * Since DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, we have AD = DB = AB/2 = 3.
    * Triangle ADE is a right-angled triangle with AD = 3 and AE as the hypotenuse.
    * Triangle BDE is also a right-angled triangle with BD = 3 and BE as the hypotenuse.
    * Since DE is common to both triangles ADE and BDE, and AD = BD, we can conclude that AE = BE.
    * Therefore, triangle ABE is an isosceles triangle with AE = BE.

4. **Finding the missing sides:**
    * Perimeter of triangle ACE = AC + CE + AE = 13.
    * Since AE = BE, we can write the perimeter of triangle ABC as AB + BC + AC = AB + (BE + CE) + AC = AB + BC + AE + CE = AB + perimeter of triangle ACE = 6 + 13 = 19.

628,如图，在ABCD中，∠ABC的平分线交AD于点E，∠BCD的平分线交AD于点F，若AB＝3，AD＝4，则EF的长是（）,2,"**1. Problem Statement:**

In parallelogram ABCD, the angle bisector of ∠ABC intersects AD at point E, and the angle bisector of ∠BCD intersects AD at point F. If AB = 3 and AD = 4, find the length of EF.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Analyze the properties of the parallelogram.**
   * In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore, AB = CD = 3 and AD = BC = 4.
   * Opposite angles are equal. Therefore, ∠ABC = ∠ADC and ∠BAD = ∠BCD.

* **Step 2: Apply the angle bisector theorem.**
   * The angle bisector theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides.
   * Applying this to triangle ABC, we have AE/EC = AB/BC = 3/4.
   * Applying this to triangle BCD, we have DF/FB = CD/BC = 3/4.

* **Step 3: Use the properties of parallel lines.**
   * Since AB || CD, we have ∠BAE = ∠DCE (alternate interior angles).
   * Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE.
   * Therefore, ∠ABE + ∠BAE = ∠CBE + ∠DCE, which implies ∠AEB = ∠CED.
   * Similarly, we can prove that ∠AFD = ∠BFC.

* **Step 4: Apply the AA similarity criterion.**
   * Triangles AEB and CED have two pairs of equal angles (∠AEB = ∠CED and ∠BAE = ∠DCE), so they are similar.
   * Triangles AFD and BFC have two pairs of equal angles (∠AFD = ∠BFC and ∠FAD = ∠FBC), so they are similar.

* **Step 5: Use the properties of similar triangles.**
   * Since triangles AEB and CED are similar, we have AE/CE = AB/CD = 3/3 = 1.
   * Since triangles AFD and BFC are similar, we have DF/FB = CD/BC = 3/4.

* **Step 6: Calculate EF.**
   * From the above equations, we have AE = CE and DF = (3/4)FB.
   * Since AD = AE + EF + FD = 4, we have EF = AD - AE - FD = 4 - CE - (3/4)FB.
   * Substituting CE = AE and FB = (4/3)DF, we get EF = 4 - AE - (3/4)(4/3)DF = 4 - AE - DF.
   * Since AE = CE and DF = (3/4)FB, we have EF = 4 - CE - (3/4)FB = 4 - (1/2)AD = 4 - (1/2)(4) = 2.

The length of EF is **2**.",True,1,6.049016714096069,1100.0

In the given figure, lines AB and CD intersect at point O. Line OD bisects ∠AOE, and ∠BOC = 50°. Find the measure of ∠EOB.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1:** Identify the relevant angles.
    * We are given ∠BOC = 50°.
    * We need to find ∠EOB.
    * Since OD bisects ∠AOE, we know that ∠AOD = ∠DOE.

* **Step 2:** Apply the concept of vertically opposite angles.
    * ∠BOC and ∠AOD are vertically opposite angles, so they are equal. Therefore, ∠AOD = ∠BOC = 50°.

* **Step 3:** Apply the concept of angles on a straight line.
    * ∠AOD + ∠DOE + ∠EOB = 180° (angles on a straight line)
    * Since ∠AOD = ∠DOE = 50°, we can substitute: 50° + 50° + ∠EOB = 180°

* **Step 4:** Solve for ∠EOB.
    * 100° + ∠EOB = 180°

The problem asks to find the length of segment CD in trapezoid ABCD, given that AB = 24, AD = 23, and BC = 16.

**2. Solution:**

* **Understanding the Trapezoid:** A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. In this case, AB and CD are parallel.

* **Constructing a Right Triangle:**  Draw a perpendicular line from point C to line AD, intersecting AD at point E. This creates a right triangle BCE.

* **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**  In right triangle BCE, we know BC = 16 and BE = AB - AD = 24 - 23 = 1.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find CE:
    * BC² = BE² + CE²
    * 16² = 1² + CE²
    * CE² = 256 - 1 = 255
    * CE = √255

In the given figure, point P lies outside circle O. Lines PA and PB intersect the circle at points C and D, respectively. The central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees, and the central angle of arc CD is 50 degrees. Determine the measure of angle P.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Find the measure of angle ACB.**
   * Since the central angle of arc AB is 90 degrees, the inscribed angle ACB is half of that measure.
   * Therefore, ∠ACB = 90°/2 = 45°.

* **Step 2: Find the measure of angle ADB.**

A square is inscribed in a circle of area 18π square units. Find the length of a side of the square.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Find the radius of the circle.**
   The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius. We are given that the area of the circle is 18π square units.  Substituting this into the formula, we get:
   18π = πr²
   Dividing both sides by π, we get:
   18 = r²
   Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
   r = √18 = 3√2

* **Step 2: Relate the radius to the diagonal of the square.**
   The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. The diameter is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is 2 * 3√2 = 6√2.

* **Step 3: Find the side length of the square.**
   The diagonal of a square divides it into two 45-45-90 right triangles. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the ratio of the hypotenuse (diagonal of the square) to a leg (side of the square) is √2:1.  Therefore, the side length of the square is (6√2) / √2 = 6.

In a circle with center O, AB is the diameter, CD is a chord, and ∠ADC = 26°. Find the measure of ∠CAB.

    * Since AB is the diameter, ∠ACB is a right angle (inscribed angle theorem).
    * ∠ADC and ∠ABC are inscribed angles subtending the same arc (arc AC). Therefore, they are equal.

* **Step 2:** Apply the angle sum property of triangles.
    * In triangle ADC, ∠ADC + ∠DAC + ∠ACD = 180°.
    * We know ∠ADC = 26° and ∠ACD = 90° (from step 1).
    * Therefore, ∠DAC = 180° - 26° - 90° = 64°.

* **Step 3:** Use the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180°.
    * ∠CAB + ∠DAC = 180°.

In the given figure, PA and PB are tangents to circle O, with points A and B as the points of tangency. AC is the diameter of circle O. Given that angle P is 50 degrees, find the measure of angle ACB.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify key properties.**
    * Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB.
    * The angle between a tangent and a radius drawn to the point of tangency is 90 degrees. Hence, ∠OAB = ∠OBA = 90 degrees.
    * The angle subtended by a diameter at any point on the circle is 90 degrees. Therefore, ∠ACB = 90 degrees.

* **Step 2: Apply the properties to find the angles in triangle PAB.**
    * Since PA = PB, triangle PAB is an isosceles triangle. Therefore, ∠PAB = ∠PBA.
    * The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, ∠PAB + ∠PBA + ∠P = 180 degrees.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant geometric relationships.**
    * Since CD is tangent to circle O at point C, ∠OCB is a right angle (90°). This is because the radius of a circle is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of tangency.

    * **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

* **Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem to find the measure of arc AB.**
    * Since ∠C is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AB, we have:
        * ∠C = (1/2) * measure of arc AB
    * Therefore, the measure of arc AB = 2 * ∠C = 2 * 35° = 70°.

* **Step 3: Apply the Central Angle Theorem to find the measure of ∠AOB.**
    * ∠AOB is a central angle intercepting arc AB.

In the given circle with center O, diameter CD intersects chord EF at its midpoint G.  Given that ∠DCF = 20°, find the measure of ∠EOD.

**Step 1: Identify relevant properties**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Properties of a diameter:** A diameter bisects a circle and forms two right angles with any chord it intersects.

**Step 2: Apply the properties**

* Since G is the midpoint of EF, we know that EG = GF.
* Since CD is a diameter, ∠CED and ∠CFD are right angles.

Quadrilateral ABDC is a rectangle. If the measure of angle 1 is 38 degrees, find the measure of angle 2.

A square is inscribed in a circle. The problem asks to find the measure of a central angle of the circle.

## 2. Solution:

* **Step 1:**  Identify the central angle. 
    * A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. In this case, the central angle is formed by connecting the center of the circle (point K) to two adjacent vertices of the square (for example, points A and B).

* **Step 2:**  Recognize the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle.
    * An inscribed angle is an angle whose vertex lies on the circle and whose sides are chords of the circle. In this case, angle ABC is an inscribed angle.
    * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. The intercepted arc for angle ABC is arc AB.

* **Step 3:**  Determine the measure of the intercepted arc.
    * Since the square is inscribed in the circle, each side of the square is a chord of the circle.  
    * The intercepted arc for each side of the square is one-fourth of the entire circle.
    * Therefore, the measure of arc AB is 360 degrees / 4 = 90 degrees.

* **Step 4:**  Calculate the measure of the central angle.
    * The central angle KAB intercepts the same arc AB as the inscribed angle ABC.
    * Therefore, the measure of central angle KAB is twice the measure of inscribed angle ABC.
    * Since angle ABC is an angle of a square, it measures 90 degrees.
    * So, the measure of central angle KAB is 2 * 90 degrees = 180 degrees.

256,如图，△ABC中，AD平分∠BAC，AD交BC于点D，DE⊥AB，垂足为E，若DE＝3，AC＝4，则△ADC的面积为（）,6,"## Problem Statement:

In triangle ABC, AD bisects angle BAC and intersects BC at point D. DE is perpendicular to AB, with E as the foot of the perpendicular. Given DE = 3 and AC = 4, find the area of triangle ADC.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the problem:** We are given a triangle ABC with an angle bisector AD and a perpendicular DE. We need to find the area of triangle ADC.

2. **Using the angle bisector theorem:** Since AD bisects angle BAC, we can apply the angle bisector theorem. This theorem states that the ratio of the sides opposite the bisected angles is equal to the ratio of the segments created by the bisector. In our case, this means:

   ```
   BD/DC = AB/AC
   ```

3. **Finding AB:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle ADE to find AB:

   ```
   AB² = AE² + DE²
   ```

   Since DE = 3 and AE is unknown, we need to find AE. We can use the fact that DE is perpendicular to AB and AD is an angle bisector. This means that triangle ADE is similar to triangle ADC. Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal:

   ```
   AE/AC = DE/DC
   ```

   We know AC = 4 and DE = 3. We can substitute these values and solve for AE:

   ```
   AE/4 = 3/DC
   AE = 12/DC
   ```

   Now we can substitute this value of AE in the Pythagorean theorem:

   ```
   AB² = (12/DC)² + 3²
   AB² = 144/DC² + 9
   ```

4. **Finding DC:** We can use the fact that BD + DC = BC. We can also use the angle bisector theorem to express BD in terms of DC:

   ```
   BD/DC = AB/AC
   BD = (AB/AC) * DC
   ```

   Substituting this in the equation BD + DC = BC, we get:

   ```
   (AB/AC) * DC + DC = BC
   DC * (AB/AC + 1) = BC
   ```

   We know AC = 4 and BC is unknown. We can substitute the value of AB from step 3:

   ```
   DC * (√(144/DC² + 9)/4 + 1) = BC
   ```

   We can solve this equation for DC. However, since we only need the area of triangle ADC, we can directly use the formula for the area of a triangle:

   ```
   Area of triangle ADC = (1/2) * AC * DE
   ```

5. **Calculating the area:** We know AC = 4 and DE = 3. Substituting these values, we get:

    * We need to find ∠C.
    * Notice that ∠AEC and ∠CED are supplementary angles (they form a straight line).

* **Step 2: Calculate ∠CED.**
    * Since ∠AEC and ∠CED are supplementary, we have:
        ∠CED = 180.0 degrees - ∠AEC = 180.0 degrees - 105.0 degrees = 75.0 degrees.

* **Step 3: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.**

* **Step 5: Calculate ∠C.**
    * Since ∠CED intercepts arc AC, we have:

A circle with center B has a diameter of 8. A chord CE is drawn with a length of 13.5. Find the length of BD, which is the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the chord.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant geometric relationships.**
    * We know that the diameter of the circle is 8, so the radius (AB or BE) is 4.
    * Since BD is perpendicular to CE, it bisects CE. Therefore, CD = DE = 13.5/2 = 6.75.

In the given circle with center O, points A, B, and C lie on the circumference.  AO is parallel to BC, and angle AOB is 40 degrees.  We need to find the measure of angle OAC.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify relevant angles and relationships.**
    * Since AO is parallel to BC, we have alternate interior angles: ∠OAC = ∠ACO.
    * The angle at the center of the circle, ∠AOB, is twice the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc AB: ∠AOB = 2∠ACB.

* **Step 2: Calculate ∠ACB.**
    * We know ∠AOB = 40 degrees.
    * Using the relationship from Step 1, ∠ACB = ∠AOB / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20 degrees.

* **Step 3: Calculate ∠OAC.**
    * Since ∠OAC = ∠ACO, and the angles in triangle OAC add up to 180 degrees, we have:
    * ∠OAC + ∠ACO + ∠COA = 180 degrees
    * 2∠OAC + ∠COA = 180 degrees
    * ∠COA = 180 degrees - 2∠OAC
    * We also know that ∠COA = ∠AOB + ∠BOC = 40 degrees + ∠BOC.
    * Therefore, 40 degrees + ∠BOC = 180 degrees - 2∠OAC.
    * Solving for ∠OAC, we get:

    * ∠OAC = (140 degrees - ∠BOC) / 2

* **Step 4: Determine ∠BOC.**
    * Since ∠ACB = 20 degrees, and ∠ACB + ∠BOC = 180 degrees (angles on a straight line), we have:

In parallelogram ABCD, diagonals AC and BD intersect at point O. Given AC = 12.0, BD = 8.0, and AB = 7.0, find the perimeter of triangle OAB.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.**
   * In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. This means that point O is the midpoint of both AC and BD.
   * Therefore, AO = CO = AC/2 = 12.0/2 = 6.0

In quadrilateral ABCD, ∠BAD = 120°, ∠B = ∠D = 90°. Points M and N are on BC and CD respectively, such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized. Find the degree measure of ∠AMN + ∠ANM.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Constructing a reflection**
   Reflect point A across line BC to get point A'. Since ∠B = 90°, line BC is the perpendicular bisector of AA'. Therefore, AB = A'B and ∠ABM = ∠A'BM.

* **Step 2: Analyzing the perimeter**
   The perimeter of triangle AMN is AM + MN + NA. Since AM = A'M, the perimeter can be rewritten as A'M + MN + NA. This is the same as the length of the path A'MNA.

* **Step 3: Minimizing the perimeter**
   The shortest path from A' to N is a straight line. Therefore, to minimize the perimeter of triangle AMN, points M and N should be chosen such that A'MN is a straight line.

* **Step 4: Finding the angles**
   Since A'MN is a straight line, ∠A'MA + ∠AMN = 180°. Also, ∠A'MA = ∠AMB (due to reflection). Therefore, ∠AMB + ∠AMN = 180°.

   Similarly, ∠AND + ∠ANM = 180°.

* **Step 5: Calculating the sum of angles**
   Adding the two equations from Step 4, we get:
   ∠AMB + ∠AMN + ∠AND + ∠ANM = 360°

   Since ∠AMB + ∠AND = ∠BAD = 120°, we have:
   120° + ∠AMN + ∠ANM = 360°

The image shows three parallel lines intersected by two transversals. The angles formed by the intersection of the transversals and the parallel lines are labeled with expressions involving x and y. The problem asks to find the value of y.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify corresponding angles.**
   The angles labeled 2x + 6 and 3/5y + 2 are corresponding angles because they occupy the same relative position at the intersection of a transversal and two parallel lines.

* **Step 2: Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate.**
   The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that corresponding angles formed by parallel lines and a transversal are congruent (equal in measure). Therefore, we can set the expressions for the corresponding angles equal to each other:
   2x + 6 = 3/5y + 2

* **Step 3: Identify another pair of corresponding angles.**
   The angles labeled 20 - 5x and -y are also corresponding angles.

* **Step 4: Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate again.**
   Setting the expressions for these corresponding angles equal to each other:
   20 - 5x = -y

* **Step 5: Solve for y.**
   We have two equations with two unknowns (x and y). We can solve for y by eliminating x.  
   * From the second equation, we can express x in terms of y:
     x = (20 + y) / 5
   * Substitute this expression for x into the first equation:
     2[(20 + y) / 5] + 6 = 3/5y + 2
   * Simplify and solve for y:
     (40 + 2y) / 5 + 6 = 3/5y + 2
     40 + 2y + 30 = 3y + 10
     70 = y + 10

Given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, CD bisects angle BCA, angle A is 22 degrees, and angle CGF is 88 degrees, find the measure of angle E.

## Solution:

1. **Congruent Triangles:** Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, angle E is equal to angle B.

2. **Angle Bisector:** CD bisects angle BCA, meaning angle BCD is equal to angle ACD.

3. **Angle Sum Property:** The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Applying this to triangle ABC, we have: angle A + angle B + angle C = 180 degrees.

4. **Angle Relationships:**  Angle CGF is an exterior angle of triangle BCD. Therefore, angle CGF is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles: angle BCD + angle CBD.

5. **Solving for Angle B:**
    * We know angle A = 22 degrees.
    * We know angle CGF = 88 degrees.
    * We know angle BCD = angle ACD (angle bisector).
    * Using the angle sum property of triangle ABC, we can find angle C: angle C = 180 - angle A - angle B = 180 - 22 - angle B = 158 - angle B.
    * Using the exterior angle property, we can find angle CBD: angle CBD = angle CGF - angle BCD = 88 - angle BCD.
    * Since angle BCD = angle ACD, we can substitute to get: angle CBD = 88 - angle ACD.
    * Now, we can apply the angle sum property to triangle BCD: angle BCD + angle CBD + angle BDC = 180 degrees.
    * Substituting the values we found: angle ACD + (88 - angle ACD) + angle BDC = 180 degrees.
    * Simplifying, we get: angle BDC = 92 degrees.
    * Finally, applying the angle sum property to triangle ABC again: angle A + angle B + angle C = 180 degrees.

**2. Solution:**

* **Symmetry and Angles:** Since A and B are symmetrical with respect to line MP, we have ∠AMP = ∠BMP. Similarly, since A and C are symmetrical with respect to line NQ, we have ∠ANQ = ∠CNQ.

* **Angle Relationships:**  In triangle ABP, we have ∠ABP + ∠BAP + ∠BPA = 180°. Since ∠BAP = ∠BAC/2 = 55° (due to symmetry), we can write: ∠ABP + 55° + ∠BPA = 180°.

* **Angle Relationships (cont.):** Similarly, in triangle ACQ, we have ∠ACQ + ∠CAQ + ∠CQA = 180°. Since ∠CAQ = ∠BAC/2 = 55°, we can write: ∠ACQ + 55° + ∠CQA = 180°.

* **Angle Sum:** Now, consider the quadrilateral PAQN. The sum of its interior angles is 360°. Therefore, ∠PAQ + ∠AQN + ∠QNP + ∠NPA = 360°.

* **Substitution:** Substituting the values we found earlier: ∠PAQ + (180° - ∠ACQ - 55°) + (180° - ∠ABP - 55°) + ∠BPA + ∠QNP = 360°.

* **Simplifying:** Simplifying the equation, we get: ∠PAQ + ∠BPA + ∠QNP = 110°.

The image shows a circle with chords $\overline{GH}$ and $\overline{KJ}$.  We are given that $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$ and $\angle GJH = 83^\circ$ and $\angle KJH = (2x - 27)^\circ$. We need to find the value of $x$.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**
   Since $\overline{CH} \cong \overline{KJ}$, we know that the corresponding arcs are congruent: $\widehat{CH} \cong \widehat{KJ}$.  This is because congruent chords subtend congruent arcs in a circle.

* **Step 2: Apply the theorem to find the measure of the arc.**
   The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle.  Therefore, $\angle CLJ$ is the central angle for both $\widehat{CH}$ and $\widehat{KJ}$.  Since $\widehat{CH} \cong \widehat{KJ}$, we have $\angle CLJ = \angle CLJ$.

* **Step 3: Use the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.**
   An inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.  Therefore, $\angle GJH = \frac{1}{2} \angle CLJ$ and $\angle KJH = \frac{1}{2} \angle CLJ$.

* **Step 4: Set up an equation and solve for x.**
   Since $\angle GJH = 83^\circ$ and $\angle KJH = (2x - 27)^\circ$, we can write:
   
   ```
   83^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \angle CLJ
   (2x - 27)^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \angle CLJ
   ```

   Since both expressions are equal to $\frac{1}{2} \angle CLJ$, we can set them equal to each other:

   ```
   83^\circ = (2x - 27)^\circ
   ```

   Solving for $x$, we get:

   83 + 27 = 2x

The image shows a circle with two chords intersecting inside the circle. One of the angles formed by the intersection is labeled as (4x + 50) degrees.  Another angle formed by the intersection is labeled as 3x degrees.  An angle outside the circle, formed by one of the chords and a tangent line, is labeled as 30 degrees.  The problem asks to find the value of x.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem.**
    * The problem involves angles formed by chords and tangents.  The relevant theorem is the **Intersecting Chords and Tangents Theorem**, which states that the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.  Also, the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc.

* **Step 2: Apply the theorem to the given information.**
    * The angle (4x + 50) degrees is formed by the intersection of two chords.  The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are cut off by the two chords.  Let's call the measure of the smaller intercepted arc ""a"" and the measure of the larger intercepted arc ""b"".  According to the theorem, (4x + 50) = (1/2)(a + b).
    * The angle 3x degrees is also formed by the intersection of two chords.  The intercepted arcs are the same as in the previous step.  Therefore, 3x = (1/2)(a + b).
    * The angle 30 degrees is formed by a tangent and a chord.  The intercepted arc is the arc cut off by the chord.  Let's call the measure of this arc ""c"".  According to the theorem, 30 = (1/2)c.

* **Step 3: Solve for x.**
    * From the previous step, we have two equations: (4x + 50) = (1/2)(a + b) and 3x = (1/2)(a + b).  Since the right-hand sides of these equations are equal, we can set the left-hand sides equal to each other: 4x + 50 = 3x.

Find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of an isosceles right triangle with uniform areal density, where the base of the triangle is along the x-axis and the two equal sides have length 'a'.

**2. Solution:**

* **Divide the triangle into infinitesimally thin horizontal strips:** Imagine slicing the triangle into thin horizontal strips, each with a width 'dy' and a length 'x'. 
* **Determine the mass of each strip:** The mass of each strip is proportional to its area. The area of each strip is approximately 'x * dy'. Since the areal density is uniform, the mass of each strip is 'dm = ρ * x * dy', where ρ is the areal density.
* **Find the y-coordinate of the center of mass of each strip:** The center of mass of each strip is located at its midpoint, which has a y-coordinate of 'y'.
* **Integrate to find the total mass and the y-coordinate of the center of mass:** To find the total mass (M) and the y-coordinate of the center of mass (y_cm), we need to integrate over the entire triangle:

    * **Total mass (M):**  M = ∫dm = ∫ρ * x * dy. The limits of integration are from y = 0 to y = a/√2 (the height of the triangle).
    * **y-coordinate of the center of mass (y_cm):** y_cm = (1/M) * ∫y * dm = (1/M) * ∫y * ρ * x * dy. The limits of integration are the same as before.

* **Relate x and y using the geometry of the triangle:**  The triangle is isosceles and right-angled. Using similar triangles, we can relate x and y: x/y = a/(a/√2) = √2. Therefore, x = √2 * y.

* **Substitute x in the integrals:** Substitute x = √2 * y in the integrals for M and y_cm.

* **Solve the integrals:**
    * **M:** M = ∫ρ * √2 * y * dy = ρ * √2 * (y^2/2) | from 0 to a/√2 = (ρ * a^2)/2

The problem asks for the equivalent resistance between terminals 'a' and 'b' in an infinitely long chain of resistors, where each resistor has a resistance of R = 1 ohm.

**2. Solution:**

1. **Symmetry:** The circuit exhibits symmetry. If we remove the first section of the chain (containing three resistors), the remaining circuit is identical to the original one.

2. **Equivalent Resistance:** Let the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain be 'Req'.  Since the circuit is symmetrical, the resistance between 'a' and the point where the first section is removed is also 'Req'.

3. **Analyzing the First Section:** The first section of the chain consists of three resistors in parallel (R, R, and R) followed by a resistor in series (R).

4. **Parallel Resistance:** The equivalent resistance of three resistors in parallel is given by:
   1/R_parallel = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
   Therefore, R_parallel = R/3

5. **Series Resistance:** The equivalent resistance of the first section is then:
   R_section = R_parallel + R = R/3 + R = 4R/3

6. **Recursive Relationship:** The equivalent resistance 'Req' can be expressed as the sum of the resistance of the first section (4R/3) and the equivalent resistance of the remaining infinite chain (Req):
   Req = 4R/3 + Req

7. **Solving for Req:** Solving the equation for Req, we get:
   Req - Req = 4R/3
   0 = 4R/3
   This equation has no solution, which means our assumption that the equivalent resistance is finite is incorrect.

8. **Infinite Resistance:** The equivalent resistance of an infinitely long chain of resistors is infinite. This is because the current has an infinite number of paths to flow through, and the resistance of each path is non-zero.

* **Equal Arcs:** Since angles DCE and DEC intercept the same arc (DE and DC, respectively), the arcs must be equal in measure.
* **Setting up the Equation:**  Therefore, the measures of the intercepted arcs are equal: 2(5x - 12) = 2(3x).
* **Solving for x:**
    * Simplify the equation: 10x - 24 = 6x
    * Subtract 6x from both sides: 4x - 24 = 0
    * Add 24 to both sides: 4x = 24
    * Divide both sides by 4: x = 6

In the given triangle ABC, F is the intersection point of angle bisector CD and BE. CG is perpendicular to AB at point G. If ∠ACG = 32°, find the measure of ∠BFC.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1:**  Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we have ∠CGB = 90°.
* **Step 2:**  In triangle ACG, we know ∠ACG = 32° and ∠CGB = 90°.  Therefore, ∠CAG = 180° - ∠ACG - ∠CGB = 180° - 32° - 90° = 58°.
* **Step 3:**  CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, so ∠ACD = ∠BCD.  Since ∠CAG = 58°, we have ∠ACD = ∠BCD = (180° - ∠CAG) / 2 = (180° - 58°) / 2 = 61°.

955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"## Problem Statement:

The image shows a regular pentagon ABCDE inscribed in a circle with center O.  The problem asks for the measure of angle ADE.

## Solution:

1. **Understanding the Properties of Regular Polygons:** A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal.  The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2) * 180 degrees.

2. **Calculating the Interior Angle of a Regular Pentagon:**  A pentagon has 5 sides (n=5).  Therefore, the sum of its interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.  Each interior angle of a regular pentagon measures 540/5 = 108 degrees.

3. **Identifying the Central Angle:**  Angle AOE is a central angle of the pentagon, subtended by side AE.  Since the pentagon is regular, central angle AOE is 1/5 of the total angle around point O, which is 360 degrees.  Therefore, angle AOE = 360/5 = 72 degrees.

4. **Applying Triangle Properties:** Triangle ADE is isosceles because AD = AE (sides of the regular pentagon).  Therefore, angles AED and DAE are equal.

5. **Using the Angle Sum Property of Triangles:** The sum of the angles in triangle ADE is 180 degrees.  Therefore, angle ADE + angle AED + angle DAE = 180 degrees.  Since angle AED = angle DAE, we can write: angle ADE + 2 * angle AED = 180 degrees.

6. **Finding Angle AED:**  Angle AED is an exterior angle of triangle AOE.  The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.  Therefore, angle AED = angle AOE + angle OAE = 72 degrees + 108 degrees = 180 degrees.

7. **Calculating Angle ADE:**  Substituting the value of angle AED in the equation from step 5, we get: angle ADE + 2 * 180 degrees = 180 degrees.  Solving for angle ADE, we get: angle ADE = 180 degrees - 360 degrees = -180 degrees.

8. **Adjusting for Angle Measure:**  Since angles are typically measured between 0 and 360 degrees, we add 360 degrees to the negative angle: -180 degrees + 360 degrees = 180 degrees.

Two line segments meet at a point on line l, forming three angles: x degrees, y degrees, and 70 degrees. We are given that y is equal to the square of x. The problem asks us to find the value of y.

**2. Solution:**

* **Step 1: Identify the relationship between the angles.**
   The angles x, y, and 70 degrees form a straight angle, which means they add up to 180 degrees. 
   Therefore, we have the equation: x + y + 70 = 180

* **Step 2: Substitute the given information.**
   We are given that y = x². Substituting this into the equation from Step 1, we get:
   x + x² + 70 = 180

* **Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation.**
   Rearranging the equation, we get:
   x² + x - 110 = 0
   Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:
   (x + 11)(x - 10) = 0
   This gives us two possible solutions for x: x = -11 or x = 10.

* **Step 4: Determine the valid solution.**
   Since angles cannot be negative, we discard the solution x = -11. Therefore, x = 10.

* **Step 5: Calculate the value of y.**
   We know that y = x². Substituting x = 10, we get:
   y = 10² = 100
