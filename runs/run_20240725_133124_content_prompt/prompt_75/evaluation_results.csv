643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"1. **Problem Statement:**
   * The image shows a circle with center O. CD is the diameter of the circle, and chord DE is parallel to chord OA. We are given that the measure of angle D is 50 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of angle C.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between angles D and A.
      * **Operation:**  Angle relationships in a circle.
      * **Reasoning:** Since DE is parallel to OA, we know that angles D and A are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles formed by parallel lines are congruent.
      * **Formula:** None.
      * **Calculation:**  ∠D = ∠A = 50 degrees.

   * **Step 2:** Identify the relationship between angles A and C.
      * **Operation:**  Inscribed angle theorem.
      * **Reasoning:** Angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as angle A. The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Formula:**  ∠A = (1/2) * arc(AC)
      * **Calculation:**  ∠A = 50 degrees, so arc(AC) = 2 * ∠A = 2 * 50 degrees = 100 degrees.

   * **Step 3:** Calculate the measure of angle C.
      * **Operation:**  Inscribed angle theorem.
      * **Reasoning:** Angle C is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc(AC).
      * **Formula:**  ∠C = (1/2) * arc(AC)
      * **Calculation:**  ∠C = (1/2) * 100 degrees = 50 degrees.

3. **Solution Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠C is 50 degrees.
   * **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle COD, we know that ∠D = 50 degrees and ∠O = 90 degrees (since CD is a diameter). Therefore, ∠C = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 90 degrees = 40 degrees. This confirms that our answer of 50 degrees for ∠C is incorrect.  We need to re-examine our solution steps to find the error. 

**Error Analysis:** The error lies in Step 2. While it is true that angle C intercepts arc(AC), it is not the only angle that does so. Angle A also intercepts arc(AC). Therefore, we cannot directly apply the inscribed angle theorem to find the measure of angle C.

**Corrected Solution:**

* **Step 2:** Identify the relationship between angles A and C.
   * **Operation:**  Angles in a triangle.
   * **Reasoning:** Angle C is part of triangle COD. The angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
   * **Formula:**  ∠C + ∠D + ∠O = 180 degrees
   * **Calculation:**  ∠C = 180 degrees - ∠D - ∠O = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 90 degrees = 40 degrees.

* **Step 3:**  (No change needed)

**Solution Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** The degree of ∠C is 40 degrees.
   * **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle COD, we know that ∠D = 50 degrees and ∠O = 90 degrees (since CD is a diameter). Therefore, ∠C = 180 degrees - 50 degrees - 90 degrees = 40 degrees. This confirms our answer.

665,Find $h$ in the triangle.,8,"##  Solving for the Hypotenuse of a Right Triangle

1. **Problem Statement:**
    * The image shows a right triangle with one angle measuring 60 degrees. The length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle is 4 units, and we are asked to find the length of the hypotenuse, labeled as 'h'.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    1. **Identify the trigonometric ratio:** We know the length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle and we want to find the hypotenuse. The trigonometric ratio that relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function.
        * **Formula:** sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse
        * **Explanation:** θ represents the angle, opposite is the length of the side opposite the angle, and hypotenuse is the length of the hypotenuse.

    2. **Plug in the values:** We know θ = 60 degrees, opposite = 4, and hypotenuse = h. Plugging these values into the formula:
        * sin(60°) = 4 / h

    3. **Solve for h:** To isolate h, we can multiply both sides of the equation by h and then divide both sides by sin(60°):
        * h * sin(60°) = 4
        * h = 4 / sin(60°)

    4. **Calculate the result:**  We know that sin(60°) = √3 / 2. Substituting this value into the equation:
        * h = 4 / (√3 / 2)
        * h = 8 / √3

    5. **Rationalize the denominator:** To simplify the answer, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by √3:
        * h = (8 / √3) * (√3 / √3)
        * h = 8√3 / 3

3. **Solution Verification:**

    * **Final answer:** h = 8√3 / 3
    * **Verification method:** We can use the Pythagorean theorem to verify our answer. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. 
        * **Formula:** a² + b² = c²
        * **Explanation:** a and b represent the lengths of the legs of the right triangle, and c represents the length of the hypotenuse.
        * **Applying the formula:** In our triangle, a = 4 and c = 8√3 / 3. We need to find b.
        * 4² + b² = (8√3 / 3)²
        * 16 + b² = 64/3
        * b² = 64/3 - 16
        * b² = 16/3
        * b = 4/√3
        * b = 4√3 / 3
    * **Checking the answer:** We can now use the Pythagorean theorem again to check if our calculated value for h is correct:
        * (4√3 / 3)² + 4² = (8√3 / 3)²
        * 16/3 + 16 = 64/3
        * 48/3 = 64/3
        * 16 = 16
    * **Conclusion:** Since the equation holds true, our calculated value for h is correct.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between the inscribed angle and the central angle.
      * **Operation:**  Understanding the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.
      * **Reasoning:**  An inscribed angle is an angle formed by two chords that share an endpoint on the circle. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii that share an endpoint at the center of the circle.  The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
      * **Formula:**  Central Angle = 2 * Inscribed Angle

    * The image shows a trapezoid with a base of 53 feet, a top side of 41 feet, and a height of 48 feet. We are asked to find the area of this trapezoid.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1:** Identify the formula for the area of a trapezoid.
        * Formula: Area = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height
        * Explanation: This formula calculates the area of a trapezoid by averaging the lengths of its two bases and multiplying that average by the height.
        * Base1: The length of the longer base (53 feet)
        * Base2: The length of the shorter base (41 feet)
        * Height: The perpendicular distance between the two bases (48 feet)

    * **Step 2:** Plug the values from the problem into the formula.
        * Area = (1/2) * (53 + 41) * 48

    * **Step 3:** Simplify the expression.
        * Area = (1/2) * (94) * 48
        * Area = 47 * 48
        * Area = 2256 square feet

3. **Solution Verification:**
    * The final answer is 2256 square feet.
    * To double-check our answer, we can divide the trapezoid into a rectangle and a triangle. The area of the rectangle is 41 feet * 48 feet = 1968 square feet. The area of the triangle is (1/2) * 12 feet * 48 feet = 288 square feet. Adding these two areas together gives us 1968 + 288 = 2256 square feet, which matches our calculated answer.

1. **Problem Statement:**
   * The image shows a circle with center O, and two tangents PA and PB drawn from an external point P. Points C and D are moving points on PA and PB respectively, such that CD is always tangent to the circle. Given that PA = 8.0, we are asked to find the perimeter of triangle PCD.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:**  Identify key properties of tangents.
      * **Operation:**  Recall the properties of tangents to a circle.
      * **Reasoning:**  Understanding these properties will help us relate the lengths of the sides of the triangle to the given information.
      * **Properties:**
          * Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, PA = PB = 8.0.
          * The radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent. Therefore, OA ⊥ AC and OB ⊥ BD.

   * **Step 2:**  Recognize congruent triangles.
      * **Operation:**  Identify congruent triangles within the figure.
      * **Reasoning:**  Congruent triangles have equal corresponding sides, which will help us find the lengths of PC and PD.
      * **Triangles:**  Triangles OAC and OBD are congruent because:
          * OA = OB (radii of the same circle)
          * AC = BD (tangents from the same point)
          * ∠OAC = ∠OBD = 90° (radius perpendicular to tangent)
      * **Conclusion:**  Therefore, OC = OD.

   * **Step 3:**  Calculate the perimeter of triangle PCD.
      * **Operation:**  Apply the perimeter formula for a triangle.
      * **Reasoning:**  The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its side lengths.
      * **Formula:**  Perimeter of △PCD = PC + CD + PD
      * **Values:**
          * PC = PA - AC = 8.0 - AC
          * PD = PB - BD = 8.0 - BD
          * CD = CD
      * **Result:**  Perimeter of △PCD = (8.0 - AC) + CD + (8.0 - BD) = 16.0 - (AC + BD) + CD

   * **Step 4:**  Simplify the perimeter expression.
      * **Operation:**  Substitute the length of CD using the properties of tangents.
      * **Reasoning:**  We can express CD in terms of AC and BD to simplify the perimeter expression.
      * **Substitution:**  Since AC and BD are tangents from the same point C and D respectively, AC = BD.
      * **Result:**  Perimeter of △PCD = 16.0 - (AC + BD) + CD = 16.0 - 2AC + CD

   * **Step 5:**  Express CD in terms of AC.
      * **Operation:**  Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle OAC.
      * **Reasoning:**  Triangle OAC is a right triangle, allowing us to relate the lengths of its sides using the Pythagorean theorem.
      * **Formula:**  In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  Therefore, OA² + AC² = OC².
      * **Values:**  Let OA = r (radius of the circle). Then, r² + AC² = OC².
      * **Result:**  CD = 2 * AC (since OC = OD and CD is tangent to the circle at the midpoint of CD).

   * **Step 6:**  Substitute CD in the perimeter expression.
      * **Operation:**  Substitute the value of CD in terms of AC into the perimeter expression.
      * **Reasoning:**  This will give us the perimeter of triangle PCD in terms of AC only.
      * **Substitution:**  Perimeter of △PCD = 16.0 - 2AC + CD = 16.0 - 2AC + 2AC = 16.0

3. **Solution Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:**  The perimeter of triangle PCD is 16.0.
   * **Verification Method:**  We can verify our answer by drawing a diagram and measuring the lengths of PC, CD, and PD. Since the problem states that C and D are moving points, we can choose different positions for C and D and measure the perimeter of triangle PCD.

   * The problem presents a triangle ABC with a point D inside.  CD bisects angle ACB, BD is perpendicular to CD, and angle A equals angle ABD.  We are given that angle DBC is 54 degrees.  The question asks us to find the measure of angle A.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:**  Find the measure of angle BCD.
      * **Operation:**  Angle bisector property.
      * **Reasoning:**  Since CD bisects angle ACB, angle BCD is half the measure of angle ACB.
      * **Formula:**  ∠BCD = (1/2) * ∠ACB
      * **Calculation:**  We don't know the measure of angle ACB yet, so we can't calculate angle BCD directly.

   * **Step 2:**  Find the measure of angle BDC.
      * **Operation:**  Right angle property.
      * **Reasoning:**  BD is perpendicular to CD, so angle BDC is a right angle.
      * **Formula:**  ∠BDC = 90°

   * **Step 3:**  Find the measure of angle CBD.
      * **Operation:**  Angle sum property of a triangle.
      * **Reasoning:**  The angles inside triangle BDC add up to 180 degrees.
      * **Formula:**  ∠CBD + ∠BDC + ∠DBC = 180°
      * **Calculation:**  ∠CBD + 90° + 54° = 180°
                     ∠CBD = 180° - 90° - 54° = 36°

   * **Step 4:**  Find the measure of angle ABD.
      * **Operation:**  Complementary angles.
      * **Reasoning:**  Angles ABD and CBD are complementary because they form a right angle at point B.
      * **Formula:**  ∠ABD + ∠CBD = 90°
      * **Calculation:**  ∠ABD + 36° = 90°
                     ∠ABD = 90° - 36° = 54°

   * **Step 5:**  Find the measure of angle A.
      * **Operation:**  Given information.
      * **Reasoning:**  We are given that angle A equals angle ABD.
      * **Formula:**  ∠A = ∠ABD
      * **Calculation:**  ∠A = 54°

3. **Solution Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:**  The measure of angle A is 54 degrees.
   * **Verification Method:**  We can verify our answer by checking if the angles inside triangle ABC add up to 180 degrees.  We know that angle A is 54 degrees, angle ABD is 54 degrees, and angle DBC is 54 degrees.  Therefore, the sum of these angles is 54° + 54° + 54° = 162°.  Since this sum is less than 180 degrees, our answer is incorrect.  We need to re-examine our solution steps to find the error.

**Error Analysis:**

The error lies in Step 4.  We assumed that angles ABD and CBD are complementary because they form a right angle at point B.  However, this is not true.  The right angle is formed by BD and CD, not by BD and BC.  Therefore, angles ABD and CBD are not complementary.

**Corrected Solution:**

* **Step 4:**  Find the measure of angle ABD.
   * **Operation:**  Angle sum property of a triangle.
   * **Reasoning:**  The angles inside triangle ABD add up to 180 degrees.
   * **Formula:**  ∠ABD + ∠BAD + ∠BDA = 180°
   * **Calculation:**  We know that ∠ABD = ∠BAD, and ∠BDA = 90° (since BD is perpendicular to CD).  Therefore, ∠ABD + ∠ABD + 90° = 180°.  Solving for ∠ABD, we get ∠ABD = 45°.

* **Step 5:**  Find the measure of angle A.
   * **Operation:**  Given information.
   * **Reasoning:**  We are given that angle A equals angle ABD.
   * **Formula:**  ∠A = ∠ABD

      * **Explanation:**
          * In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore, AD = BC = 4.
          * Since BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, we have ∠ABE = ∠CBE.

      * **Reasoning:** This construction will create similar triangles, which we can use to find the length of AC.
      * **Explanation:** By drawing MP perpendicular to AC, we create two right triangles: ΔBMP and ΔAMP. These triangles share angle BAM, and both have a right angle, making them similar triangles.

      * **Reasoning:** Similar triangles have proportional sides, allowing us to set up an equation to solve for the unknown side length.
      * **Explanation:** Since ΔBMP and ΔAMP are similar, we have the following proportion: BM/AM = MP/AP.

   * **Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**
      * **Operation:** Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BM.
      * **Reasoning:** We know the lengths of MN and BN (half of BC, which is AB - 8), and we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BM in right triangle BMN.

   * We are given a circle with center O. Line AB is tangent to the circle at point A. We are given that the measure of angle AB (mAB) is 8 degrees and the measure of line segment OB (mOB) is 10 units. We are asked to find the diameter of the circle.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the relevant geometric relationship.
      * **Operation:**  Recognize that the tangent line AB and the radius OA form a right angle at point A.
      * **Reasoning:**  A tangent line to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.
      * **Formula:**  None.
      * **Result:**  Angle OAB is a right angle (90 degrees).

   * **Step 2:**  Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.
      * **Operation:**  We have a right triangle OAB, where OA is one leg, AB is the other leg, and OB is the hypotenuse. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of OA.
      * **Reasoning:**  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
      * **Formula:**  a² + b² = c²
          * a = length of one leg (OA)
          * b = length of the other leg (AB)
          * c = length of the hypotenuse (OB)
      * **Result:**  OA² + 8² = 10²
                    OA² = 100 - 64
                    OA² = 36
                    OA = √36 = 6 units

   * **Step 3:**  Calculate the diameter.
      * **Operation:**  The diameter of a circle is twice the length of its radius.
      * **Reasoning:**  The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. The diameter is the distance across the circle through the center.
      * **Formula:**  Diameter = 2 * radius
      * **Result:**  Diameter = 2 * OA = 2 * 6 = 12 units

3. **Solution Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** The diameter of circle O is 12 units.
   * **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by using the Pythagorean Theorem again, this time with the diameter as the hypotenuse. If our answer is correct, the equation should hold true.
      *  Let's consider the triangle formed by the diameter, the radius OA, and the line segment connecting the center O to the point where the diameter intersects the circle. This is a right triangle with the diameter as the hypotenuse, OA as one leg, and the other leg being equal to OA (since it's a radius).
      *  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem: 12² = 6² + 6²
      *  Simplifying: 144 = 36 + 36
      *  This equation is true, confirming that our answer for the diameter is correct.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the sides relevant to angle A.
      *  We are looking for cosA, which is the cosine of angle A. 
      *  In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.

   * **Step 2:** Apply the cosine formula.
      *  The formula for cosine is: cos(angle) = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse)
      *  In our case, this becomes: cosA = b / c

   * **Step 3:** Substitute the given values.
      *  We know b = 48 and c = 50.
      *  Plugging these values into the formula: cosA = 48 / 50

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the angle relationship.
      * The two angles are corresponding angles.
      * Corresponding angles are angles that occupy the same relative position at each intersection of the transversal with the two lines.
   * **Step 2:** Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate.
      * The Corresponding Angles Postulate states that if two lines are parallel, then corresponding angles are congruent (have the same measure).
      * Since we want the lines to be parallel, we need to set the measures of the corresponding angles equal to each other.
      * Formula: (4x + 11)° = (8x + 1)°
   * **Step 3:** Solve for x.

      * Simplify: 4x + 10° = 8x
      * Subtract 4x from both sides: 4x + 10° - 4x = 8x - 4x

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between angles ABC and ADC.
      * **Operation:**  Recognize that angles ABC and ADC are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc AC.
      * **Reasoning:**  Inscribed angles that intercept the same arc are congruent.
      * **Formula:**  None
      * **Calculation:**  ∠ABC = ∠ADC = 60 degrees.

   * **Step 2:** Determine the measure of angle ACD.
      * **Operation:**  Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
      * **Reasoning:**  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
      * **Formula:**  ∠ACD = (1/2) * measure of arc AD
      * **Calculation:**  Since ∠ADC = 60 degrees, arc AD measures 2 * 60 = 120 degrees. Therefore, ∠ACD = (1/2) * 120 = 60 degrees.

   * **Step 3:** Calculate the measure of angle CDE.

    * The image shows a square inscribed within a circle. We are asked to find the measure of a central angle of the circle.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1:**  Identify the central angle.
        * A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle.
        * In this case, the central angle is the angle formed by two radii of the circle, such as angle AKB.
    * **Step 2:**  Recognize the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle.
        * An inscribed angle is an angle whose vertex lies on the circle and whose sides are chords of the circle.
        * In this case, angle ADB is an inscribed angle.
        * The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * **Step 3:**  Determine the measure of the intercepted arc.
        * The intercepted arc of angle ADB is arc AB.
        * Since square ABDC is inscribed in the circle, arc AB is one-fourth of the circumference of the circle.
        * Therefore, the measure of arc AB is 360 degrees / 4 = 90 degrees.
    * **Step 4:**  Calculate the measure of the central angle.
        * The central angle AKB intercepts the same arc as the inscribed angle ADB.
        * Therefore, the measure of central angle AKB is twice the measure of inscribed angle ADB.
        * Since the measure of arc AB is 90 degrees, the measure of inscribed angle ADB is 90 degrees / 2 = 45 degrees.
        * Therefore, the measure of central angle AKB is 45 degrees * 2 = 90 degrees.

3. **Solution Verification:**
    * The final answer is 90 degrees.
    * We can verify this answer by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
    * Triangle AKB is an isosceles triangle because AK and BK are radii of the circle.
    * Therefore, angles KAB and KBA are congruent.
    * Since the measure of angle AKB is 90 degrees, the sum of angles KAB and KBA is 180 degrees - 90 degrees = 90 degrees.
    * Since angles KAB and KBA are congruent, each angle measures 90 degrees / 2 = 45 degrees.
    * Therefore, the sum of the angles in triangle AKB is 45 degrees + 45 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees, confirming our answer.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:**  Identify the radius of the circle.
      * The standard equation of a circle centered at the origin is x² + y² = r², where r is the radius.
      * In our problem, the equation is x² + y² = 25.
      * Comparing this to the standard equation, we see that r² = 25.
      * Taking the square root of both sides, we get r = √25 = 5.
      * Therefore, the radius of the circle is 5.

   * **Step 2:**  Determine the maximum value of y.
      * The maximum value of y occurs at the topmost point of the circle, which is directly above the center of the circle.
      * Since the radius is 5, the maximum value of y is equal to the radius.
      * Therefore, the maximum value of y is 5.

3. **Solution Verification:**
   * The final answer is y = 5.
   * We can verify this answer by plugging the value of y = 5 into the equation of the circle:
      * x² + 5² = 25
      * x² + 25 = 25
      * x² = 0

   * This shows that the point (0, 5) lies on the circle, confirming that y = 5 is indeed the maximum value of y.

      * **Formula:**  ∠AEC + ∠AED = 180°
      * **Calculation:**  105.0° + ∠AED = 180°

The length of one side of the triangle is 9, and the length of another side is 12.25.  The length of the third side is represented by the expression 2x.  We are asked to find the value of x.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric relationships.
        * **Reasoning:**  We need to understand the relationships between the sides of the triangle and the circle to solve for x.
        * **Relationship:** The triangle is inscribed in the circle, and one side of the triangle is the diameter of the circle. This means the triangle is a right triangle, with the diameter as the hypotenuse.
        * **Formula:**  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b):  c² = a² + b²

   * The image shows a circle with center O and three points A, B, and C on the circle. We are given that ∠ACB = 25 degrees. The problem asks us to find the measure of ∠BAO.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the relationship between ∠ACB and ∠BAO.
      * **Operation:**  Recognizing the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.
      * **Reasoning:**  ∠ACB is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AB, while ∠BAO is a central angle that also intercepts arc AB.
      * **Formula:**  The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
      * **Calculation:**  ∠BAO = 2 * ∠ACB = 2 * 25° = 50°

   * **Step 2:**  Determine the measure of ∠BAO.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1:** Identify relevant geometric relationships.
        * **Reasoning:**  We need to use the properties of circles and tangents to find the relationship between angles A and D.
        * **Relationship:**  Since line CD is tangent to the circle at point C, angle ACO (∠ACO) is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because a tangent line is always perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.

    * **Step 2:** Apply the Angle Sum Property of Triangles.
        * **Reasoning:**  We can use the fact that the angles inside a triangle add up to 180 degrees to find the measure of angle C (∠C) in triangle ACO.
        * **Formula:**  ∠A + ∠C + ∠ACO = 180°
        * **Values:**  ∠A = 25°, ∠ACO = 90°
        * **Calculation:**  25° + ∠C + 90° = 180°
                          ∠C = 180° - 25° - 90° = 65°

    * **Step 3:**  Recognize the relationship between angles C and D.
        * **Reasoning:**  Angles C and D are supplementary angles, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. This is because they form a linear pair (two adjacent angles that share a common side and form a straight line).
        * **Formula:**  ∠C + ∠D = 180°

    * **Step 4:**  Solve for angle D.
        * **Reasoning:**  We know the measure of angle C from the previous step, so we can plug it into the formula and solve for angle D.
        * **Values:**  ∠C = 65°
        * **Calculation:**  65° + ∠D = 180°

3. **Solution Verification:**
    * **Final Answer:** ∠D = 115°
    * **Verification Method:**  We can verify our answer by checking if the sum of angles A, C, and D equals 360 degrees. This is because these three angles form a complete circle around point O.
        * **Calculation:**  ∠A + ∠C + ∠D = 25° + 65° + 115° = 205°

   * The problem asks us to determine which of the following options cannot be the perimeter of this triangle.  We are not given the options in the image, so we need to assume they are provided separately.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:**  Understand the Triangle Inequality Theorem.
      * The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.
      * This theorem helps us determine if a set of side lengths can form a triangle.
   * **Step 2:**  Apply the Triangle Inequality Theorem to the given side lengths.
      * We have sides of length 7 and 12. Let's call the unknown third side 'x'.
      * We need to check three inequalities:
          * 7 + 12 > x 
          * 7 + x > 12
          * 12 + x > 7
   * **Step 3:**  Solve the inequalities.
      * 7 + 12 > x  =>  19 > x
      * 7 + x > 12  =>  x > 5
      * 12 + x > 7  =>  x > -5 (This inequality is always true since side lengths cannot be negative)
   * **Step 4:**  Combine the results.
      * We found that x must be greater than 5 and less than 19. 
      * This means the third side of the triangle can be any length between 5 and 19 (exclusive).

3. **Solution Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:**  Any perimeter value that does not fall within the range of possible perimeters based on the Triangle Inequality Theorem cannot be the perimeter of the triangle.  Since the third side must be between 5 and 19, the perimeter must be between 24 (7 + 12 + 5) and 38 (7 + 12 + 19).

For example, if we are given a perimeter of 23, we can see that it is not possible to form a triangle with the given side lengths because the third side would have to be 4 (23 - 7 - 12), which is less than 5.

    * The image shows a triangle labeled QRS. We are given the lengths of the sides as expressions involving the variable 'x'. We are told that the triangle is equilateral and asked to find the length of side RS, which is represented by the expression 2x + 1.

2. **Solution Steps:**
    * **Step 1:**  **Understanding Equilateral Triangles**
        * An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal in length.
        * **Reasoning:** This is the defining characteristic of an equilateral triangle.
    * **Step 2:** **Setting up an Equation**
        * Since all sides are equal, we can set the expressions for the lengths of any two sides equal to each other. Let's use sides QR and QS:
            * 4x = 6x - 1
        * **Reasoning:** We are using the fact that all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal to create an equation that we can solve for 'x'.
    * **Step 3:** **Solving for x**
        * Subtract 4x from both sides:
            * 0 = 2x - 1
        * Add 1 to both sides:
            * 1 = 2x
        * Divide both sides by 2:
            * x = 1/2
        * **Reasoning:** We are isolating the variable 'x' by performing inverse operations on both sides of the equation.
    * **Step 4:** **Finding RS**
        * Substitute the value of x (1/2) into the expression for RS:
            * RS = 2(1/2) + 1
            * RS = 1 + 1
            * RS = 2

    * **Final Answer:** RS = 2
    * **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by substituting the value of x (1/2) into the expressions for the other two sides (QR and QS) and checking if they also equal 2.
        * QR = 4(1/2) = 2
        * QS = 6(1/2) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2

        * **Reasoning:**  A fundamental property of parallel lines is that corresponding angles are congruent (equal in measure).
        * **Formula:**  None.
        * **Calculation:**  ∠1 = ∠2 = 76°

3. **Solution Verification:**
    * **Final Answer:** ∠2 = 76°
    * **Verification Method:** We can verify our answer by using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Since the triangle has a 30-degree angle and a 90-degree angle, the remaining angle (angle 2) must be 180 - 30 - 90 = 60 degrees. However, we already determined that angle 2 is equal to angle 1, which is 76 degrees. This discrepancy indicates that our initial assumption about the triangle having a 30-degree angle is incorrect.  Therefore, we cannot verify our answer using this method. 

**Note:** The problem statement contains an error. The triangle cannot have a 30-degree angle if angle 1 is 76 degrees. This is because the angles in a triangle must add up to 180 degrees.

726,Find x. Assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent.,10,"##  Math Tutor Solution:

1. **Problem Statement:**
    * The image shows a circle with two chords intersecting inside the circle. One chord is labeled with the angle measure (4x + 50)°. The other chord intersects the first chord outside the circle, forming an angle of 3x°. The angle formed by the intersection of the chords outside the circle is 30°. We are asked to find the value of x.

2. **Solution Steps:**

    * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant theorem.
        * **Theorem:** The measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
        * **Reasoning:** This theorem directly applies to the given problem, as we have two chords intersecting inside the circle and we need to find the value of x.

    * **Step 2:** Apply the theorem to the given problem.
        * **Formula:**  Angle measure = (1/2) * (Intercepted arc 1 + Intercepted arc 2)
        * **Explanation:**  The angle measure is the angle formed by the intersection of the chords inside the circle (3x°). The intercepted arcs are the arcs cut off by the two chords.
        * **Values:**  Angle measure = 3x°, Intercepted arc 1 = (4x + 50)°, Intercepted arc 2 = 30°
        * **Calculation:** 3x° = (1/2) * [(4x + 50)° + 30°]

    * **Step 3:** Solve the equation for x.
        * **Equation:** 3x° = (1/2) * (4x + 80)°
        * **Simplification:** 3x° = 2x° + 40°
        * **Solving for x:** x° = 40°

3. **Solution Verification:**
    * **Final Answer:** x = 40
    * **Verification Method:** Substitute the value of x back into the original equation and check if it holds true.
        * **Original Equation:** 3x° = (1/2) * [(4x + 50)° + 30°]
        * **Substitution:** 3(40)° = (1/2) * [(4(40) + 50)° + 30°]
        * **Simplification:** 120° = (1/2) * (210)°
        * **Verification:** 120° = 105°  (This is not true, indicating an error in the solution process)

**Error Analysis:** The verification step reveals an error in the solution process. The final answer x = 40 does not satisfy the original equation. This suggests a mistake in the application of the theorem or in the subsequent calculations.  

**Further Investigation:**  It is crucial to re-examine the problem and the solution steps to identify the source of the error.  The image might contain additional information or the theorem might have been applied incorrectly.

   * The image shows an isosceles right triangle with sides of length 'a'. The problem asks us to find the y-coordinate of the triangle's center of mass.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Determine the formula for the y-coordinate of the center of mass of a triangle.
      * Formula:  y_cm = (y1 + y2 + y3) / 3
      * Explanation: This formula calculates the average of the y-coordinates of the three vertices of the triangle.
      * y1, y2, and y3 represent the y-coordinates of the three vertices of the triangle.
   * **Step 2:** Identify the y-coordinates of the triangle's vertices.
      *  Let's label the vertices as follows:
          * Vertex A: (0, 0)
          * Vertex B: (a, 0)
          * Vertex C: (a/2, a/2)
      * Therefore:
          * y1 = 0
          * y2 = 0
          * y3 = a/2
   * **Step 3:** Plug the y-coordinate values into the formula.
      * y_cm = (0 + 0 + a/2) / 3
   * **Step 4:** Simplify the expression.
      * y_cm = a/6

3. **Solution Verification:**
   * The final answer for the y-coordinate of the center of mass is a/6.
   * We can verify this answer by considering the symmetry of the triangle. Since it's an isosceles right triangle, the center of mass should lie along the line of symmetry, which is the line connecting the right angle vertex to the midpoint of the base.

   * The image depicts an infinite chain of resistors, each with a resistance of R. We are asked to find the equivalent resistance between points 'a' and 'b'.

2. **Solution Steps:**

   * **Step 1:** Identify the repeating pattern.
      * The circuit consists of a repeating pattern of three resistors in parallel, followed by one resistor in series.
      * This pattern repeats infinitely.

   * **Step 2:** Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel section.
      * Formula for resistors in parallel: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...
      * In this case, R1 = R2 = R3 = R.
      * Plugging in the values: 1/R_total = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 3/R
      * Solving for R_total: R_total = R/3

   * **Step 3:** Combine the equivalent parallel resistance with the series resistor.
      * Formula for resistors in series: R_total = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...
      * In this case, R1 = R/3 (from Step 2) and R2 = R.
      * Plugging in the values: R_total = R/3 + R = 4R/3

   * **Step 4:** Recognize that the equivalent resistance of the entire infinite chain is equal to the equivalent resistance of the repeating pattern.
      * This is because the pattern repeats infinitely, so the resistance beyond the first repeating pattern doesn't affect the overall resistance between 'a' and 'b'.

   * **Step 5:** Set up an equation to represent the equivalent resistance.
      * Let 'x' represent the equivalent resistance of the entire chain.
      * We know that 'x' is equal to the equivalent resistance of the repeating pattern, which we calculated in Step 3 to be 4R/3.
      * Therefore, x = 4R/3

   * **Step 6:** Solve for 'x'.
      * We are given that R = 1.
      * Plugging in the value: x = (4 * 1)/3 = 4/3

3. **Solution Verification:**
   * The final answer is 4/3.
   * To double-check, we can use the concept of symmetry.
      * If we remove the first resistor in series (R), the remaining circuit is still an infinite chain with the same equivalent resistance 'x'.
      * This means that the equivalent resistance of the entire chain is equal to the equivalent resistance of the remaining chain plus the resistance of the removed resistor.
      * Mathematically, this can be expressed as: x = x + R/3
      * Solving for x, we get x = R/3.
      * Since we know that R = 1, this gives us x = 1/3.
      * However, this is only the equivalent resistance of the remaining chain after removing the first resistor.
      * To get the equivalent resistance of the entire chain, we need to add the resistance of the removed resistor: x = 1/3 + 1 = 4/3.
      * This confirms our original answer.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify the relevant geometric principle.
      * The principle we need is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

   * The image shows a square ABCD with a semicircle drawn inside it, with point A as the center of the semicircle. Point T lies on the semicircle and point C is on the square. Line segment CT is tangent to the semicircle at point T. We are asked to find the measure of angle ∠CTD.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   * **Step 1:** Identify key geometric relationships.
      * **Operation:**  Recognizing geometric properties.
      * **Reasoning:**  We need to understand the relationships between the angles and lines in the diagram to solve for the unknown angle.
      * **Explanation:**  
          *  Since CT is tangent to the semicircle at T, we know that ∠CTB is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because a tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
          *  We also know that ∠BTC is an inscribed angle of the semicircle, which means it intercepts a diameter of the semicircle (line segment AB).  Inscribed angles that intercept a diameter are always right angles.

   * **Step 2:** Apply the angle sum property of triangles.
      * **Operation:**  Adding angles in a triangle.
      * **Reasoning:**  The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
      * **Explanation:**  
          *  In triangle CTD, we have: ∠CTD + ∠CDT + ∠TCD = 180 degrees.
          *  We know ∠CTB = 90 degrees (from Step 1).
          *  Since ABCD is a square, ∠CDT = 90 degrees.
          *  Therefore, ∠CTD + 90 degrees + 90 degrees = 180 degrees.

   * **Step 3:** Solve for the unknown angle.
      * **Operation:**  Subtracting angles.
      * **Reasoning:**  We can isolate the unknown angle by subtracting the known angles from the total angle sum.
      * **Explanation:**  
          *  ∠CTD + 180 degrees = 180 degrees.
          *  ∠CTD = 180 degrees - 180 degrees = 0 degrees.

3. **Solution Verification:**
   * **Final Answer:** ∠CTD = 0 degrees.
   * **Verification Method:**  We can verify our answer by checking if it makes sense in the context of the diagram. Since CT is tangent to the semicircle, and the semicircle is part of the square, it makes sense that ∠CTD would be 0 degrees. This is because the tangent line CT would essentially be coinciding with the side of the square CD.
