643,"As shown in the figure, CD is the diameter of ⊙O, chord DE ∥ OA, if the degree of ∠D is 50.0, then the degree of ∠C is ()",25°,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding the Concepts**

* **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle's measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Central Angle Theorem:** A central angle's measure is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
* **Parallel Lines:** When parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.

**Solution**

1. **Find the measure of arc DE:** Since ∠D is an inscribed angle intercepting arc DE, we have:
   ∠D = 1/2 * arc DE
   50° = 1/2 * arc DE
   arc DE = 100°

2. **Find the measure of arc AC:** Since CD is a diameter, arc CAD is a semicircle, measuring 180°.  Therefore:
   arc AC = arc CAD - arc DE = 180° - 100° = 80°

3. **Find the measure of ∠C:**  ∠C is a central angle intercepting arc AC.  Therefore:
   ∠C = arc AC = 80°

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Understanding the problem:** We have two intersecting lines AB and CD, forming four angles.  A ray OE bisects angle BOC. We know angle AOD is 70 degrees, and we need to find angle AOE.

2. **Using angle relationships:**
   * **Vertical angles:** Angles AOD and BOC are vertical angles, meaning they are equal. Therefore, angle BOC is also 70 degrees.
   * **Angle bisector:** Ray OE bisects angle BOC, meaning it divides angle BOC into two equal angles.  Therefore, angle BOE is half of angle BOC, which is 70/2 = 35 degrees.

3. **Finding angle AOE:**
   * **Adjacent angles:** Angles BOE and AOE are adjacent angles, meaning they share a common side (OE) and form a straight angle (180 degrees).  Therefore, angle AOE + angle BOE = 180 degrees.

The force due to particle 1 is attractive and points in the negative x direction. The force due to particle 2 is repulsive and points in the positive x direction. The force due to particle 4 is attractive and points in the negative x direction.

The magnitude of the force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law:

1. Since N is the midpoint of BC, we have BN = NC.
2. Since AM bisects ∠BAC, we have ∠BAM = ∠CAM.
3. Since BM⊥AM, we have ∠AMB = ∠CMN = 90°.
4. Therefore, triangles ABM and ACN are similar triangles (AA similarity).
5. From the similarity, we have AB/AC = BM/CN.
6. Since BM = MN + BN = 2 + BN and CN = BN, we have AB/AC = (2 + BN)/BN.
7. Substituting AB = 8, we get 8/AC = (2 + BN)/BN.
8. Solving for AC, we get AC = 8BN/(2 + BN).
9. Since MN = 2 and BN = NC, we have BC = 2BN + 2 = 2(BN + 1).
10. Since AB = 8 and BC = 2(BN + 1), we have AC = √(AB² + BC²) = √(8² + [2(BN + 1)]²) = √(64 + 4BN² + 8BN + 4) = √(4BN² + 8BN + 68).
11. Substituting AC = 8BN/(2 + BN) into the above equation, we get 8BN/(2 + BN) = √(4BN² + 8BN + 68).
12. Squaring both sides, we get 64BN²/(4 + 4BN + BN²) = 4BN² + 8BN + 68.
13. Simplifying the equation, we get 64BN² = 16BN² + 32BN + 272.

1. **Angle Bisectors:** Since BE bisects ∠FBD, we have ∠FBE = ∠EBD. Similarly, since CE bisects ∠ACD, we have ∠ACE = ∠ECD.

2. **Angle Sum Property:** In triangle BEC, we have ∠BEC + ∠BCE + ∠CBE = 180°.  Substituting the given value of ∠BEC = 35° and using the angle bisector property, we get:

   35° + ∠ACE + ∠EBD = 180°

3. **Combining Angles:**  Notice that ∠FAE = ∠FAB + ∠BAE.  Also, ∠FAB = ∠FBE and ∠BAE = ∠EBD.  Therefore:

   ∠FAE = ∠FBE + ∠EBD

4. **Substitution:** Substituting the value of ∠FBE + ∠EBD from step 2, we get:

   ∠FAE = 180° - 35° - ∠ACE - ∠EBD = 145° - ∠ACE - ∠EBD

5. **Final Calculation:** Since ∠ACE = ∠ECD and ∠EBD = ∠FBE, we can rewrite the above equation as:

   ∠FAE = 145° - 2∠ACE = 145° - 2∠ECD

   Since ∠ECD is half of ∠ACD, we have ∠ACD = 2∠ECD.  Therefore:

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference:** Since AB is the diameter of the circle, ∠AOB is a straight angle, which is 180°.  ∠AOF is given as 40°, so ∠BOF = 180° - 40° = 140°.  Since OF is a radius, ∠FOB is an angle at the center, and ∠F is an angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc FB. Therefore, ∠F = 1/2 * ∠FOB = 1/2 * 140° = 70°.

2. **Equal chords subtend equal angles:**  Since E is the midpoint of FEB, EF = EB.  Equal chords subtend equal angles at the circumference, so ∠F = ∠B.

4. **Angles on a straight line add up to 180°:**  Since EF and AB intersect at C, ∠FEC + ∠FEB = 180°.  We know ∠FEB = 40°, so ∠FEC = 180° - 40° = 140°.

5. **Angles in a triangle add up to 180°:** In triangle FEC, ∠FEC + ∠FCE + ∠CFE = 180°.  We know ∠FEC = 140° and ∠CFE = 70°, so ∠FCE = 180° - 140° - 70° = -30°.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find a point M on BC and a point N on CD such that the perimeter of triangle AMN is minimized. This means we want to find the shortest possible path from A to M to N and back to A.

2. **Using Reflections:**  Imagine reflecting point A across line BC to get point A'. Similarly, reflect point A across line CD to get point A''.

3. **Angle Sum Property:** The angles in a triangle add up to 180°. In △ABC, we have: ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.

4. **Finding ∠C:**  Substituting the known values, we get: 22° + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.  Since ∠B = ∠E (corresponding angles of congruent triangles), we can rewrite this as: 22° + ∠E + ∠C = 180°.

5. **Finding ∠BCD:**  ∠CGF is an exterior angle of △BCD.  The measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, ∠CGF = ∠BCD + ∠CBD.  We know ∠CGF = 88° and ∠CBD = ∠E, so 88° = ∠BCD + ∠E.

1. **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  Angle BCD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BD. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, arc BD measures 2 * 25° = 50°.

2. **Central Angle Theorem:** Angle AOD is a central angle that intercepts the same arc BD. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, angle AOD measures 50°.

3. **Using Symmetry:**  Since A and B are symmetrical, ∠BAM = ∠MAP. Similarly, ∠QAN = ∠QCN.

2. **Divide into Strips:** Imagine dividing the triangle into thin horizontal strips. Each strip has a small mass dm.

3. **Center of Mass of a Strip:** The center of mass of each strip is at its midpoint, which is at a distance y from the base of the triangle.

4. **Weighted Average:** The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the entire triangle is the weighted average of the y-coordinates of the centers of mass of all the strips. This can be expressed as:

   y_cm = (∫ y dm) / (∫ dm)

5. **Relating Mass and Area:** Since the triangle has uniform areal density, the mass of each strip is proportional to its area. The area of a strip is approximately dA = w dy, where w is the width of the strip.

6. **Finding w:** The width of the strip at a distance y from the base is w = 2(a - y).

2. **Apply the theorem:** In the given diagram, the two tangents are the segments with lengths 12 and 8. Therefore, the segments from the external point to the points of tangency are congruent. This means the segment with length 12 is also 12.

3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** We now have a right triangle with legs of length 12 and 15, and we need to find the hypotenuse (x). We can use the Pythagorean Theorem: a² + b² = c²

4. **Solve for x:**
   * 12² + 15² = x²
   * 144 + 225 = x²
   * 369 = x²
   * x = √369 ≈ 19.2

Therefore, x is approximately 19.2.",False,0,3.1938531398773193,560.0
364,"As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of ⊙O, and points C and D are on ⊙O. If ∠ABD = 50.0, then the degree of ∠BCD is ()",40°,"The answer is 40.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**  ∠ABD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AD.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

2. **Central Angle Theorem:** ∠AOD is a central angle that intercepts the same arc AD. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

3. **Relationship:** Since ∠ABD = 50°, then arc AD = 2 * 50° = 100°.  Therefore, ∠AOD = 100°.

4. **Linear Pair:** ∠AOD and ∠BOD are a linear pair, meaning they add up to 180°.  So, ∠BOD = 180° - 100° = 80°.

5. **Inscribed Angle Theorem (again):** ∠BCD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BD.  Therefore, ∠BCD = 1/2 * ∠BOD = 1/2 * 80° = 40°.

990,"In $\odot S$, $m \widehat {PQR}=98$, Find $m \widehat {PQ}$.",49,"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Understanding the Diagram:**  The diagram shows a circle with center S.  Line segment QS is a diameter of the circle, and line segment PR is a chord.

* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Central Angle Theorem:** The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
    * **Arc Addition Postulate:** The measure of an arc formed by two adjacent arcs is the sum of the measures of the two arcs.

* **Solution:**
    1. Since QS is a diameter,  $m \widehat {PQR} = 180^\circ$.
    2. We know $m \widehat {PQR} = 98^\circ$.
    3. Using the Arc Addition Postulate, we have:  $m \widehat {PQ} + m \widehat {QR} = m \widehat {PQR}$.
    4. Substituting the known values: $m \widehat {PQ} + 98^\circ = 180^\circ$.
    5. Solving for $m \widehat {PQ}$: $m \widehat {PQ} = 180^\circ - 98^\circ = 82^\circ$.

**Therefore,  $m \widehat {PQ} = 82^\circ$.**",False,0,3.3211190700531006,580.0
930,如图，F是△ABC的角平分线CD和BE的交点，CG⊥AB于点G．若∠ACG＝32°，则∠BFC的度数是（）,119°,"The answer is 116°.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Angle Properties:**
   - Since CG is perpendicular to AB, we know ∠CGA = 90°.
   - We are given ∠ACG = 32°.

2. **Triangle Sum:**
   - In triangle ACG, the angles add up to 180°. Therefore, ∠CAG = 180° - ∠CGA - ∠ACG = 180° - 90° - 32° = 58°.

3. **Angle Bisector:**
   - CD is the angle bisector of ∠ACB, meaning ∠ACD = ∠BCD.
   - Since ∠ACG = 32°, we have ∠ACD = ∠BCD = 32°/2 = 16°.

4. **Triangle Sum (Again):**
   - In triangle ACD, the angles add up to 180°. Therefore, ∠CAD = 180° - ∠ACD - ∠CDA = 180° - 16° - 90° = 74°.

5. **Angle Addition:**
   - ∠CAF = ∠CAG + ∠GAD = 58° + 74° = 132°.

6. **Angle Bisector (Again):**
   - BE is the angle bisector of ∠ABC, meaning ∠ABE = ∠CBE.

7. **Triangle Sum (Yet Again):**
   - In triangle ABC, the angles add up to 180°. Therefore, ∠ABC = 180° - ∠BAC - ∠ACB = 180° - 132° - 32° = 16°.
   - Since BE is the angle bisector, ∠ABE = ∠CBE = 16°/2 = 8°.

8. **Angle Addition (Again):**
   - ∠ABF = ∠ABE + ∠EBF = 8° + 16° = 24°.

9. **Triangle Sum (One Last Time):**
   - In triangle ABF, the angles add up to 180°. Therefore, ∠BFC = 180° - ∠ABF - ∠BAF = 180° - 24° - 42° = 116°.

955,如图．点O是正五边形ABCDE的中心，⊙O是正五边形的外接圆，∠ADE的度数为（）,36°,"The answer is 108 degrees. Here's why:

* **Regular Pentagon:** A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles.
* **Central Angle:**  The central angle of a regular pentagon (the angle formed by connecting two vertices to the center) is 360 degrees / 5 sides = 72 degrees.
* **Angle at the Vertex:**  Each angle of a regular pentagon is (5-2) * 180 degrees / 5 sides = 108 degrees.
* **Angle ADE:**  Angle ADE is half of the angle at vertex A (108 degrees / 2 = 54 degrees). 
* **Angle AOE:**  Angle AOE is the central angle of the pentagon (72 degrees).
* **Angle DOE:**  Angle DOE is the sum of angles AOE and ADE (72 degrees + 54 degrees = 126 degrees).
* **Angle ADE:**  Finally, angle ADE is half of angle DOE (126 degrees / 2 = 63 degrees).

Therefore, the degree measure of angle ADE is **63 degrees**.
