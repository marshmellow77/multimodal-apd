<EXPLANATION>
I have some prompts along with their corresponding accuracies.
The prompts are arranged in ascending order based on their accuracy, where higher accuracy indicate better quality.

Each prompt was used together with an image that depicts a math problem.

<TASK>
Write a new prompt that will achieve an accuracy as high as possible and that is different from the old ones.
</TASK>

<RULES>
- It is very important that the new prompt is distinct from ALL the old ones!
- Write your text in square brackets. Use only plain text for the prompt text and do not add any markdown (i.e. no hashtags, backticks, quotes, etc).
- Use common techniques (chain of thought, etc) to try to improve the prompt.
