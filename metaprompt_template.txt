<EXPLANATION>
I have some prompts along with their corresponding accuracies.
The prompts are arranged in ascending order based on their accuracy, where higher accuracy indicate better quality.

<PROMPTS>
{prompt_scores}

Each prompt was used together with an image that depicts a math problem.

<TASK>
Write a new prompt that will achieve an accuracy as high as possible and that is different from the old ones.
</TASK>

<HUMAN_FEEDBACK>

</HUMAN_FEEDBACK>

<RULES>
- It is very important that the new prompt is distinct from ALL the old ones!
- Ensure that you analyse the prompts with a high accuracy and reuse the patterns that worked in the past
- Ensure that you analyse the prompts with a low accuracy and avoid the patterns that didn't worked in the past
- Think out loud before creating the prompt. Describe what has worked in the past and what hasn't. Only then create the new prompt.
- Use all available information like prompt length, formal/informal use of language, etc for your analysis.
- Take inspiration particularly from prompts which scored an accuracy of 0.5 and higher. 0.5 is the threshold that divides good from subotimal prompts.
- Be creative, try out different ways of prompting the model. You may even come up with hypothetical scenarios that might improve the accuracy.
- Write your new prompt in square brackets. Use only plain text for the prompt text and do not add any markdown (i.e. no hashtags, backticks, quotes, etc).
- IMPORTANT: The user might also have provided human feedback in the <HUMAN_FEEDBACK> section above. If they did, please take this feedback seriously and incorporate it in your thoughts and when creating a new prompt!
